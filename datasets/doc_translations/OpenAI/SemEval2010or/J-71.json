Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM). A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both. Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution. The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share. The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand. Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in. I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.

INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events. The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM). The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker. Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism. Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct. Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets. These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting. Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders. A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution. But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin. A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders. A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses. Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available. As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well. Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker. Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers. However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close. For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information. Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed. Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings. In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM). A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA. A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk). A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market. The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation. A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution. A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA. The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering. If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases. Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired. The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs. DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed. While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism. Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games. In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future. After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered. More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered. That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered. An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars. In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet. Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B. The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B. Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race). People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total. People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees). Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25. Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed. The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome. As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available. Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen. Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes. So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates. This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed. Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close. However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM. If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1. Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss. Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying. A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker. In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk. The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time. It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios. There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high). Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging. Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics. But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market. Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market. This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market. In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17]. A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common. The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA). The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible. Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16]. Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes. So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs. In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur. Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down. In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14]. Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19]. A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell. If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask). If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur. In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset. Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk. However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade. As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs. The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices. We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades. The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm. Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk. Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA. In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes. Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet. The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread. While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM. One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker. Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand. Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk. Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM. Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price. An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market. The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded. An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events. At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution. In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution. In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate. Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity. An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system. An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker. In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close. While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar. Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes. The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently. The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3. A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase. So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A. A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other. Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur. The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome. There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds. For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward. Denote the two outcomes A and B. The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive. Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2. Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively. These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand. Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed. At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B). However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each. These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2. For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation. Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B. There are many ways to formulate the price function. Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information. A standard pari-mutuel fails (3). A CDA fails (1). A CDAwMM, the bookmaker mechanism, and an MSR all fail (2). Even though technically an MSR exposes its patron to risk (i.e., a variable future payoff), the patrons maximum loss is bounded, so the distinction between a DPM and an MSR in terms of these three properties is more technical than practical. DPM traders can cash out of the market early, just like stock market traders, to lock in a profit or limit a loss, an action that is simply not possible in a standard pari-mutuel. A DPM also has some drawbacks. The payoff for a wager depends both on the price at the time of the trade, and on the final payoff per share at the markets close. This contrasts with the CDA variants, where the payoff vector across possible future outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade. So a traders strategic optimization problem is complicated by the need to predict the final values of P1 and P2. If P changes according to a random walk, then traders can take the current P as an unbiased estimate of the final P, greatly decreasing the complexity of their optimization. If P does not change according to a random walk, the mechanism still has utility as a mechanism for hedging and speculating, though optimization may be difficult, and determining a measure of the markets aggregate opinion of the probabilities of A and B may be difficult. We discuss the implications of random walk behavior further below in Section 4.1 in the discussion surrounding Assumption 3. A second drawback of a DPM is its one-sided nature. 173 While an automated market maker always stands ready to accept buy orders, there is no corresponding market maker to accept sell orders. Traders must sell to each other using a standard CDA mechanism, for example by posting an ask order at a price at or below the market makers current ask price. Traders can also always hedge-sell by purchasing shares in the opposite outcome from the market maker, thereby hedging their bet if not fully liquidating it. 3.3 Redistribution rule In a standard pari-mutuel market, payoffs can be computed in either of two equivalent ways: (1) each winning $1 wager receives a refund of the initial $1 paid, plus an equal share of all losing wagers, or (2) each winning $1 wager receives an equal share of all wagers, winning or losing. Because each dollar always earns an equal share of the payoff, the two formulations are precisely the same: $1 + Mlose Mwin = Mwin + Mlose Mwin . In a dynamic pari-mutuel market, because each dollar is not equally weighted, the two formulations are distinct, and lead to significantly different price functions and mechanisms, each with different potentially desirable properties. We consider each case in turn. The next section analyzes case (1), where only losing money is redistributed. Section 5 examines case (2), where all money is redistributed. 4. DPM I: LOSING MONEY REDISTRIBUTED For the case where the initial payments on winning bets are refunded, and only losing money is redistributed, the respective payoffs per share are simply: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2 . So, if A occurs, shareholders of A receive all of their initial payment back, plus P1 dollars per share owned, while shareholders of B lose all money wagered. Similarly, if B occurs, shareholders of B receive all of their initial payment back, plus P2 dollars per share owned, while shareholders of A lose all money wagered. Without loss of generality, I will analyze the market from the perspective of A, deriving prices and payoffs for A only. The equations for B are symmetric. The traders per-share expected value for purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A is E[ shares] = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 E[ shares] = Pr(A) · E » M2 N1 ˛ ˛ ˛ ˛ A − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 where is an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A, Pr(A) is the traders belief in the probability of A, and p1 is the instantaneous price per share of A for an infinitesimal quantity of shares. E[P1|A] is the traders expectation of the payoff per share of A after the market closes and given that A occurs. This is a subtle point. The value of P1 does not matter if B occurs, since in this case shares of A are worthless, and the current value of P1 does not necessarily matter as this may change as trading continues. So, in order to determine the expected value of shares of A, the trader must estimate what he or she expects the payoff per share to be in the end (after the market closes) if A occurs. If E[ shares]/ > 0, a risk-neutral trader should purchase shares of A. How many shares? This depends on the price function determining p1. In general, p1 increases as more shares are purchased. The risk-neutral trader should continue purchasing shares until E[ shares]/ = 0. (A riskaverse trader will generally stop purchasing shares before driving E[ shares]/ all the way to zero.) Assuming riskneutrality, the traders optimization problem is to choose a number of shares n ≥ 0 of A to purchase, in order to maximize E[n shares] = Pr(A)·n·E [P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· Z n 0 p1(n)dn. (1) Its easy to see that the same value of n can be solved for by finding the number of shares required to drive E[ shares]/ to zero. That is, find n ≥ 0 satisfying 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), if such a n exists, otherwise n = 0. 4.1 Market probability As traders who believe that E[ shares of A]/ > 0 purchase shares of A and traders who believe that E[ shares of B]/ > 0 purchase shares of B, the prices p1 and p2 change according to a price function, as prescribed below. The current prices in a sense reflect the markets opinion as a whole of the relative probabilities of A and B. Assuming an efficient marketplace, the market as a whole considers E[ shares]/ = 0, since the mechanisms is a zero sum game. For example, if market participants in aggregate felt that E[ shares]/ > 0, then there would be net demand for A, driving up the price of A until E[ shares]/ = 0. Define MPr(A) to be the market probability of A, or the probability of A inferred by assuming that E[ shares]/ = 0. We can consider MPr(A) to be the aggregate probability of A as judged by the market as a whole. MPr(A) is the solution to 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) At this point we make a critical assumption in order to greatly simplify the analysis; we assume that E[P1|A] = P1. (3) That is, we assume that the current value for the payoff per share of A is the same as the expected final value of the payoff per share of A given that A occurs. This is certainly true for the last (infinitesimal) wager before the market closes. Its not obvious, however, that the assumption is true well before the markets close. Basically, we are assuming that the value of P1 moves according to an unbiased random walk: the current value of P1 is the best expectation of its future value. I conjecture that there are reasonable market efficiency conditions under which assumption (3) is true, though I have not been able to prove that it arises naturally from rational trading. We examine scenarios below in which 174 assumption (3) seems especially plausible. Nonetheless, the assumption effects our analysis only. Regardless of whether (3) is true, each price function derived below implies a welldefined zero-sum game in which traders can play. If traders can assume that (3) is true, then their optimization problem (1) is greatly simplified; however, optimizing (1) does not depend on the assumption, and traders can still optimize by strategically projecting the final expected payoff in whatever complicated way they desire. So, the utility of DPM for hedging and speculating does not necessarily hinge on the truth of assumption (3). On the other hand, the ability to easily infer an aggregate market consensus probability from market prices does depend on (3). 4.2 Price functions A variety of price functions seem reasonable, each exhibiting various properties, and implying differing market probabilities. 4.2.1 Price function I: Price of A equals payoff of B One natural price function to consider is to set the price per share of A equal to the payoff per share of B, and set the price per share of B equal to the payoff per share of A. That is, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Enforcing this relationship reduces the dimensionality of the system from four to two, simplifying the interface: traders need only track two numbers instead of four. The relationship makes sense, since new information supporting A should encourage purchasing of shares A, driving up both the price of A and the payoff of B, and driving down the price of B and the payoff of A. In this setting, assumption (3) seems especially reasonable, since if an efficient market hypothesis leads prices to follow a random walk, than payoffs must also follow a random walk. The constraints (4) lead to the following derivation of the market probability: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) The constraints (4) specify the instantaneous relationship between payoff and price. From this, we can derive how prices change when (non-infinitesimal) shares are purchased. Let n be the number of shares purchased and let m be the amount of money spent purchasing n shares. Note that p1 = dm/dn, the instantaneous price per share, and m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Substituting into equation (4), we get: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) Equation 6 gives the cost of purchasing n shares. The instantaneous price per share as a function of n is p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2 . (7) Note that p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 as required. The derivation of the price function p2(n) for B is analogous and the results are symmetric. The notion of buying infinitesimal shares, or integrating costs over a continuous function, are probably foreign to most traders. A more standard interface can be implemented by discretizing the costs into round lots of shares, for example lots of 100 shares. Then ask orders of 100 shares each at the appropriate price can be automatically placed by the market institution. For example, the market institution can place an ask order for 100 shares at price m(100)/100, another ask order for 100 shares at price (m(200)−m(100))/100, a third ask for 100 shares at (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. In this way, the market looks more familiar to traders, like a typical CDA with a number of ask orders at various prices automatically available. A trader buying less than 100 shares would pay a bit more than if the true cost were computed using (6), but the discretized interface would probably be more intuitive and transparent to the majority of traders. The above equations assume that all money that comes in is eventually returned or redistributed. In other words, the mechanism is a zero sum game, and the market institution takes no portion of the money. This could be generalized so that the market institution always takes a certain amount, or a certain percent, or a certain amount per transaction, or a certain percent per transaction, before money in returned or redistributed. Finally, note that the above price function is undefined when the amount bet or the number of shares are zero. So the system must begin with some positive amount on both sides, and some positive number of shares outstanding on both sides. These initial amounts can be arbitrarily small in principle, but the size of the initial subsidy may affect the incentives of traders to participate. Also, the smaller the initial amounts, the more each new dollar effects the prices. The initialization amounts could be funded as a subsidy from the market institution or a patron, which Ill call a seed wager, or from a portion of the fees charged, which Ill call an ante wager. 4.2.2 Price function II: Price of A proportional to money on A A second price function can be derived by requiring the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered. 175 That is, p1 p2 = M1 M2 . (8) In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. This seems like a particularly natural way to set the price, since the more money that is wagered on one side, the cheaper becomes a share on the other side, in exactly the same proportion. Using Equation 8, along with (2) and (3), we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) We can solve for the instantaneous price as follows: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the implied cost function m as a function of the number n of shares purchased as follows: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) From this we get the price function: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Note that, as required, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, and p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B, which seems fairly natural. Note that, as before, the mechanism can be modified to collect transaction fees of some kind. Also note that seed or ante wagers are required to initialize the system. 5. DPM II: ALL MONEY REDISTRIBUTED Above we examined the policy of refunding winning wagers and redistributing only losing wagers. In this section we consider the second policy mentioned in Section 3.3: all money from all wagers are collected and redistributed to winning wagers. For the case where all money is redistributed, the respective payoffs per share are: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2 , where T = M1 + M2 is the total amount of money wagered on both sides. So, if A occurs, shareholders of A lose their initial price paid, but receive P1 dollars per share owned; shareholders of B simply lose all money wagered. Similarly, if B occurs, shareholders of B lose their initial price paid, but receive P2 dollars per share owned; shareholders of A lose all money wagered. In this case, the traders per-share expected value for purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A is E[ shares] = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − p1. (13) A risk-neutral trader optimizes by choosing a number of shares n ≥ 0 of A to purchase, in order to maximize E[n shares] = Pr(A) · n · E [P1|A] − Z n 0 p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E [P1|A] − m (14) The same value of n can be solved for by finding the number of shares required to drive E[ shares]/ to zero. That is, find n ≥ 0 satisfying 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − p1(n), if such a n exists, otherwise n = 0. 5.1 Market probability In this case MPr(A), the aggregate probability of A as judged by the market as a whole, is the solution to 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) As before, we make the simplifying assumption (3) that the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff per share. The assumption is critical for our analysis, but may not be required for a practical implementation. 5.2 Price functions For the case where all money is distributed, the constraints (4) that keep the price of A equal to the payoff of B, and vice versa, do not lead to the derivation of a coherent price function. A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered. That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2. In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. 176 Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with the constraints that the price of A equal the payoff of B and vice versa. The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Note that we solved for n(m) rather than m(n). I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above. Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically. From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B. This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3). That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0. The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even. The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs. This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7. When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff. Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7. On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money. Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome. From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks. One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome. At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price. Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6. OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0. In this case, prices would only go up. For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome. Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket. I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above. Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists. Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7. AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss. This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker. So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker. Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price. Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple. In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism. Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares. New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader. In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket. However, an aftermarket is still possible. In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue. In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise. One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components. However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM. In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets. The bundling mechanism works as follows. Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1. A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1. The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars. If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket. The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling. Consider a share of A purchased for $5. The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A. Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit. The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A. The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff. So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment. The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains. Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share. The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2. The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded). The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A. The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5. If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3. Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8. CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM). The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation. To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties. An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics. Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased. The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price. I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed. Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions. I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9. FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market. Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture. The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis. Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when? How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests. This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism. However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment. In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market. I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time. The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables. I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100). However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting. I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task. DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen. Acknowledgments I thank Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow, and Robin Hanson. 10. REFERENCES [1] Mukhtar M.

Desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo para la asignación de riesgos y especulación de información llamado mercado pari-mutuel dinámico (DPM). Un DPM actúa como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y una subasta doble continua (CDA), heredando algunas de las ventajas de ambos. Al igual que un mercado de pari-mutuel, un DPM ofrece liquidez infinita para la compra y cero riesgo para la institución del mercado; al igual que un CDA, un DPM puede reaccionar continuamente a nueva información, incorporar dinámicamente la información en los precios y permitir a los traders asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas vendiendo antes de la resolución del evento. La interfaz del operador puede ser diseñada para imitar el formato familiar de subasta doble con colas de oferta y demanda, aunque con una variable adicional llamada la ganancia por acción. La función de precio de DPM se puede ver como un creador de mercado automatizado que siempre ofrece vender a cierto precio, y ajusta el precio adecuadamente según la demanda. Dado que el mecanismo es de tipo pari-mutuel (es decir, redistributivo), se garantiza que pagará exactamente la cantidad de dinero recaudada.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

        "A Dynamic Pari-Mutuel Market for Hedging, Wagering, and Information Aggregation David M. Pennock Yahoo!",
        "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
        "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
        "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
        "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
        "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
        "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
        "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
        "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
        "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
        "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
        "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
        "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
        "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
        "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
        "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
        "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
        "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
        "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
        "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
        "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
        "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
        "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
        "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
        "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
        "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
        "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
        "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
        "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
        "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
        "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
        "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
        "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
        "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
        "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
        "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
        "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
        "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
        "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
        "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
        "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
        "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
        "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
        "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
        "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
        "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
        "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
        "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
        "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
        "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
        "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
        "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
        "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
        "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
        "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
        "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
        "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
        "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
        "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
        "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
        "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
        "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
        "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
        "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
        "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
        "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
        "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
        "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
        "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
        "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",

        "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
        "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
        "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
        "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
        "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
        "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
        "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
        "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
        "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
        "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
        "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
        "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
        "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
        "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
        "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
        "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
        "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
        "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
        "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
        "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
        "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
        "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
        "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
        "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
        "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
        "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
        "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
        "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
        "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
        "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
        "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
        "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
        "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
        "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
        "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
        "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
        "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
        "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
        "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
        "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
        "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
        "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
        "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
        "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
        "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
        "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
        "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
        "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
        "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
        "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
        "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
        "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
        "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",

        "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
        "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
        "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",

        "We discuss the implications of random walk behavior further below in Section 4.1 in the discussion surrounding Assumption 3.",

        "On the other hand, the ability to easily infer an aggregate market consensus probability from market prices does depend on (3). 4.2 Price functions A variety of price functions seem reasonable, each exhibiting various properties, and implying differing market probabilities. 4.2.1 Price function I: Price of A equals payoff of B One natural price function to consider is to set the price per share of A equal to the payoff per share of B, and set the price per share of B equal to the payoff per share of A.",

        "The notion of buying infinitesimal shares, or integrating costs over a continuous function, are probably foreign to most traders.",
        "A more standard interface can be implemented by discretizing the costs into round lots of shares, for example lots of 100 shares.",
        "Then ask orders of 100 shares each at the appropriate price can be automatically placed by the market institution.",
        "For example, the market institution can place an ask order for 100 shares at price m(100)/100, another ask order for 100 shares at price (m(200)−m(100))/100, a third ask for 100 shares at (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc.",
        "In this way, the market looks more familiar to traders, like a typical CDA with a number of ask orders at various prices automatically available.",

        "In other words, the mechanism is a zero sum game, and the market institution takes no portion of the money.",
        "This could be generalized so that the market institution always takes a certain amount, or a certain percent, or a certain amount per transaction, or a certain percent per transaction, before money in returned or redistributed.",
        "Finally, note that the above price function is undefined when the amount bet or the number of shares are zero.",
        "So the system must begin with some positive amount on both sides, and some positive number of shares outstanding on both sides.",
        "These initial amounts can be arbitrarily small in principle, but the size of the initial subsidy may affect the incentives of traders to participate.",
        "Also, the smaller the initial amounts, the more each new dollar effects the prices.",

(8) In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B.",
        "This seems like a particularly natural way to set the price, since the more money that is wagered on one side, the cheaper becomes a share on the other side, in exactly the same proportion.",
        "Using Equation 8, along with (2) and (3), we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) We can solve for the instantaneous price as follows: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the implied cost function m as a function of the number n of shares purchased as follows: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) From this we get the price function: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Note that, as required, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, and p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
        "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B, which seems fairly natural.",

        "Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) As before, we make the simplifying assumption (3) that the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff per share.",
        "The assumption is critical for our analysis, but may not be required for a practical implementation. 5.2 Price functions For the case where all money is distributed, the constraints (4) that keep the price of A equal to the payoff of B, and vice versa, do not lead to the derivation of a coherent price function.",
        "A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.",
        "That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2.",
        "In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. 176 Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with the constraints that the price of A equal the payoff of B and vice versa.",
        "The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) .",
        "Note that we solved for n(m) rather than m(n).",
        "I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above.",
        "Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically.",
        "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
        "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
        "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
        "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
        "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
        "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
        "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
        "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
        "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
        "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
        "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
        "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
        "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
        "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
        "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
        "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
        "In this case, prices would only go up.",
        "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
        "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
        "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
        "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
        "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
        "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
        "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
        "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
        "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
        "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
        "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
        "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
        "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
        "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
        "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
        "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
        "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
        "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
        "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
        "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
        "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
        "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
        "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
        "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
        "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
        "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
        "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
        "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
        "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
        "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
        "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
        "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
        "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
        "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
        "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
        "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
        "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
        "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
        "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
        "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
        "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
        "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
        "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
        "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
        "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
        "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
        "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
        "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
        "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
        "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
        "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
        "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
        "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
        "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
        "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
        "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
        "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
        "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
        "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
        "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
        "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
        "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
        "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",

        "Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada.",
        "Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado.",
        "Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado.",
        "Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares.",
        "En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada.",
        "Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B.",
        "Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
        "Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B.",
        "Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera).",
        "Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total.",
        "Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones).",
        "Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25.",
        "Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta.",
        "El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto.",
        "Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible.",
        "Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto.",
        "Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado.",
        "Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales.",
        "Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información.",
        "Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados.",
        "Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM.",
        "Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1.",
        "Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida.",
        "A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar.",
        "Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado.",
        "En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo.",
        "La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo.",
        "No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas.",
        "No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto).",
        "Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura.",
        "Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información.",
        "Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual.",
        "Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular.",
        "Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual.",
        "En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17].",
        "Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común.",
        "El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA).",
        "El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos.",
        "Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado.",
        "Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados.",
        "Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado.",
        "En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto.",
        "De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará.",
        "En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14].",
        "Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19].",
        "Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta.",
        "Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask).",
        "Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones.",
        "En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo.",
        "Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo.",
        "Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio.",
        "Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial.",
        "La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos.",
        "Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones.",
        "El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado.",
        "Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo.",
        "Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA.",
        "En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados.",
        "A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta.",
        "El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda.",
        "Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM.",
        "Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas.",
        "Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores.",
        "Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo.",
        "Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM.",
        "Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio.",
        "Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado.",
        "La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada.",
        "Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos.",
        "En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución.",
        "En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad.",
        "En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada.",
        "Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez.",
        "Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema.",
        "Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado.",
        "En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados.",
        "Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares.",
        "Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados.",
        "El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente.",
        "El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado.",
        "Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra.",
        "Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A.",
        "Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro.",
        "La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido.",
        "La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado.",
        "No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio.",
        "Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla.",
        "Denote los dos resultados A y B.",
        "Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios.",
        "Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2.",
        "Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente.",
        "Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender.",
        "Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento.",
        "En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B).",
        "Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno.",
        "Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2.",
        "Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional.",
        "Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B.",
        "Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio.",
        "A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información.",
        "Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3).",
        "Un CDA falla.",
        "Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2).",
        "Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica.",
        "Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar.",
        "Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas.",
        "El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados.",
        "Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio.",
        "Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2.",
        "Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización.",
        "Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado.",
        "Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3.",
        "Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta.",
        "Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado.",
        "Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras.",
        "Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar.",
        "En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes.",
        "Consideramos cada caso en turno.",
        "La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido.",
        "La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4.",
        "DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2.",
        "Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado.",
        "Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado.",
        "Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A.",
        "Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas.",
        "El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones.",
        "E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre.",
        "Este es un punto sutil.",
        "El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio.",
        "Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre.",
        "Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A.",
        "¿Cuántas acciones?",
        "Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1.",
        "En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones.",
        "El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero).",
        "Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero.",
        "Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación.",
        "Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B.",
        "Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero.",
        "Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0.",
        "Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0.",
        "Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto.",
        "MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1.",
        "Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre.",
        "Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado.",
        "No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados.",
        "Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro.",
        "Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional.",
        "Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible.",
        "Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis.",
        "Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar.",
        "Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen.",
        "Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3).",
        "Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A.",
        "Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro.",
        "La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A.",
        "En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio.",
        "Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio.",
        "A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales).",

        "La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders.",
        "Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones.",
        "Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado.",
        "Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc.",
        "De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente.",
        "Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores.",

        "Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios.",
        "Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B.",
        "Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción.",

(11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
        "Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural.",
        "Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo.",

        "DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras.",
        "En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras.",
        "Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados.",
        "Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado.",
        "Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado.",
        "En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero.",
        "Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1.",
        "Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción.",
        "La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente.",
        "Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado.",
        "Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2.",
        "En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa.",
        "El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) .",

        "No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores.",
        "Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado.",
        "A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
        "Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B.",
        "Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3).",
        "Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0.",
        "La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso.",
        "El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre.",
        "Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7.",
        "Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final.",
        "Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7.",
        "Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad.",
        "Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado.",
        "A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos.",
        "Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto.",
        "En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio.",
        "Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6.",
        "OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0.",

        "De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo.",
        "Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones.",
        "Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador.",
        "De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario.",
        "Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario.",
        "De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola.",
        "En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario.",
        "Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos.",
        "Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central.",
        "De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados.",
        "El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera.",
        "Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1.",
        "Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1.",
        "El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares.",
        "Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario.",
        "El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación.",
        "Considera una acción de A comprada por $5.",
        "La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A.",
        "Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias.",
        "El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A.",
        "La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final.",
        "Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial.",
        "El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias.",
        "Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción.",
        "El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2.",

        "La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5.",
        "Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3.",
        "También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8.",
        "CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM).",
        "El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información.",

        "Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones.",
        "La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio.",

                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",

                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",

                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",

La función de precio de DPM se puede ver como un creador de mercado automatizado que siempre ofrece vender a cierto precio, y ajusta el precio adecuadamente según la demanda.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",

                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",

                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",

                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",

                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",

                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",

                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n.

La función de precio de DPM se puede ver como un creador de mercado automatizado que siempre ofrece vender a cierto precio, y ajusta el precio adecuadamente según la demanda.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un <br>mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo</br> 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un <br>mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas</br>, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8.

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (<br>dpm</br>).",
                "A <br>dpm</br> acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a <br>dpm</br> offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a <br>dpm</br> can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The <br>dpm</br> price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic <br>dpm</br>, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (<br>dpm</br>).",
                "A <br>dpm</br> can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A <br>dpm</br> is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A <br>dpm</br> has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A <br>dpm</br> is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "<br>dpm</br> prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a <br>dpm</br>.",
                "Like a <br>dpm</br>, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a <br>dpm</br> provides a one-sided automated market maker.",

                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",

                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",

                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of <br>dpm</br> over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for <br>dpm</br> II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for <br>dpm</br> I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central <br>dpm</br>.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the <br>dpm</br> market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for <br>dpm</br> I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of <br>dpm</br> I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either <br>dpm</br> formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (<br>dpm</br>).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a <br>dpm</br> in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a <br>dpm</br>: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a <br>dpm</br> mechanism? • <br>dpm</br> call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that <br>dpm</br> may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a <br>hybrid</br> between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",

                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",
                "Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B.",
                "There are many ways to formulate the price function.",
                "Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information.",

                "We discuss the implications of random walk behavior further below in Section 4.1 in the discussion surrounding Assumption 3.",
                "A second drawback of a DPM is its one-sided nature. 173 While an automated market maker always stands ready to accept buy orders, there is no corresponding market maker to accept sell orders.",

                "Traders can also always hedge-sell by purchasing shares in the opposite outcome from the market maker, thereby hedging their bet if not fully liquidating it. 3.3 Redistribution rule In a standard pari-mutuel market, payoffs can be computed in either of two equivalent ways: (1) each winning $1 wager receives a refund of the initial $1 paid, plus an equal share of all losing wagers, or (2) each winning $1 wager receives an equal share of all wagers, winning or losing.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un <br>híbrido</br> entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "<br>pari-mutuel market</br> participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a <br>pari-mutuel market</br> and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a <br>pari-mutuel market</br>: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a <br>pari-mutuel market</br> people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a <br>pari-mutuel market</br> has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a <br>pari-mutuel market</br>, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a <br>pari-mutuel market</br>, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a <br>pari-mutuel market</br> is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a <br>pari-mutuel market</br> can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated <br>pari-mutuel market</br>, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual <br>pari-mutuel market</br>, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual <br>pari-mutuel market</br>.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",

                "A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.",

                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",

                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard <br>pari-mutuel market</br> is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",

                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard <br>pari-mutuel market</br>, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic <br>pari-mutuel market</br>.",

                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",

                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",

La interfaz del operador puede ser diseñada para imitar el formato familiar de subasta doble con colas de oferta y demanda, aunque con una variable adicional llamada la ganancia por acción. La función de precio de DPM se puede ver como un creador de mercado automatizado que siempre ofrece vender a cierto precio, y ajusta el precio adecuadamente según la demanda. Dado que el mecanismo es de tipo pari-mutuel (es decir, redistributivo), se garantiza que pagará exactamente la cantidad de dinero recaudada.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del <br>mercado de apuestas mutuas</br> no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. ",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a <br>continuous double auction</br> (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the <br>continuous double auction</br> (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the <br>continuous double auction</br> (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la <br>subasta doble continua</br> (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la <br>subasta doble continua</br> (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (<br>cda</br>), or in some cases the <br>cda</br> with market maker (CDAwMM).",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A <br>cda</br> only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a <br>cda</br> can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful <br>cda</br> must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the <br>cda</br> and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",

                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a <br>cda</br>.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard <br>cda</br> mechanism.",

                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la <br>subasta doble continua</br> (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un <br>CDA</br> solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado.

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",

                "For the case where all money is redistributed, the respective payoffs per share are: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2 , where T = M1 + M2 is the total amount of money wagered on both sides.",
                "So, if A occurs, shareholders of A lose their initial price paid, but receive P1 dollars per share owned; shareholders of B simply lose all money wagered.",
                "Similarly, if B occurs, shareholders of B lose their initial price paid, but receive P2 dollars per share owned; shareholders of A lose all money wagered.",
                "In this case, the traders per-share expected value for purchasing an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A is E[ shares] = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − p1. (13) A risk-neutral trader optimizes by choosing a number of shares n ≥ 0 of A to purchase, in order to maximize E[n shares] = Pr(A) · n · E [P1|A] − Z n 0 p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E [P1|A] − m (14) The same value of n can be solved for by finding the number of shares required to drive E[ shares]/ to zero.",
                "That is, find n ≥ 0 satisfying 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − p1(n), if such a n exists, otherwise n = 0. 5.1 Market probability In this case MPr(A), the aggregate probability of A as judged by the market as a whole, is the solution to 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1.",
                "Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) As before, we make the simplifying assumption (3) that the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff per share.",
                "The assumption is critical for our analysis, but may not be required for a practical implementation. 5.2 Price functions For the case where all money is distributed, the constraints (4) that keep the price of A equal to the payoff of B, and vice versa, do not lead to the derivation of a coherent price function.",
                "A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.",
                "That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2.",
                "In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. 176 Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with the constraints that the price of A equal the payoff of B and vice versa.",
                "The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) .",
                "Note that we solved for n(m) rather than m(n).",
                "I could not find a closed-form solution for m(n), as was derived for the two other cases above.",
                "Still, n(m) can be used to determine how many shares can be purchased for m dollars, and the inverse function can be approximated to any degree numerically.",
                "From n(m) we can also compute the price function: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) where denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Note that, as required, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2.",
                "If one uses the above price function, then the market dynamics will be such that the ratio of the (instantaneous) prices of A and B always equals the ratio of the amounts wagered on A and B.",
                "This price function has another desirable property: it acts such that the expected value of wagering $1 on A and simultaneously wagering $1 on B equals zero, assuming (3).",
                "That is, E[$1 of A + $1 of B] = 0.",
                "The derivation is omitted. 5.3 Comparing DPM I and II The main advantage of refunding winning wagers (DPM I) is that every bet on the winning outcome is guaranteed to at least break even.",
                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",
                "I have derived price functions for several other cases, using the same methodology above.",
                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",
                "Further analyses and, more importantly, empirical investigations are required to answer these questions. 7.",
                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",
                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",

                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

Desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo para la asignación de riesgos y especulación de información llamado mercado pari-mutuel dinámico (DPM). Un DPM actúa como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y una subasta doble continua (CDA), heredando algunas de las ventajas de ambos. Al igual que un mercado de pari-mutuel, un DPM ofrece <br>liquidez infinita</br> para la compra y cero riesgo para la institución del mercado; al igual que un CDA, un DPM puede reaccionar continuamente a nueva información, incorporar dinámicamente la información en los precios y permitir a los traders asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas vendiendo antes de la resolución del evento. La interfaz del operador puede ser diseñada para imitar el formato familiar de subasta doble con colas de oferta y demanda, aunque con una variable adicional llamada la ganancia por acción. La función de precio de DPM se puede ver como un creador de mercado automatizado que siempre ofrece vender a cierto precio, y ajusta el precio adecuadamente según la demanda. Dado que el mecanismo es de tipo pari-mutuel (es decir, redistributivo), se garantiza que pagará exactamente la cantidad de dinero recaudada. Exploro varias variaciones del DPM básico, analizando las propiedades de cada una y resolviendo en forma cerrada sus respectivas funciones de precio.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the <br>market institution</br>; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the <br>market institution</br> and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the <br>market institution</br>.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the <br>market institution</br>, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the <br>market institution</br>, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the <br>market institution</br> to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the <br>market institution</br>, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the <br>market institution</br>.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The <br>market institution</br> changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the <br>market institution</br> (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the <br>market institution</br> itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",

                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",

                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",

                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",

                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",

Desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo para la asignación de riesgos y especulación de información llamado mercado pari-mutuel dinámico (DPM). Un DPM actúa como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y una subasta doble continua (CDA), heredando algunas de las ventajas de ambos. Al igual que un mercado de pari-mutuel, un DPM ofrece liquidez infinita para la compra y cero riesgo para la <br>institución del mercado</br>; al igual que un CDA, un DPM puede reaccionar continuamente a nueva información, incorporar dinámicamente la información en los precios y permitir a los traders asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas vendiendo antes de la resolución del evento. La interfaz del operador puede ser diseñada para imitar el formato familiar de subasta doble con colas de oferta y demanda, aunque con una variable adicional llamada la ganancia por acción. La función de precio de DPM se puede ver como un creador de mercado automatizado que siempre ofrece vender a cierto precio, y ajusta el precio adecuadamente según la demanda. Dado que el mecanismo es de tipo pari-mutuel (es decir, redistributivo), se garantiza que pagará exactamente la cantidad de dinero recaudada. Exploro varias variaciones del DPM básico, analizando las propiedades de cada una y resolviendo en forma cerrada sus respectivas funciones de precio.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la <br>institución del mercado</br> y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la <br>institución del mercado</br>. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la <br>institución del mercado</br>, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la <br>institución del mercado</br>, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. ",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to <br>event resolution</br>.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",
                "Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.",
                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",

                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",

                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para <br>vender</br>: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y <br>vender</br> caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"pos<br>venta</br>\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y <br>venta</br> están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. ",

                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar <br>ganancias</br> (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar <br>ganancias</br> o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar <br>ganancias</br> o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o <br>pérdida</br>. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La <br>pérdida</br> final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la <br>pérdida</br> máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la <br>pérdida</br> máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una <br>pérdida</br>, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin <br>pérdida</br> de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. ",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The <br>trader interface</br> can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",

                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",

                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",

                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",

                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n.

                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with <br>bid-ask queue</br>s, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty <br>bid-ask queue</br>s if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",
                "Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.",
                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",
                "Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso <br>colas vacías de oferta y demanda</br> si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el <br>pago por acción</br> se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del <br>pago final por acción</br> al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del <br>pago por acción</br> de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el <br>pago por acción</br> al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre.

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM <br>price function</br> can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a <br>price function</br>, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The <br>price function</br> determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the <br>price function</br> from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",
                "Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.",
                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a <br>price function</br> from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",
                "Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B.",
                "There are many ways to formulate the <br>price function</br>.",
                "Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information.",
                "A standard pari-mutuel fails (3).",
                "A CDA fails (1).",
                "A CDAwMM, the bookmaker mechanism, and an MSR all fail (2).",
                "Even though technically an MSR exposes its patron to risk (i.e., a variable future payoff), the patrons maximum loss is bounded, so the distinction between a DPM and an MSR in terms of these three properties is more technical than practical.",
                "DPM traders can cash out of the market early, just like stock market traders, to lock in a profit or limit a loss, an action that is simply not possible in a standard pari-mutuel.",
                "A DPM also has some drawbacks.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una <br>función de precios</br>, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La <br>función de precio</br> determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la <br>función de precio</br> de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una <br>función de precio</br> de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la <br>función de precio</br>. ",

                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",

                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n.

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",

                "Solving we get MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) As before, we make the simplifying assumption (3) that the expected final payoff per share equals the current payoff per share.",
                "The assumption is critical for our analysis, but may not be required for a practical implementation. 5.2 Price functions For the case where all money is distributed, the constraints (4) that keep the price of A equal to the payoff of B, and vice versa, do not lead to the derivation of a coherent price function.",
                "A reasonable price function can be derived from the constraint (8) employed in Section 4.2.2, where we require that the ratio of prices to be equal to the ratio of money wagered.",
                "That is, p1/p2 = M1/M2.",
                "In other words, the price of A is proportional to the amount of money wagered on A, and similarly for B. 176 Using Equations 3, 8, and 15 we can derive the implied market probability: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Interestingly, this is the same market probability derived in Section 4.2.1 for the case of losing-money redistribution with the constraints that the price of A equal the payoff of B and vice versa.",
                "The instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares is: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Working from the above instantaneous price, we can derive the number of shares n that can be purchased for m dollars, as follows: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) .",

                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",
                "This complicates the implementation of an aftermarket to cash out of the market early, which we will examine below in Section 7.",
                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",
                "OTHER VARIATIONS A simple ascending price function would set p1 = αM1 and p2 = αM2, where α > 0.",
                "In this case, prices would only go up.",
                "For the case of all money being redistributed, this would eliminate the possibility of losing money on a wager on the correct outcome.",
                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",

                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",

                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",
                "Or traders can place a limit sell order at any price.",
                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",
                "However, it is possible to automate the two aftermarkets, by automatically bundling them together in the correct ratio and selling them in the central DPM.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out by placing sell orders on the same queue as the DPM market maker, effectively hiding the complexity of explicitly having two separate aftermarkets.",
                "The bundling mechanism works as follows.",
                "Suppose the current price for 1 share of A is p1.",
                "A buyer agrees to purchase the share at p1.",
                "The buyer pays p1 dollars and receives p1 · 1A + P1 · 1A dollars.",
                "If there is enough inventory in the aftermarkets, the buyers share is constructed by bundling together p1 ·1A from the first aftermarket, and P1 ·1A from the second aftermarket.",
                "The seller in the first aftermarket receives p1MPr(A) dollars, and the seller in the second aftermarket receives p1MPr(B) dollars. 7.3 Pseudo aftermarket for DPM I There is an alternative pseudo aftermarket thats possible for the case of DPM I that does not require bundling.",
                "Consider a share of A purchased for $5.",
                "The share is composed of $5·1A and $P1 ·1A.",
                "Now suppose the current price has moved from $5 to $10 per share and the trader wants to cash out at a profit.",
                "The trader can sell 1/2 share at market price (1/2 share for $5), receiving all of the initial $5 investment back, and retaining 1/2 share of A.",
                "The 1/2 share is worth either some positive amount, or nothing, depending on the outcome and the final payoff.",
                "So the trader is left with shares worth a positive expected value and all of his or her initial investment.",
                "The trader has essentially cashed out and locked in his or her gains.",
                "Now suppose instead that the price moves downward, from $5 to $2 per share.",
                "The trader decides to limit his or her loss by selling the share for $2.",
                "The buyer gets the 1 share plus $2·1A (the buyers price refunded).",
                "The trader (seller) gets the $2 plus what remains of the original price refunded, or $3 · 1A.",

                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an <br>automated market maker</br> willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",

Desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo para la asignación de riesgos y especulación de información llamado mercado pari-mutuel dinámico (DPM). Un DPM actúa como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y una subasta doble continua (CDA), heredando algunas de las ventajas de ambos. Al igual que un mercado de pari-mutuel, un DPM ofrece liquidez infinita para la compra y cero riesgo para la institución del mercado; al igual que un CDA, un DPM puede reaccionar continuamente a nueva información, incorporar dinámicamente la información en los precios y permitir a los traders asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas vendiendo antes de la resolución del evento. La interfaz del operador puede ser diseñada para imitar el formato familiar de subasta doble con colas de oferta y demanda, aunque con una variable adicional llamada la ganancia por acción. La función de precio de DPM se puede ver como un <br>creador de mercado automatizado</br> que siempre ofrece vender a cierto precio, y ajusta el precio adecuadamente según la demanda. Dado que el mecanismo es de tipo pari-mutuel (es decir, redistributivo), se garantiza que pagará exactamente la cantidad de dinero recaudada. Exploro varias variaciones del DPM básico, analizando las propiedades de cada una y resolviendo en forma cerrada sus respectivas funciones de precio.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un <br>creador de mercado automatizado</br> siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un <br>creador de mercado automatizado</br> de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un <br>creador de mercado automatizado</br> de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un <br>creador de mercado automatizado</br> siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un <br>creador de mercado automatizado</br> dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la <br>demanda</br> de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una <br>demanda</br> neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM <br>price</br> function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some <br>price</br>, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective <br>price</br> functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some <br>price</br> automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the <br>price</br> for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its <br>price</br> increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its <br>price</br> decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a <br>price</br> function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The <br>price</br> function determines the instantaneous <br>price</br> per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the <br>price</br> is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the <br>price</br> is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid <br>price</br> of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask <br>price</br> of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid <br>price</br> is less than the lowest ask <br>price</br>, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid <br>price</br> and the lowest ask <br>price</br> may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some <br>price</br>.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un <br>precio</br> establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el <br>precio</br> de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su <br>precio</br> aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su <br>precio</br> disminuye. ",

                "A Dynamic Pari-Mutuel Market for Hedging, Wagering, and Information Aggregation David M. Pennock Yahoo!",
                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",
                "Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.",
                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",
                "Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B.",
                "There are many ways to formulate the price function.",
                "Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information.",
                "A standard pari-mutuel fails (3).",
                "A CDA fails (1).",
                "A CDAwMM, the bookmaker mechanism, and an MSR all fail (2).",
                "Even though technically an MSR exposes its patron to risk (i.e., a variable future payoff), the patrons maximum loss is bounded, so the distinction between a DPM and an MSR in terms of these three properties is more technical than practical.",
                "DPM traders can cash out of the market early, just like stock market traders, to lock in a profit or limit a loss, an action that is simply not possible in a standard pari-mutuel.",
                "A DPM also has some drawbacks.",
                "The payoff for a wager depends both on the price at the time of the trade, and on the final payoff per share at the markets close.",
                "This contrasts with the CDA variants, where the payoff vector across possible future outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade.",
                "So a traders strategic optimization problem is complicated by the need to predict the final values of P1 and P2.",
                "If P changes according to a random walk, then traders can take the current P as an unbiased estimate of the final P, greatly decreasing the complexity of their optimization.",

                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",

                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",

                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",

                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a bet is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",

                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",
                "Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B.",
                "There are many ways to formulate the price function.",
                "Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information.",

Un DPM actúa como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y una subasta doble continua (CDA), heredando algunas de las ventajas de ambos. Al igual que un mercado de pari-mutuel, un DPM ofrece liquidez infinita para la compra y cero riesgo para la institución del mercado; al igual que un CDA, un DPM puede reaccionar continuamente a nueva información, incorporar dinámicamente la información en los precios y permitir a los traders asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas vendiendo antes de la resolución del evento. La interfaz del operador puede ser diseñada para imitar el formato familiar de subasta doble con colas de oferta y demanda, aunque con una variable adicional llamada la ganancia por acción. La función de precio de DPM se puede ver como un creador de mercado automatizado que siempre ofrece vender a cierto precio, y ajusta el precio adecuadamente según la demanda. Dado que el mecanismo es de tipo pari-mutuel (es decir, redistributivo), se garantiza que pagará exactamente la cantidad de dinero recaudada.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la agregación continua de información. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o agregación de información es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",

                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and <br>information aggregation</br>.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",

                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",

                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la <br>agregación de información</br>. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden cubrir sus apuestas vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8. CONCLUSIONES He presentado un nuevo mecanismo de mercado para apostar o cubrirse contra un evento futuro incierto, llamado mercado parimutuel dinámico (DPM). El mecanismo combina la liquidez infinita y la naturaleza libre de riesgo de un mercado parimutuel con la naturaleza dinámica de un CDA, lo que lo hace adecuado para la <br>agregación continua de información</br>. Hasta donde sé, todos los mecanismos existentes, incluido el mercado estándar de apuestas mutuas, el CDA, el CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y el MSR, presentan como máximo dos de las tres propiedades. Un MSR es lo más parecido a un DPM en cuanto a estas propiedades, si no es en términos de mecánica. Dadas algunas restricciones naturales en la dinámica de precios, he derivado de forma cerrada las funciones de precios implícitas, las cuales codifican cómo los precios cambian continuamente a medida que se compran acciones. La interfaz para los traders se asemeja mucho a la conocida CDA, con el sistema actuando como un creador de mercado automatizado dispuesto a aceptar un número infinito de órdenes de compra a cierto precio. He explorado dos variaciones principales de un DPM: una donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido, y otra donde se redistribuye todo el dinero. Cada uno tiene sus propias ventajas y desventajas, y cada uno admite varias funciones de precios razonables. He descrito el funcionamiento de un mercado secundario, para que los comerciantes puedan retirarse del mercado temprano, como en un CDA, para asegurar sus ganancias o limitar sus pérdidas, una operación que no es posible en un entorno de apuestas mutuas estándar. 9. TRABAJO FUTURO Este artículo informa sobre los resultados de una investigación inicial del concepto de un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas. Muchas oportunidades para trabajos futuros se presentan, incluyendo la siguiente: • Conjetura de caminata aleatoria. La pregunta más importante en mi mente es si se puede demostrar la suposición de caminata aleatoria (3) bajo condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado y, si no es así, cómo afecta severamente la practicidad del sistema. • Análisis de incentivos. Formalmente, ¿cuáles son los incentivos para que los traders actúen sobre nueva información y cuándo lo hacen? ¿Cómo afecta el nivel de subsidio inicial los incentivos de los comerciantes? • Experimentos de laboratorio y pruebas de campo. Este documento se centró en las matemáticas y la algorítmica del mecanismo. Sin embargo, la verdadera prueba de la capacidad del mecanismo para servir como instrumento de cobertura, apuesta o <br>agregación de información</br> es probarlo con traders reales en un entorno realista. En realidad, ¿cómo se comportan las personas cuando se enfrentan a un mecanismo de DPM? • Mercado de llamadas de DPM. He derivado las funciones de precio para reaccionar a apuestas en un resultado a la vez. El mecanismo podría generalizarse para aceptar pedidos en ambos lados, luego actualizar los precios de manera integral, en lugar de asumir una secuencia particular en las apuestas. • Variables de valor real. Creo que los mecanismos en este documento pueden ser fácilmente generalizados a múltiples resultados discretos y múltiples resultados de valores reales que siempre suman un valor constante (por ejemplo, múltiples valores porcentuales que deben sumar 100). Sin embargo, la generalización a variables de valor real con un rango arbitrario es menos clara y está abierta para futuros desarrollos. • Apuestas compuestas/combinatorias. Creo que DPM puede ser adecuado para apuestas compuestas [8, 11] o combinatorias [2], por muchas de las mismas razones por las que las reglas de puntuación de mercado [11] son adecuadas para la tarea. DPM también puede tener algunas ventajas computacionales sobre MSR, aunque esto aún está por verse. Agradecimientos Agradezco a Dan Fain, Gary Flake, Lance Fortnow y Robin Hanson. 10.

                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",

Un DPM actúa como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y una subasta doble continua (CDA), heredando algunas de las ventajas de ambos. Al igual que un mercado de pari-mutuel, un DPM ofrece liquidez infinita para la compra y cero riesgo para la institución del mercado; al igual que un CDA, un DPM puede reaccionar continuamente a nueva información, incorporar dinámicamente la información en los precios y permitir a los traders asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas vendiendo antes de la resolución del evento. La interfaz del operador puede ser diseñada para imitar el formato familiar de subasta doble con colas de oferta y demanda, aunque con una variable adicional llamada la ganancia por acción. La función de precio de DPM se puede ver como un creador de mercado automatizado que siempre ofrece vender a cierto precio, y ajusta el precio adecuadamente según la demanda. Dado que el mecanismo es de tipo pari-mutuel (es decir, redistributivo), se garantiza que pagará exactamente la cantidad de dinero recaudada.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores cubrir riesgos o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como cobertura para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el <br>intercambio</br>. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una <br>operación</br> en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del <br>intercambio</br>, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del <br>intercambio</br> como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del <br>intercambio</br>, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del <br>intercambio</br>. ",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a bet on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always <br>hedge</br>-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who bet on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who bet on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is bet on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar bet in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to <br>hedge</br> risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a bet that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a <br>hedge</br> for a stockholder, is a bet that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",

                "The main disadvantage of refunding winning wagers is that shares are not homogenous: each share of A, for example, is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund, or a lottery ticket that pays $p if A occurs, where p is the price paid per share, and (2) one share of the final payoff ($P1) if A occurs.",

                "When all money is redistributed (DPM II), shares are homogeneous: each share entitles its owner to an equal slice of the final payoff.",
                "Because shares are homogenous, the implementation of an aftermarket is straightforward, as we shall see in Section 7.",
                "On the other hand, because initial prices paid are not refunded for winning bets, there is a chance that, if prices swing wildly enough, a wager on the correct outcome might actually lose money.",
                "Traders must be aware that if they buy in at an excessively high price that later tumbles allowing many others to get in at a much lower price, they may lose money in the end regardless of the outcome.",
                "From informal experiments, I dont believe this eventuality would be common, but nonetheless it requires care in communicating to traders the possible risks.",
                "One potential fix would be for the market maker to keep track of when the price is going too low, endangering an investor on the correct outcome.",
                "At this point, the market maker could artificially stop lowering the price.",
                "Sell orders in the aftermarket might still come in below the market makers price, but in this way the system could ensure that every wager on the correct outcome at least breaks even. 6.",

                "Even though the market makers price only rises, the going price may fall well below the market makers price, as ask orders are placed in the aftermarket.",

                "Each price function may have its own desirable properties, but its not clear which is best, or even that a single best method exists.",

                "AFTERMARKETS A key advantage of DPM over a standard pari-mutuel market is the ability to cash out of the market before it closes, in order to take a profit or limit a loss.",
                "This is accomplished by allowing traders to place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker.",
                "So traders can sell the shares that they purchased at or below the price set by the market maker.",

                "Buyers will purchase any existing shares for sale at the lower prices first, before purchasing new shares from the market maker. 7.1 Aftermarket for DPM II For the second main case explored above, where all money 177 is redistributed, allowing an aftermarket is simple.",
                "In fact, aftermarket may be a poor descriptor: buying and selling are both fully integrated into the same mechanism.",
                "Every share is worth precisely the same amount, so traders can simply place ask orders on the same queue as the market maker in order to sell their shares.",
                "New buyers will accept the lowest ask price, whether it comes from the market maker or another trader.",
                "In this way, traders can cash out early and walk away with their current profit or loss, assuming they can find a willing buyer. 7.2 Aftermarket for DPM I When winning wagers are refunded and only losing wagers are redistributed, each share is potentially worth a different amount, depending on how much was paid for it, so it is not as simple a matter to set up an aftermarket.",
                "However, an aftermarket is still possible.",
                "In fact, much of the complexity can be hidden from traders, so it looks nearly as simple as placing a sell order on the queue.",
                "In this case shares are not homogenous: each share of A is actually composed of two distinct parts: (1) the refund of p · 1A dollars, and (2) the payoff of P1 · 1A dollars, where p is the per-share price paid and 1A is the indicator function equalling 1 if A occurs, and 0 otherwise.",
                "One can imagine running two separate aftermarkets where people can sell these two respective components.",

Un DPM actúa como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y una subasta doble continua (CDA), heredando algunas de las ventajas de ambos. Al igual que un mercado de pari-mutuel, un DPM ofrece liquidez infinita para la compra y cero riesgo para la institución del mercado; al igual que un CDA, un DPM puede reaccionar continuamente a nueva información, incorporar dinámicamente la información en los precios y permitir a los traders asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas vendiendo antes de la resolución del evento. La interfaz del operador puede ser diseñada para imitar el formato familiar de subasta doble con colas de oferta y demanda, aunque con una variable adicional llamada la ganancia por acción. La función de precio de DPM se puede ver como un creador de mercado automatizado que siempre ofrece vender a cierto precio, y ajusta el precio adecuadamente según la demanda. Dado que el mecanismo es de tipo pari-mutuel (es decir, redistributivo), se garantiza que pagará exactamente la cantidad de dinero recaudada.

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden <br>cubrir</br> sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se apuestan M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada apuesta de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de apuestas mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la apuesta o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una apuesta temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de apuestas mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una apuesta de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar. Un CDAwMM también tiene liquidez incorporada, pero a costa de un riesgo significativo para el creador de mercado. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, dado que el dinero solo se redistribuye entre los apostadores, la institución del mercado en sí no tiene riesgo. La principal desventaja de un mercado de apuestas mutuas es que solo es útil para capturar el valor de un activo incierto en un momento específico en el tiempo. No es adecuado para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, actualizando continuamente el valor estimado del activo, situaciones comunes en la mayoría de los escenarios de comercio y apuestas. No existe la noción de comprar barato y vender caro, como ocurre en un CDA, donde comprar cuando pocos están comprando (y el precio es bajo) se recompensa más que comprar cuando muchos están comprando (y el precio es alto). Quizás por esta razón, en la mayoría de los entornos dinámicos, se emplean más comúnmente mecanismos financieros como el CDA que pueden reaccionar en tiempo real ante la información cambiante para facilitar la especulación y la cobertura. Dado que un mercado de apuestas mutuas puede estimar el valor de un activo en un solo instante en el tiempo, un mercado de apuestas mutuas repetido, donde se ejecutan mercados de apuestas mutuas distintos en intervalos consecutivos, en principio podría capturar la dinámica cambiante de la información. Pero llevar a cabo múltiples mercados consecutivos probablemente reduciría el volumen de operaciones en cada mercado individual. Además, en cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual, los incentivos seguirían siendo esperar para apostar hasta justo antes de la hora de cierre de ese mercado en particular. Este último problema podría ser mitigado mediante la institución de una regla de parada aleatoria para cada mercado de apuestas mutuas individual. En experimentos de laboratorio, los mercados de apuestas mutuas han demostrado una notable capacidad para agregar y difundir información dispersa entre los operadores, al menos para una única instantánea en el tiempo [17]. Una habilidad similar ha sido reconocida en autódromos reales [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Mercados financieros En el mundo financiero, apostar en los resultados de propuestas futuras inciertas también es común. El mecanismo de mercado típico utilizado es la subasta doble continua (CDA). El término mercado de valores en economía y finanzas engloba genéricamente una serie de mercados donde es posible especular sobre eventos inciertos. Ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como el NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como el CBOE, mercados de futuros como el CME, otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados políticos de valores, mercados de futuros de ideas, mercados de decisiones e incluso juegos de mercado. Los mercados de valores generalmente tienen un valor económico y social más allá de facilitar la especulación o las apuestas: permiten a los operadores <br>cubrir riesgos</br> o asegurarse contra resultados no deseados. Por lo tanto, si un resultado particular tiene desutilidad para un comerciante, él o ella puede mitigar el riesgo apostando por el resultado, para organizar una compensación en caso de que ocurra el resultado. En este sentido, comprar un seguro de automóvil es efectivamente una apuesta a que ocurrirá un accidente u otro evento cubierto. De manera similar, comprar una opción de venta, que es útil como <br>cobertura</br> para un accionista, es una apuesta a que el valor de la acción subyacente bajará. En la práctica, los agentes se dedican a una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre ambas [14]. Al igual que los mercados de apuestas mutuas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros son excelentes agregadores de información, generando pronósticos muy precisos de eventos futuros [5, 18, 19]. Un CDA constantemente empareja órdenes de compra de un activo con órdenes de venta. Si en algún momento una parte está dispuesta a comprar una unidad del activo a un precio de oferta pbid, mientras que otra parte está dispuesta a vender una unidad del activo a un precio de venta pask, y pbid es mayor o igual a pask, entonces las dos partes realizan una transacción (a algún precio entre pbid y pask). Si el precio de la oferta más alto es menor que el precio de la demanda más bajo, entonces no se producen transacciones. En un CDA, los precios de oferta y demanda cambian rápidamente a medida que llega nueva información y los traders reevalúan el valor del activo. Dado que el subastador solo empareja a postores dispuestos, el subastador no asume ningún riesgo. Sin embargo, los compradores solo pueden comprar tantas acciones como los vendedores estén dispuestos a vender; para que ocurra una transacción, debe haber una contraparte en el otro lado dispuesta a aceptar el intercambio. Como resultado, cuando pocos comerciantes participan en una CDA, esta puede volverse ilíquida, lo que significa que no ocurre mucha actividad comercial. La diferencia entre el precio de la oferta más alto y el precio de la demanda más bajo puede ser muy grande, o una o ambas colas pueden estar completamente vacías, desalentando el comercio. Una forma de inducir liquidez es proporcionar un creador de mercado que esté dispuesto a aceptar un gran número de órdenes de compra y venta a precios específicos. Llamamos a este mecanismo un CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). Conceptualmente, el creador de mercado es como cualquier otro operador, pero típicamente está dispuesto a aceptar un volumen mucho mayor de operaciones. El creador de mercado puede ser una persona o un algoritmo automatizado. Agregar un creador de mercado al sistema aumenta la liquidez, pero expone al creador de mercado al riesgo. Ahora, en lugar de solo igualar operaciones, el sistema realmente asume riesgos propios y, dependiendo de lo que suceda en el futuro, puede perder cantidades considerables de dinero. 2.3 Mercados de apuestas El típico corredor de apuestas u oddsmaker de Las Vegas funciona de manera muy similar a un creador de mercado en un CDA. En este caso, la institución del mercado (el libro o la casa) establece las probabilidades, inicialmente según la opinión de expertos, y más tarde en respuesta al nivel relativo de apuestas en los diferentes resultados. A diferencia de en un entorno de apuestas mutuas, cuando se realiza una apuesta con un corredor de apuestas, las probabilidades o términos de esa apuesta se fijan en el momento de la apuesta. El corredor de apuestas obtiene beneficios al ofrecer diferentes probabilidades para los dos lados de la apuesta, definiendo esencialmente un spread de oferta y demanda. Si bien las probabilidades pueden cambiar en respuesta a la información cambiante, cualquier apuesta realizada con probabilidades previamente establecidas sigue en efecto de acuerdo con las probabilidades en el momento de la apuesta; esto es precisamente en analogía con un CDAwMM. Una diferencia entre un corredor de apuestas y un creador de mercado es que el primero generalmente opera en un modo de \"tómalo o déjalo\": los apostadores no pueden colocar sus propias órdenes límite en una cola común, en efecto solo pueden realizar órdenes de mercado a precios definidos por el corredor de apuestas. Sin embargo, el corredor de apuestas ciertamente reacciona a la demanda de los apostadores. Como un creador de mercado, el corredor de apuestas se expone a un riesgo significativo. Los mercados de apuestas deportivas también han demostrado proporcionar pronósticos agregados de alta calidad [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Regla de puntuación de mercado La regla de puntuación de mercado (MSR) de Hanson [11] es un nuevo mecanismo para cobertura y especulación que comparte algunas propiedades en común con un DPM. Como un DPM, un MSR puede ser conceptualizado como un creador de mercado automatizado siempre dispuesto a aceptar una operación en cualquier evento a algún precio. Un MSR requiere que un cliente subsidie el mercado. La pérdida final de los clientes es variable, lo que técnicamente implica un grado de riesgo, aunque la pérdida máxima está limitada. Un MSR mantiene una distribución de probabilidad sobre todos los eventos. En cualquier momento, es común que ocurran 2 mercados delgados en la práctica, y se pueden ver en una variedad de los mercados menos populares disponibles en http://TradeSports.com, o en algunos mercados de opciones financieras, por ejemplo. Un ejemplo muy claro de un CDAwMM es el mercado interactivo de apuestas en http://WSEX.com. O, alternativamente, el corredor de apuestas establece la línea del juego para ofrecer probabilidades de dinero parejo. Un operador que cree que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución al aceptar un boleto de lotería que paga según una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [27], siempre y cuando ese operador también acepte pagar a la persona más reciente que cambió la distribución. En el límite de un único operador, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para sondear a un único agente sobre su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, se produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los posibles resultados, el mecanismo evita el problema de mercados poco líquidos o con poca liquidez. Un MSR no es de naturaleza pari-mutuel, ya que el cliente generalmente introduce una cantidad variable de dinero en el sistema. Un MSR proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de dos lados, mientras que un DPM proporciona un creador de mercado automatizado de un lado. En un MSR, el vector de pagos entre resultados está fijo en el momento del intercambio, mientras que en un DPM, el vector de pagos entre resultados depende tanto del estado de las apuestas en el momento del intercambio como del estado de las apuestas al cierre de los mercados. Si bien los mecanismos son bastante diferentes, y por lo tanto la aceptación del comerciante y los incentivos pueden diferir considerablemente, las propiedades y motivaciones de los DPM y los MSR son bastante similares. Hanson muestra cómo los MSR son especialmente adecuados para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El pago de los patrocinadores para subsidiar el comercio en todas las 2n posibles combinaciones de n eventos no es mayor que la suma de subsidiar los márgenes de los n eventos de forma independiente. El mecanismo estaba planeado para ser utilizado en el Mercado de Análisis de Políticas (PAM), un mercado de futuros en resultados relacionados con el Medio Oriente y financiado por DARPA, hasta que una tormenta mediática acabó con el proyecto. A la fecha de esta escritura, los fundadores de PAM estaban considerando reabrir bajo control privado. Un mercado dinámico de pari-mutuo 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel A diferencia de un mercado de pari-mutuo estándar, donde cada dólar siempre compra una participación igual en el pago, en un DPM cada dólar compra una participación variable en el pago dependiendo del estado de las apuestas en el momento de la compra. Por lo tanto, una apuesta por A en un momento en que la mayoría de los demás están apostando por B ofrece una mayor ganancia posible que una apuesta por A cuando la mayoría de los demás también están apostando por A. Una forma natural de comunicar el cambio en la ganancia de una apuesta es decir que, en cualquier momento dado, una cierta cantidad de dinero comprará un cierto número de acciones en un resultado u otro. La compra de una acción otorga a su propietario una participación igual en el bote ganador si se produce el resultado elegido. La ganancia es variable, porque cuando pocas personas están apostando por un resultado, las acciones generalmente serán más baratas que en un momento en que muchas personas están apostando por ese resultado. No hay un límite preestablecido en el número de acciones: nuevas acciones pueden generarse continuamente a medida que avanza el comercio. Para simplificar, todos los análisis en este documento consideran el caso de resultado binario; la generalización a múltiples resultados discretos debería ser sencilla. Denote los dos resultados A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos. Consulta http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html para obtener más información, o http://dpennock.com/pam.html para comentarios. Denote el precio instantáneo por acción de A como p1 y el precio por acción de B como p2. Denote los beneficios por acción como P1 y P2, respectivamente. Estos cuatro números, p1, p2, P1, P2, son los números clave que los traders deben seguir y entender. Ten en cuenta que el precio se establece en el momento de la apuesta; el pago por acción se finaliza solo después de que se revele el resultado del evento. En cualquier momento, un operador puede comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A a un precio p1 (y de manera similar para B). Sin embargo, dado que el precio cambia continuamente a medida que se compran acciones, el costo de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de una función de precio de 0 a n. El uso de funciones continuas e integrales puede ocultarse a los operadores al agregar las órdenes de venta de los creadores de mercado automatizados en lotes discretos de, digamos, 100 acciones cada uno. Estas órdenes de compra pueden ser introducidas automáticamente en el sistema por la institución del mercado, de modo que los operadores interactúen con lo que parece ser una CDA más familiar; examinamos este problema de interfaz con más detalle a continuación en la Sección 4.2. Para nuestro análisis, introducimos la siguiente notación adicional. Denote M1 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en A, M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en B, T = M1 + M2 como la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados, N1 como el número total de acciones compradas de A, y N2 como el número total de acciones compradas de B. Hay muchas formas de formular la función de precio. A continuación se describen varias funciones de precios naturales; cada una está motivada como la solución única a una restricción particular en la dinámica de precios. 3.2 Ventajas y desventajas Hasta donde yo sé, un DPM es el único mecanismo conocido para cobertura y especulación que exhibe las tres siguientes propiedades: (1) liquidez garantizada, (2) sin riesgo para la institución del mercado y (3) incorporación continua de información. Un pari-mutuel estándar falla (3). Un CDA falla. Un CDAwMM, el mecanismo de corredor de apuestas y un MSR fallan (2). Aunque técnicamente un MSR expone a su cliente al riesgo (es decir, a un pago futuro variable), la pérdida máxima del cliente está limitada, por lo que la distinción entre un DPM y un MSR en términos de estas tres propiedades es más técnica que práctica. Los operadores de DPM pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, al igual que los operadores del mercado de valores, para asegurar una ganancia o limitar una pérdida, una acción que simplemente no es posible en un sistema de apuestas mutuas estándar. Un DPM también tiene algunas desventajas. El pago de una apuesta depende tanto del precio en el momento del intercambio, como del pago final por acción al cierre de los mercados. Esto contrasta con las variantes de CDA, donde el vector de pagos entre posibles resultados futuros está fijo en el momento del intercambio. Por lo tanto, el problema de optimización estratégica de un trader se complica por la necesidad de predecir los valores finales de P1 y P2. Si P cambia de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio, entonces los traders pueden tomar el P actual como una estimación imparcial del P final, disminuyendo en gran medida la complejidad de su optimización. Si P no cambia según un paseo aleatorio, el mecanismo aún tiene utilidad como mecanismo para cobertura y especulación, aunque la optimización puede ser difícil y determinar una medida de la opinión agregada de los mercados sobre las probabilidades de A y B puede ser complicado. Discutimos las implicaciones del comportamiento de caminata aleatoria más adelante en la Sección 4.1 en la discusión en torno a la Suposición 3. Una segunda desventaja de un DPM es su naturaleza unilateral. Mientras que un creador de mercado automatizado siempre está listo para aceptar órdenes de compra, no hay un creador de mercado correspondiente para aceptar órdenes de venta. Los comerciantes deben venderse entre sí utilizando un mecanismo CDA estándar, por ejemplo, publicando una orden de venta a un precio igual o inferior al precio de venta actual del creador de mercado. Los comerciantes también pueden <br>cubrir sus apuestas</br> vendiendo al descubierto al comprar acciones en el resultado opuesto al del creador de mercado, de esta manera cubriendo su apuesta si no la liquidan por completo. 3.3 Regla de redistribución En un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar, los pagos se pueden calcular de dos maneras equivalentes: (1) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe un reembolso de los $1 iniciales pagados, más una parte igual de todas las apuestas perdedoras, o (2) cada apuesta ganadora de $1 recibe una parte igual de todas las apuestas, ganadoras o perdedoras. Debido a que cada dólar siempre gana una parte igual de la ganancia, las dos formulaciones son precisamente iguales: $1 + Mperder Mganar = Mganar + Mperder Mganar. En un mercado dinámico de apuestas mutuas, debido a que cada dólar no tiene el mismo peso, las dos formulaciones son distintas y conducen a funciones de precio y mecanismos significativamente diferentes, cada uno con propiedades potencialmente deseables diferentes. Consideramos cada caso en turno. La siguiente sección analiza el caso (1), donde solo se redistribuye el dinero perdido. La sección 5 examina el caso (2), donde todo el dinero es redistribuido. 4. DPM I: PERDIENDO DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO Para el caso en el que los pagos iniciales en las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsados, y solo el dinero perdido es redistribuido, las respectivas ganancias por acción son simplemente: P1 = M2 N1 P2 = M1 N2. Por lo tanto, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A reciben todo su pago inicial de vuelta, más P1 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de B pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B reciben de vuelta todo su pago inicial, más P2 dólares por acción poseída, mientras que los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. Sin pérdida de generalidad, analizaré el mercado desde la perspectiva de A, derivando precios y ganancias solo para A. Las ecuaciones para B son simétricas. El valor esperado por acción de los comerciantes para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1 donde E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[M2|N1] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1, siendo una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A, Pr(A) la creencia de los comerciantes en la probabilidad de A, y p1 el precio instantáneo por acción de A para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones. E[P1|A] es la expectativa del operador del pago por acción de A después de que el mercado cierre y dado que A ocurre. Este es un punto sutil. El valor de P1 no importa si ocurre B, ya que en este caso las acciones de A no tienen valor, y el valor actual de P1 no necesariamente importa ya que esto puede cambiar a medida que continúa el comercio. Por lo tanto, para determinar el valor esperado de las acciones de A, el operador debe estimar cuál espera que sea el pago por acción al final (después de que cierre el mercado) si A ocurre. Si E[acciones] / > 0, un trader neutral al riesgo debería comprar acciones de A. ¿Cuántas acciones? Esto depende de la función de precio que determina p1. En general, p1 aumenta a medida que se compran más acciones. El trader neutral al riesgo debería seguir comprando acciones hasta que E[acciones]/ = 0. (Un trader averso al riesgo generalmente dejará de comprar acciones antes de llevar E[acciones]/ a cero). Suponiendo neutralidad al riesgo, el problema de optimización de los traders es elegir un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A)·n·E[P1|A]−(1−Pr(A))· ∫ 0 n p1(n)dn. (1) Es fácil ver que el mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E [P1|A] − (1 − Pr(A)) · p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 4.1 Probabilidad de mercado. A medida que los operadores que creen que E[acciones de A]/ > 0 compran acciones de A y los operadores que creen que E[acciones de B]/ > 0 compran acciones de B, los precios p1 y p2 cambian de acuerdo con una función de precio, como se indica a continuación. Los precios actuales en cierto sentido reflejan la opinión del mercado en su totalidad sobre las probabilidades relativas de A y B. Suponiendo un mercado eficiente, el mercado en su conjunto considera que E[acciones]/ = 0, ya que el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero. Por ejemplo, si los participantes del mercado en conjunto sintieran que E[acciones] > 0, entonces habría una demanda neta de A, lo que elevaría el precio de A hasta que E[acciones] = 0. Define MPr(A) como la probabilidad de mercado de A, o la probabilidad de A inferida al asumir que E[acciones]/ = 0. Podemos considerar MPr(A) como la probabilidad agregada de A según lo evaluado por el mercado en su conjunto. MPr(A) es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − (1 − MPr(A)) · p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 p1 + E[P1|A] . (2) En este punto hacemos una suposición crítica para simplificar en gran medida el análisis; asumimos que E[P1|A] = P1. (3) Es decir, asumimos que el valor actual para el pago por acción de A es el mismo que el valor final esperado del pago por acción de A dado que A ocurre. Esto es ciertamente verdad para la última apuesta (infinitesimal) antes de que cierre el mercado. No es obvio, sin embargo, que la suposición sea cierta mucho antes de que cierren los mercados. Básicamente, estamos asumiendo que el valor de P1 se mueve de acuerdo con un paseo aleatorio no sesgado: el valor actual de P1 es la mejor expectativa de su valor futuro. Conjeturo que existen condiciones razonables de eficiencia de mercado bajo las cuales la suposición (3) es verdadera, aunque no he podido demostrar que surge naturalmente del trading racional. Examinamos los escenarios a continuación en los que la suposición (3) de 174 parece especialmente plausible. Sin embargo, la suposición afecta solo nuestro análisis. Independientemente de si (3) es verdadero, cada función de precio derivada a continuación implica un juego de suma cero bien definido en el que los operadores pueden participar. Si los comerciantes pueden asumir que (3) es verdadero, entonces su problema de optimización (1) se simplifica en gran medida; sin embargo, optimizar (1) no depende de la suposición, y los comerciantes aún pueden optimizar proyectando estratégicamente el pago final esperado de la manera complicada que deseen. Por lo tanto, la utilidad de DPM para cobertura y especulación no depende necesariamente de la veracidad de la suposición (3). Por otro lado, la capacidad de inferir fácilmente una probabilidad de consenso de mercado agregada a partir de los precios de mercado sí depende de (3). 4.2 Funciones de precio Una variedad de funciones de precio parecen razonables, cada una exhibiendo diversas propiedades e implicando probabilidades de mercado diferentes. 4.2.1 Función de precio I: Precio de A igual al pago de B Una función de precio natural a considerar es establecer el precio por acción de A igual al pago por acción de B, y establecer el precio por acción de B igual al pago por acción de A. Es decir, p1 = P2 p2 = P1. (4) Haciendo cumplir esta relación se reduce la dimensionalidad del sistema de cuatro a dos, simplificando la interfaz: los comerciantes solo necesitan hacer un seguimiento de dos números en lugar de cuatro. La relación tiene sentido, ya que nueva información que respalde a A debería fomentar la compra de acciones de A, aumentando tanto el precio de A como el beneficio de B, y disminuyendo el precio de B y el beneficio de A. En este contexto, la suposición (3) parece especialmente razonable, ya que si una hipótesis de mercado eficiente hace que los precios sigan un paseo aleatorio, entonces los pagos también deben seguir un paseo aleatorio. Las restricciones (4) conducen a la siguiente derivación de la probabilidad de mercado: MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)p1 MPr(A)P1 = MPr(B)P2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = P2 P1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 N2 M2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (5) Las restricciones (4) especifican la relación instantánea entre el pago y el precio. A partir de esto, podemos deducir cómo cambian los precios cuando se compran acciones (no infinitesimales). Sea n el número de acciones compradas y sea m la cantidad de dinero gastada comprando n acciones. Ten en cuenta que p1 = dm/dn, el precio instantáneo por acción, y m = R n 0 p1(n)dn. Sustituyendo en la ecuación (4), obtenemos: p1 = P2 dm dn = M1 + m N2 dm M1 + m = dn N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn N2 ln(M1 + m) = n N2 + C m = M1 h e n N2 − 1 i (6) La ecuación 6 da el costo de comprar n acciones. El precio instantáneo por acción como función de n es p1(n) = dm dn = M1 N2 e n N2. (7) Nótese que p1(0) = M1/N2 = P2 como se requiere. La derivación de la función de precio p2(n) para B es análoga y los resultados son simétricos. La noción de comprar acciones infinitesimales, o integrar costos sobre una función continua, probablemente sea ajena para la mayoría de los traders. Una interfaz más estándar puede ser implementada al discretizar los costos en lotes redondos de acciones, por ejemplo lotes de 100 acciones. Entonces, la institución de mercado puede colocar automáticamente órdenes de 100 acciones cada una al precio apropiado. Por ejemplo, la institución del mercado puede colocar una orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio m(100)/100, otra orden de venta por 100 acciones al precio (m(200)−m(100))/100, una tercera orden de venta por 100 acciones a (m(300)− m(200))/100, etc. De esta manera, el mercado se ve más familiar para los traders, como un CDA típico con una serie de órdenes de compra a diferentes precios disponibles automáticamente. Un operador que compre menos de 100 acciones pagaría un poco más que si el costo real se calculara utilizando (6), pero la interfaz discretizada probablemente sería más intuitiva y transparente para la mayoría de los operadores. Las ecuaciones anteriores asumen que todo el dinero que entra eventualmente es devuelto o redistribuido. En otras palabras, el mecanismo es un juego de suma cero, y la institución de mercado no recibe ninguna parte del dinero. Esto podría generalizarse de manera que la institución del mercado siempre tome una cierta cantidad, o un cierto porcentaje, o una cierta cantidad por transacción, o un cierto porcentaje por transacción, antes de devolver o redistribuir el dinero. Finalmente, cabe destacar que la función de precio anterior no está definida cuando la cantidad apostada o el número de acciones son cero. Entonces, el sistema debe comenzar con una cantidad positiva en ambos lados y con un número positivo de acciones en circulación en ambos lados. Estas cantidades iniciales pueden ser arbitrariamente pequeñas en principio, pero el tamaño del subsidio inicial puede afectar los incentivos de los comerciantes para participar. Además, cuanto menores sean las cantidades iniciales, más afecta cada nuevo dólar a los precios. Los montos de inicialización podrían ser financiados como una subvención de la institución de mercado o de un patrocinador, al que llamaré una apuesta inicial, o de una parte de las tarifas cobradas, a las que llamaré una apuesta inicial. 4.2.2 Función de precio II: Precio de A proporcional al dinero en A Una segunda función de precio se puede derivar al requerir que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1 p2 = M1 M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Esta parece ser una forma especialmente natural de establecer el precio, ya que a medida que más dinero se apuesta en un lado, más barata se vuelve una participación en el otro lado, en exactamente la misma proporción. Usando la Ecuación 8, junto con (2) y (3), podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · M2 N1 MPr(B) MPr(A) · M1 N2 = (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 · M2N2 M1N1 (MPr(A))2 (MPr(B))2 = (M1)2 N1 (M2)2N2 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 MPr(A) = M1 √ N1 M1 √ N1 + M2 √ N2 (9) Podemos resolver para el precio instantáneo de la siguiente manera: p1 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · P1 = M1 √ N1 M2 √ N2 · M2 N1 = M1 √ N1N2 (10) Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la función de costo implícita m como una función del número n de acciones compradas de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + m √ N1 + n √ N2 Z dm M1 + m = Z dn √ N1 + n √ N2 ln(M1 + m) = 2 N2 [(N1 + n)N2] 1 2 + C m = M1 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 − 1 # . (11) De esto obtenemos la función de precio: p1(n) = dm dn = M1 p (N1 + n)N2 e 2 r N1+n N2 −2 r N1 N2 . (12) Nota que, como se requiere, p1(0) = M1/ √ N1N2, y p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B, lo cual parece bastante natural. Ten en cuenta que, como antes, el mecanismo se puede modificar para recolectar tarifas de transacción de algún tipo. También tenga en cuenta que se requieren apuestas de semilla o iniciales para inicializar el sistema. 5. DPM II: TODO EL DINERO REDISTRIBUIDO. En el párrafo anterior examinamos la política de reembolsar las apuestas ganadoras y redistribuir solo las apuestas perdedoras. En esta sección consideramos la segunda política mencionada en la Sección 3.3: todo el dinero de todas las apuestas se recopila y se redistribuye a las apuestas ganadoras. Para el caso en el que todo el dinero se redistribuye, las ganancias respectivas por acción son: P1 = M1 + M2 N1 = T N1 P2 = M1 + M2 N2 = T N2, donde T = M1 + M2 es la cantidad total de dinero apostada en ambos lados. Entonces, si ocurre A, los accionistas de A pierden su precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P1 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de B simplemente pierden todo el dinero apostado. Del mismo modo, si ocurre B, los accionistas de B pierden el precio inicial pagado, pero reciben P2 dólares por acción poseída; los accionistas de A pierden todo el dinero apostado. En este caso, el valor esperado por acción de los traders para comprar una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones de A es E[acciones] = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Un trader neutral al riesgo optimiza eligiendo un número de acciones n ≥ 0 de A para comprar, con el fin de maximizar E[n acciones] = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − ∫ de 0 a n p1(n)dn = Pr(A) · n · E[P1|A] − m. El mismo valor de n se puede resolver encontrando el número de acciones necesario para llevar E[acciones] a cero. Es decir, encontrar n ≥ 0 que satisfaga 0 = Pr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1(n), si tal n existe, de lo contrario n = 0. 5.1 Probabilidad de mercado En este caso MPr(A), la probabilidad agregada de A según lo juzgado por el mercado en su totalidad, es la solución a 0 = MPr(A) · E[P1|A] − p1. Al resolver obtenemos MPr(A) = p1 E[P1|A] . (15) Como antes, hacemos la suposición simplificadora (3) de que la ganancia final esperada por acción es igual a la ganancia actual por acción. La suposición es crítica para nuestro análisis, pero puede que no sea necesaria para una implementación práctica. 5.2 Funciones de precio Para el caso en el que todo el dinero está distribuido, las restricciones (4) que mantienen el precio de A igual al pago de B, y viceversa, no conducen a la derivación de una función de precio coherente. Una función de precio razonable puede derivarse de la restricción (8) empleada en la Sección 4.2.2, donde requerimos que la proporción de precios sea igual a la proporción de dinero apostado. Es decir, p1/p2 = M1/M2. En otras palabras, el precio de A es proporcional a la cantidad de dinero apostado en A, y de manera similar para B. Utilizando las Ecuaciones 3, 8 y 15, podemos derivar la probabilidad de mercado implícita: M1 M2 = p1 p2 = MPr(A) MPr(B) · T N1 · N2 T = MPr(A) MPr(B) · N2 N1 MPr(A) MPr(B) = M1N1 M2N2 MPr(A) = M1N1 M1N1 + M2N2 (16) Curiosamente, esta es la misma probabilidad de mercado derivada en la Sección 4.2.1 para el caso de redistribución de dinero perdido con las restricciones de que el precio de A sea igual al pago de B y viceversa. El precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones es: p1 = (M1)2 + M1M2 M1N1 + M2N2 = M1 + M2 N1 + M2 M1 N2 Trabajando a partir del precio instantáneo anterior, podemos derivar la cantidad de acciones n que se pueden comprar por m dólares, de la siguiente manera: dm dn = M1 + M2 + m N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 dn dm = N1 + n + M2 M1+m N2 M1 + M2 + m (17) · · · n = m(N1 − N2) T + N2(T + m) M2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) . Ten en cuenta que resolvimos para n(m) en lugar de m(n). No pude encontrar una solución en forma cerrada para m(n), como se derivó para los otros dos casos anteriores. Sin embargo, n(m) se puede utilizar para determinar cuántas acciones se pueden comprar por m dólares, y la función inversa se puede aproximar numéricamente a cualquier grado. A partir de n(m) también podemos calcular la función de precio: p1(m) = dm dn = (M1 + m)M2T denom , (18) donde denom = (M1 + m)M2N1 + (M2 − m)M2N2 +T(M1 + m)N2 ln » T(M1 + m) M1(T + m) Nótese que, como se requiere, p1(0)/p2(0) = M1/M2. Si se utiliza la función de precio anterior, entonces la dinámica del mercado será tal que la proporción de los precios (instantáneos) de A y B siempre será igual a la proporción de las cantidades apostadas en A y B. Esta función de precio tiene otra propiedad deseable: actúa de tal manera que el valor esperado de apostar $1 en A y simultáneamente apostar $1 en B es igual a cero, asumiendo (3). Es decir, E[$1 de A + $1 de B] = 0. La derivación está omitida. 5.3 Comparación entre DPM I y II La principal ventaja de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras (DPM I) es que cada apuesta en el resultado ganador está garantizada al menos romper incluso. El principal inconveniente de reembolsar apuestas ganadoras es que las participaciones no son homogéneas: cada participación de A, por ejemplo, está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso, o un boleto de lotería que paga $p si A ocurre, donde p es el precio pagado por participación, y (2) una participación en el pago final ($P1) si A ocurre. Esto complica la implementación de un mercado secundario para retirarse del mercado temprano, lo cual examinaremos más adelante en la Sección 7. Cuando todo el dinero se redistribuye (DPM II), las acciones son homogéneas: cada acción otorga a su propietario una parte igual del pago final. Debido a que las acciones son homogéneas, la implementación de un mercado secundario es sencilla, como veremos en la Sección 7. Por otro lado, dado que los precios iniciales pagados no se reembolsan en apuestas ganadoras, existe la posibilidad de que, si los precios fluctúan lo suficiente, una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto pueda llegar a perder dinero en realidad. Los comerciantes deben ser conscientes de que si compran a un precio excesivamente alto que luego cae permitiendo que muchos otros compren a un precio mucho más bajo, pueden perder dinero al final, independientemente del resultado. A partir de experimentos informales, no creo que esta eventualidad sea común, pero de todas formas requiere cuidado al comunicar a los comerciantes los posibles riesgos. Una posible solución sería que el creador de mercado lleve un registro de cuándo el precio está bajando demasiado, poniendo en peligro a un inversor en el resultado correcto. En este punto, el creador de mercado podría detener artificialmente la disminución del precio. Las órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario podrían seguir llegando por debajo del precio del creador de mercado, pero de esta manera el sistema podría garantizar que cada apuesta en el resultado correcto al menos se recupere. 6. OTRAS VARIACIONES Una función de precio simple y ascendente establecería p1 = αM1 y p2 = αM2, donde α > 0. En este caso, los precios solo subirían. En el caso de que todo el dinero sea redistribuido, esto eliminaría la posibilidad de perder dinero en una apuesta sobre el resultado correcto. Aunque el precio de los creadores de mercado solo suba, el precio de venta puede caer por debajo del precio de los creadores de mercado, ya que se colocan órdenes de venta en el mercado secundario. He derivado funciones de precio para varios otros casos, utilizando la misma metodología anterior. Cada función de precio puede tener sus propiedades deseables, pero no está claro cuál es la mejor, o incluso si existe un único mejor método. Se requieren análisis adicionales y, más importante aún, investigaciones empíricas para responder a estas preguntas. Una ventaja clave de DPM sobre un mercado de apuestas mutuas estándar es la capacidad de retirarse del mercado antes de que cierre, con el fin de obtener ganancias o limitar pérdidas. Esto se logra permitiendo a los operadores colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado. Así los comerciantes pueden vender las acciones que compraron al precio establecido por el creador de mercado o por debajo de este. O los traders pueden colocar una orden de venta con límite a cualquier precio. Los compradores comprarán cualquier acción existente en venta a precios más bajos primero, antes de comprar nuevas acciones al creador de mercado. 7.1 Mercado secundario para DPM II Para el segundo caso principal explorado anteriormente, donde todo el dinero 177 se redistribuye, permitir un mercado secundario es simple. De hecho, \"posventa\" puede ser un mal descriptor: la compra y venta están completamente integradas en el mismo mecanismo. Cada acción tiene exactamente el mismo valor, por lo que los operadores pueden simplemente colocar órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado para vender sus acciones. Los nuevos compradores aceptarán el precio de venta más bajo, ya sea que provenga del creador de mercado o de otro operador. De esta manera, los operadores pueden cobrar temprano y retirarse con su ganancia o pérdida actual, siempre y cuando puedan encontrar un comprador dispuesto. 7.2 Mercado secundario para DPM I Cuando las apuestas ganadoras son reembolsadas y solo las perdedoras son redistribuidas, cada acción potencialmente vale una cantidad diferente, dependiendo de cuánto se pagó por ella, por lo que no es tan simple establecer un mercado secundario. Sin embargo, todavía es posible un mercado secundario. De hecho, gran parte de la complejidad puede ocultarse a los operadores, por lo que parece casi tan simple como colocar una orden de venta en la cola. En este caso, las acciones no son homogéneas: cada acción de A está compuesta en realidad por dos partes distintas: (1) el reembolso de p · 1A dólares, y (2) el pago de P1 · 1A dólares, donde p es el precio por acción pagado y 1A es la función indicadora que es igual a 1 si A ocurre, y 0 en caso contrario. Se puede imaginar la gestión de dos mercados secundarios separados donde la gente pueda vender estos dos componentes respectivos. Sin embargo, es posible automatizar los dos mercados secundarios, agrupándolos automáticamente en la proporción correcta y vendiéndolos en el DPM central. De esta manera, los operadores pueden retirar efectivo colocando órdenes de venta en la misma cola que el creador de mercado DPM, ocultando efectivamente la complejidad de tener explícitamente dos mercados secundarios separados. El mecanismo de agrupación funciona de la siguiente manera. Supongamos que el precio actual de 1 acción de A es p1. Un comprador acepta comprar la acción a p1. El comprador paga p1 dólares y recibe p1 · 1A + p1 · 1A dólares. Si hay suficiente inventario en los mercados secundarios, la participación de los compradores se construye agrupando juntos p1 ·1A del primer mercado secundario, y P1 ·1A del segundo mercado secundario. El vendedor en el primer mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(A) dólares, y el vendedor en el segundo mercado secundario recibe p1MPr(B) dólares. 7.3 Pseudo mercado secundario para DPM I Existe un pseudo mercado secundario alternativo que es posible para el caso de DPM I y que no requiere agrupación. Considera una acción de A comprada por $5. La participación está compuesta por $5·1A y $P1 ·1A. Ahora supongamos que el precio actual ha subido de $5 a $10 por acción y el trader quiere vender para obtener ganancias. El comerciante puede vender 1/2 acción al precio de mercado (1/2 acción por $5), recuperando toda la inversión inicial de $5 y conservando 1/2 acción de A. La participación de 1/2 vale ya sea una cantidad positiva, o nada, dependiendo del resultado y el pago final. Así que el comerciante se queda con acciones que valen un valor esperado positivo y toda su inversión inicial. El comerciante ha básicamente cobrado y asegurado sus ganancias. Ahora supongamos en cambio que el precio se mueve hacia abajo, de $5 a $2 por acción. El comerciante decide limitar su pérdida vendiendo la acción por $2. El comprador recibe la 1 acción más $2·1A (el precio del comprador reembolsado). El comerciante (vendedor) recibe los $2 más lo que queda del precio original reembolsado, o $3 · 1A. La pérdida del comerciante ahora está limitada a $3 como máximo en lugar de $5. Si ocurre A, el comerciante recupera su inversión; si ocurre B, el comerciante pierde $3. También hay que tener en cuenta que, en cualquiera de las formulaciones de DPM, los operadores siempre pueden cubrir una venta comprando el resultado opuesto sin necesidad de ningún tipo de mercado secundario. 8.

                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are bet on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who bet on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money bet on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",

                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular bet, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to bet early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their bet, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to bet until just before the ending time of that particular market.",

                "Research Labs 74 N. Pasadena Ave, 3rd Floor Pasadena, CA 91103 USA pennockd@yahoo-inc.com ABSTRACT I develop a new mechanism for risk allocation and information speculation called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM acts as hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a continuous double auction (CDA), inheriting some of the advantages of both.",
                "Like a pari-mutuel market, a DPM offers infinite buy-in liquidity and zero risk for the market institution; like a CDA, a DPM can continuously react to new information, dynamically incorporate information into prices, and allow traders to lock in gains or limit losses by selling prior to event resolution.",
                "The trader interface can be designed to mimic the familiar double auction format with bid-ask queues, though with an addition variable called the payoff per share.",
                "The DPM price function can be viewed as an automated market maker always offering to sell at some price, and moving the price appropriately according to demand.",
                "Since the mechanism is pari-mutuel (i.e., redistributive), it is guaranteed to pay out exactly the amount of money taken in.",
                "I explore a number of variations on the basic DPM, analyzing the properties of each, and solving in closed form for their respective price functions.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Design, Economics, Theory. 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION A wide variety of financial and wagering mechanisms have been developed to support hedging (i.e., insuring) against exposure to uncertain events and/or speculative trading on uncertain events.",
                "The dominant mechanism used in financial circles is the continuous double auction (CDA), or in some cases the CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).",
                "The primary mechanism used for sports wagering is a bookie or bookmaker, who essentially acts exactly as a market maker.",
                "Horse racing and jai alai wagering traditionally employ the pari-mutuel mechanism.",
                "Though there is no formal or logical separation between financial trading and wagering, the two endeavors are socially considered distinct.",
                "Recently, there has been a move to employ CDAs or CDAwMMs for all types of wagering, including on sports, horse racing, political events, world news, and many other uncertain events, and a simultaneous and opposite trend to use bookie systems for betting on financial markets.",
                "These trends highlight the interchangeable nature of the mechanisms and further blur the line between investing and betting.",
                "Some companies at the forefront of these movements are growing exponentially, with some industry observers declaring the onset of a revolution in the wagering business.1 Each mechanism has pros and cons for the market institution and the participating traders.",
                "A CDA only matches willing traders, and so poses no risk whatsoever for the market institution.",
                "But a CDA can suffer from illiquidity in the form huge bid-ask spreads or even empty bid-ask queues if trading is light and thus markets are thin.",
                "A successful CDA must overcome a chicken-and-egg problem: traders are attracted to liquid markets, but liquid markets require a large number of traders.",
                "A CDAwMM and the similar bookie mechanism have built-in liquidity, but at a cost: the market maker itself, usually affiliated with the market institution, is exposed to significant risk of large monetary losses.",
                "Both the CDA and CDAwMM offer incentives for traders to leverage information continuously as soon as that information becomes available.",
                "As a result, prices are known to capture the current state of information exceptionally well.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets effectively have infinite liquidity: anyone can place a <br>bet</br> on any outcome at any time, without the need for a matching offer from another bettor or a market maker.",
                "Pari-mutuel markets also involve no risk for the market institution, since they only redistribute money from losing wagers to winning wagers.",
                "However, pari-mutuel mar1 http://www.wired.com/news/ebiz/0,1272,61051,00.html 170 kets are not suitable for situations where information arrives over time, since there is a strong disincentive for placing bets until either (1) all information is revealed, or (2) the market is about to close.",
                "For this reason, pari-mutuel prices prior to the markets close cannot be considered a reflection of current information.",
                "Pari-mutuel market participants cannot buy low and sell high: they cannot cash out gains (or limit losses) before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "Because the process whereby information arrives continuously over time is the rule rather than the exception, the applicability of the standard pari-mutuel mechanism is questionable in a large number of settings.",
                "In this paper, I develop a new mechanism suitable for hedging, speculating, and wagering, called a dynamic parimutuel market (DPM).",
                "A DPM can be thought of as a hybrid between a pari-mutuel market and a CDA.",
                "A DPM is indeed pari-mutuel in nature, meaning that it acts only to redistribute money from some traders to others, and so exposes the market institution to no volatility (no risk).",
                "A constant, pre-determined subsidy is required to start the market.",
                "The subsidy can in principle be arbitrarily small and might conceivably come from traders (via antes or transaction fees) rather than the market institution, though a nontrivial outside subsidy may actually encourage trading and information aggregation.",
                "A DPM has the infinite liquidity of a pari-mutuel market: traders can always purchase shares in any outcome at any time, at some price automatically set by the market institution.",
                "A DPM is also able to react to and incorporate information arriving over time, like a CDA.",
                "The market institution changes the price for particular outcomes based on the current state of wagering.",
                "If a particular outcome receives a relatively large number of wagers, its price increases; if an outcome receives relatively few wagers, its price decreases.",
                "Prices are computed automatically using a price function, which can differ depending on what properties are desired.",
                "The price function determines the instantaneous price per share for an infinitesimal quantity of shares; the total cost for purchasing n shares is computed as the integral of the price function from 0 to n. The complexity of the price function can be hidden from traders by communicating only the ask prices for various lots of shares (e.g., lots of 100 shares), as is common practice in CDAs and CDAwMMs.",
                "DPM prices do reflect current information, and traders can cash out in an aftermarket to lock in gains or limit losses before the event outcome is revealed.",
                "While there is always a market maker willing to accept buy orders, there is not a market maker accepting sell orders, and thus no guaranteed liquidity for selling: instead, selling is accomplished via a standard CDA mechanism.",
                "Traders can always hedge-sell by purchasing the opposite outcome than they already own. 2.",
                "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK 2.1 Pari-mutuel markets Pari-mutuel markets are common at horse races [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], dog races, and jai alai games.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market people place wagers on which of two or more mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes will occur at some time in the future.",
                "After the true outcome becomes known, all of the money that is lost by those who <br>bet</br> on the incorrect outcome is redistributed to those who <br>bet</br> on the correct outcome, in direct proportion to the amount they wagered.",
                "More formally, if there are k mutually exclusive and exhaustive outcomes (e.g., k horses, exactly one of which will win), and M1, M2, . . . , Mk dollars are <br>bet</br> on each outcome, and outcome i occurs, then everyone who <br>bet</br> on an outcome j = i loses their wager, while everyone who bet on outcome i receives Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dollars for every dollar they wagered.",
                "That is, every dollar wagered on i receives an equal share of all money wagered.",
                "An equivalent way to think about the redistribution rule is that every dollar wagered on i is refunded, then receives an equal share of all remaining money <br>bet</br> on the losing outcomes, or P j=i Mj/Mi dollars.",
                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount <br>bet</br>.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, meaning that Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 and Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1.",
                "Suppose $800 is <br>bet</br> on A and $200 on B.",
                "Now suppose that A occurs (e.g., horse A wins the race).",
                "People who wagered on B lose their money, or $200 in total.",
                "People who wagered on A win and each receives a proportional share of the total $1000 wagered (ignoring fees).",
                "Specifically, each $1 wager on A entitles its owner a 1/800 share of the $1000, or $1.25.",
                "Every dollar <br>bet</br> in a pari-mutuel market has an equal payoff, regardless of when the wager was placed or how much money was invested in the various outcomes at the time the wager was placed.",
                "The only state that matters is the final state: the final amounts wagered on all the outcomes when the market closes, and the identity of the correct outcome.",
                "As a result, there is a disincentive to place a wager early if there is any chance that new information might become available.",
                "Moreover, there are no guarantees about the payoff rate of a particular <br>bet</br>, except that it will be nonnegative if the correct outcome is chosen.",
                "Payoff rates can fluctuate arbitrarily until the market closes.",
                "So a second reason not to <br>bet</br> early is to wait to get a better sense of the final payout rates.",
                "This is in contrast to CDAs and CDAwMMs, like the stock market, where incentives exist to invest as soon as new information is revealed.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors may be allowed to switch their chosen outcome, or even cancel their <br>bet</br>, prior to the markets close.",
                "However, they cannot cash out of the market early, to either lock in gains or limit losses, if new information favors one outcome over another, as is possible in a CDA or a CDAwMM.",
                "If bettors can cancel or change their bets, then an aftermarket to sell existing wagers is not sensible: every dollar wagered is worth exactly $1 up until the markets close-no one would buy at greater than $1 and no one would sell at less than $1.",
                "Pari-mutuel bettors must wait until the outcome is revealed to realize any profit or loss.",
                "Unlike a CDA, in a pari-mutuel market, anyone can place a wager of any amount at any time-there is in a sense infinite liquidity for buying.",
                "A CDAwMM also has built-in liquidity, but at the cost of significant risk for the market maker.",
                "In a pari-mutuel market, since money is only redistributed among bettors, the market institution itself has no risk.",
                "The main drawback of a pari-mutuel market is that it is useful only for capturing the value of an uncertain asset at some instant in time.",
                "It is ill-suited for situations where information arrives over time, continuously updating the estimated value of the asset-situations common in al171 most all trading and wagering scenarios.",
                "There is no notion of buying low and selling high, as occurs in a CDA, where buying when few others are buying (and the price is low) is rewarded more than buying when many others are buying (and the price is high).",
                "Perhaps for this reason, in most dynamic environments, financial mechanisms like the CDA that can react in real-time to changing information are more typically employed to facilitate speculating and hedging.",
                "Since a pari-mutuel market can estimate the value of an asset at a single instant in time, a repeated pari-mutuel market, where distinct pari-mutuel markets are run at consecutive intervals, could in principle capture changing information dynamics.",
                "But running multiple consecutive markets would likely thin out trading in each individual market.",
                "Also, in each individual pari-mutuel market, the incentives would still be to wait to <br>bet</br> until just before the ending time of that particular market.",
                "This last problem might be mitigated by instituting a random stopping rule for each individual pari-mutuel market.",
                "In laboratory experiments, pari-mutuel markets have shown a remarkable ability to aggregate and disseminate information dispersed among traders, at least for a single snapshot in time [17].",
                "A similar ability has been recognized at real racetracks [1, 22, 24, 25, 26]. 2.2 Financial markets In the financial world, wagering on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions is also common.",
                "The typical market mechanism used is the continuous double auction (CDA).",
                "The term securities market in economics and finance generically encompasses a number of markets where speculating on uncertain events is possible.",
                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like the CBOE [13], futures markets like the CME [21], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [6, 7], idea futures markets [12], decision markets [10] and even market games [3, 15, 16].",
                "Securities markets generally have an economic and social value beyond facilitating speculation or wagering: they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "So if a particular outcome has disutility for a trader, he or she can mitigate the risk by wagering for the outcome, to arrange for compensation in case the outcome occurs.",
                "In this sense, buying automobile insurance is effectively a <br>bet</br> that an accident or other covered event will occur.",
                "Similarly, buying a put option, which is useful as a hedge for a stockholder, is a <br>bet</br> that the underlying stock will go down.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [14].",
                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",
                "A CDA constantly matches orders to buy an asset with orders to sell.",
                "If at any time one party is willing to buy one unit of the asset at a bid price of pbid, while another party is willing to sell one unit of the asset at an ask price of pask, and pbid is greater than or equal to pask, then the two parties transact (at some price between pbid and pask).",
                "If the highest bid price is less than the lowest ask price, then no transactions occur.",
                "In a CDA, the bid and ask prices rapidly change as new information arrives and traders reassess the value of the asset.",
                "Since the auctioneer only matches willing bidders, the auctioneer takes on no risk.",
                "However, buyers can only buy as many shares as sellers are willing to sell; for any transaction to occur, there must be a counterparty on the other side willing to accept the trade.",
                "As a result, when few traders participate in a CDA, it may become illiquid, meaning that not much trading activity occurs.",
                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",
                "We call this mechanism a CDA with market maker (CDAwMM).3 Conceptually, the market maker is just like any other trader, but typically is willing to accept a much larger volume of trades.",
                "The market maker may be a person, or may be an automated algorithm.",
                "Adding a market maker to the system increases liquidity, but exposes the market maker to risk.",
                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that <br>bet</br> are fixed at the time of the <br>bet</br>.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the <br>bet</br>, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the <br>bet</br>; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",
                "Like a DPM, an MSR can be conceptualized as an automated market maker always willing to accept a trade on any event at some price.",
                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",
                "A DYNAMIC PARI-MUTUEL MARKET 3.1 High-level description In contrast to a standard pari-mutuel market, where each dollar always buys an equal share of the payoff, in a DPM each dollar buys a variable share in the payoff depending on the state of wagering at the time of purchase.",
                "So a wager on A at a time when most others are wagering on B offers a greater possible profit than a wager on A when most others are also wagering on A.",
                "A natural way to communicate the changing payoff of a <br>bet</br> is to say that, at any given time, a certain amount of money will buy a certain number of shares in one outcome the other.",
                "Purchasing a share entitles its owner to an equal stake in the winning pot should the chosen outcome occur.",
                "The payoff is variable, because when few people are betting on an outcome, shares will generally be cheaper than at a time when many people are betting that outcome.",
                "There is no pre-determined limit on the number of shares: new shares can be continually generated as trading proceeds.",
                "For simplicity, all analyses in this paper consider the binary outcome case; generalizing to multiple discrete outcomes should be straightforward.",
                "Denote the two outcomes A and B.",
                "The outcomes are mutually exclusive and ex5 See http://hanson.gmu.edu/policyanalysismarket.html for more information, or http://dpennock.com/pam.html for commentary. 6 http://www.policyanalysismarket.com/ haustive.",
                "Denote the instantaneous price per share of A as p1 and the price per share of B as p2.",
                "Denote the payoffs per share as P1 and P2, respectively.",
                "These four numbers, p1, p2, P1, P2 are the key numbers that traders must track and understand.",
                "Note that the price is set at the time of the wager; the payoff per share is finalized only after the event outcome is revealed.",
                "At any time, a trader can purchase an infinitesimal quantity of shares of A at price p1 (and similarly for B).",
                "However, since the price changes continuously as shares are purchased, the cost of buying n shares is computed as the integral of a price function from 0 to n. The use of continuous functions and integrals can be hidden from traders by aggregating the automated market makers sell orders into discrete lots of, say, 100 shares each.",
                "These ask orders can be automatically entered into the system by the market institution, so that traders interact with what looks like a more familiar CDA; we examine this interface issue in more detail below in Section 4.2.",
                "For our analysis, we introduce the following additional notation.",
                "Denote M1 as the total amount of money wagered on A, M2 as the total amount of money wagered on B, T = M1 + M2 as the total amount of money wagered on both sides, N1 as the total number of shares purchased of A, and N2 as the total number of shares purchased of B.",
                "There are many ways to formulate the price function.",
                "Several natural price functions are outlined below; each is motivated as the unique solution to a particular constraint on price dynamics. 3.2 Advantages and disadvantages To my knowledge, a DPM is the only known mechanism for hedging and speculating that exhibits all three of the following properties: (1) guaranteed liquidity, (2) no risk for the market institution, and (3) continuous incorporation of information.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de <br>apuesta</br>s mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una <br>apuesta</br> en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que <br>apostaron</br> por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que <br>apostaron</br> por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se <br>apuestan</br> M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su apuesta, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar <br>apostado</br> en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante <br>apostado</br> en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad <br>apostada</br>.

                "In practice, the market institution (e.g., the racetrack) first takes a certain percent of the total amount wagered, usually about 20% in the United States, then redistributes whatever money remains to the winners in proportion to their amount bet.",
                "Consider a simple example with two outcomes, A and B.",

                "Like pari-mutuel markets, often prices in financial markets are excellent information aggregators, yielding very accurate forecasts of future events [5, 18, 19].",

                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",

                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a <br>wager</br> is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",

                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",

                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",
                "While the mechanisms are quite different-and so trader acceptance and incentives may strongly differ-the properties and motivations of DPMs and MSRs are quite similar.",
                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Se han desarrollado una amplia variedad de mecanismos financieros y de apuestas para respaldar la cobertura (es decir, el seguro) contra la exposición a eventos inciertos y/o operaciones especulativas en eventos inciertos. El mecanismo dominante utilizado en círculos financieros es la subasta doble continua (CDA), o en algunos casos la CDA con creador de mercado (CDAwMM). El mecanismo principal utilizado para las apuestas deportivas es un corredor de apuestas o apostador, que actúa esencialmente como un creador de mercado. Las carreras de caballos y las apuestas de jai alai tradicionalmente emplean el mecanismo de apuestas mutuas. Aunque no existe una separación formal o lógica entre el comercio financiero y las apuestas, ambos emprendimientos son considerados socialmente distintos. Recientemente, ha habido un movimiento para emplear CDAs o CDAwMMs para todo tipo de apuestas, incluyendo en deportes, carreras de caballos, eventos políticos, noticias mundiales y muchos otros eventos inciertos, y una tendencia simultánea y opuesta a utilizar sistemas de corredores de apuestas para apostar en los mercados financieros. Estas tendencias resaltan la naturaleza intercambiable de los mecanismos y difuminan aún más la línea entre invertir y apostar. Algunas empresas a la vanguardia de estos movimientos están creciendo exponencialmente, con algunos observadores de la industria declarando el inicio de una revolución en el negocio de las apuestas. Cada mecanismo tiene pros y contras para la institución del mercado y los traders participantes. Un CDA solo empareja a comerciantes dispuestos, por lo que no representa ningún riesgo para la institución del mercado. Pero un CDA puede sufrir de falta de liquidez en forma de grandes diferencias entre la oferta y la demanda, o incluso colas vacías de oferta y demanda si la negociación es escasa y, por lo tanto, los mercados son delgados. Un CDA exitoso debe superar un problema de huevo y gallina: los comerciantes son atraídos por los mercados líquidos, pero los mercados líquidos requieren un gran número de comerciantes. Un CDAwMM y el mecanismo similar de bookie tienen liquidez incorporada, pero a un costo: el creador de mercado en sí, generalmente afiliado a la institución del mercado, está expuesto a un riesgo significativo de grandes pérdidas monetarias. Tanto el CDA como el CDAwMM ofrecen incentivos a los comerciantes para aprovechar la información de forma continua tan pronto como esté disponible. Como resultado, se sabe que los precios capturan de manera excepcional el estado actual de la información. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas tienen una liquidez efectivamente infinita: cualquiera puede hacer una apuesta en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, sin necesidad de una oferta coincidente de otro apostador o un creador de mercado. Los mercados de apuestas mutuas también no implican riesgo alguno para la institución del mercado, ya que solo redistribuyen dinero de las apuestas perdedoras a las ganadoras. Sin embargo, las apuestas mutuas no son adecuadas para situaciones en las que la información llega con el tiempo, ya que existe un fuerte desincentivo para realizar apuestas hasta que se revele toda la información o el mercado esté a punto de cerrar. Por esta razón, los precios de la apuesta mutua antes de que cierren los mercados no pueden considerarse un reflejo de la información actual. Los participantes del mercado de apuestas mutuas no pueden comprar barato y vender caro: no pueden cobrar ganancias (o limitar pérdidas) antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Dado que el proceso por el cual la información llega continuamente con el tiempo es la regla en lugar de la excepción, la aplicabilidad del mecanismo estándar de pari-mutuel es cuestionable en un gran número de contextos. En este artículo, desarrollo un nuevo mecanismo adecuado para cobertura, especulación y apuestas, llamado mercado parimutuo dinámico (DPM). Un DPM puede ser considerado como un híbrido entre un mercado de apuestas mutuas y un CDA. Un DPM es de hecho de naturaleza pari-mutua, lo que significa que actúa solo para redistribuir dinero de algunos operadores a otros, y por lo tanto expone a la institución del mercado a ninguna volatilidad (sin riesgo). Se requiere un subsidio constante y preestablecido para iniciar el mercado. El subsidio en principio puede ser arbitrariamente pequeño y posiblemente provenga de los comerciantes (a través de apuestas o tarifas de transacción) en lugar de la institución del mercado, aunque un subsidio externo no trivial podría fomentar el comercio y la agregación de información. Un DPM tiene la liquidez infinita de un mercado de apuestas mutuas: los operadores siempre pueden comprar acciones en cualquier resultado en cualquier momento, a un precio establecido automáticamente por la institución del mercado. Un DPM también es capaz de reaccionar e incorporar información que llega con el tiempo, al igual que un CDA. La institución del mercado cambia el precio de resultados particulares basándose en el estado actual de las apuestas. Si un resultado en particular recibe un número relativamente grande de apuestas, su precio aumenta; si un resultado recibe relativamente pocas apuestas, su precio disminuye. Los precios se calculan automáticamente utilizando una función de precios, la cual puede variar dependiendo de las propiedades deseadas. La función de precio determina el precio instantáneo por acción para una cantidad infinitesimal de acciones; el costo total de comprar n acciones se calcula como la integral de la función de precio de 0 a n. La complejidad de la función de precio puede ocultarse a los operadores al comunicar solo los precios de oferta para varios lotes de acciones (por ejemplo, lotes de 100 acciones), como es práctica común en CDAs y CDAwMMs. Los precios de DPM reflejan la información actual, y los operadores pueden obtener efectivo en un mercado secundario para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas antes de que se revele el resultado del evento. Siempre hay un creador de mercado dispuesto a aceptar órdenes de compra, pero no hay un creador de mercado que acepte órdenes de venta, por lo que no hay liquidez garantizada para vender: en su lugar, la venta se realiza a través de un mecanismo CDA estándar. Los comerciantes siempre pueden cubrir sus ventas comprando el resultado opuesto al que ya poseen. ANTECEDENTES Y TRABAJO RELACIONADO 2.1 Mercados de apuestas mutuas Los mercados de apuestas mutuas son comunes en carreras de caballos [1, 22, 24, 25, 26], carreras de perros y juegos de jai alai. En un mercado de apuestas mutuas, las personas realizan apuestas sobre cuál de dos o más resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ocurrirá en algún momento en el futuro. Después de que se conozca el resultado real, todo el dinero perdido por aquellos que apostaron por el resultado incorrecto se redistribuye a aquellos que apostaron por el resultado correcto, en proporción directa a la cantidad apostada. Más formalmente, si hay k resultados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos (por ejemplo, k caballos, de los cuales exactamente uno ganará), y se <br>apuesta</br>n M1, M2, . . . , Mk dólares en cada resultado, y ocurre el resultado i, entonces todos los que apostaron por un resultado j = i pierden su <br>apuesta</br>, mientras que todos los que apostaron por el resultado i reciben Pk j=1 Mj/Mi dólares por cada dólar apostado. Es decir, cada dólar apostado en i recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero apostado. Una forma equivalente de pensar en la regla de redistribución es que cada dólar apostado en i se reembolsa, luego recibe una parte igual de todo el dinero restante apostado en los resultados perdedores, o P j=i Mj/Mi dólares. En la práctica, la institución del mercado (por ejemplo, el hipódromo) primero se queda con un cierto porcentaje del monto total apostado, generalmente alrededor del 20% en los Estados Unidos, y luego redistribuye el dinero restante a los ganadores en proporción a la cantidad apostada. Considera un ejemplo simple con dos resultados, A y B. Los resultados son mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos, lo que significa que Pr(A ∧ B) = 0 y Pr(A) + Pr(B) = 1. Se apostaron $800 en A y $200 en B. Ahora supongamos que ocurre A (por ejemplo, el caballo A gana la carrera). Las personas que apostaron por B pierden su dinero, o $200 en total. Las personas que apostaron por A ganan y cada una recibe una parte proporcional de los $1000 apostados en total (sin tener en cuenta las comisiones). Específicamente, cada <br>apuesta</br> de $1 en A otorga a su dueño una participación de 1/800 de los $1000, es decir, $1.25. Cada dólar apostado en un mercado de <br>apuesta</br>s mutuas tiene un pago igual, independientemente de cuándo se realizó la <br>apuesta</br> o cuánto dinero se invirtió en los diferentes resultados en el momento en que se realizó la apuesta. El único estado que importa es el estado final: los montos finales apostados en todos los resultados cuando el mercado cierra, y la identidad del resultado correcto. Como resultado, existe un desincentivo para realizar una <br>apuesta</br> temprana si existe la posibilidad de que nueva información esté disponible. Además, no hay garantías sobre la tasa de pago de una apuesta en particular, excepto que será no negativa si se elige el resultado correcto. Las tasas de rendimiento pueden fluctuar arbitrariamente hasta que cierre el mercado. Entonces, una segunda razón para no apostar temprano es esperar para tener una mejor idea de las tasas de pago finales. Esto contrasta con los CDAs y CDAwMMs, como el mercado de valores, donde existen incentivos para invertir tan pronto como se revele nueva información. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel pueden tener la opción de cambiar su resultado elegido, o incluso cancelar su apuesta, antes de que cierren los mercados. Sin embargo, no pueden retirarse del mercado temprano, ya sea para asegurar ganancias o limitar pérdidas, si nueva información favorece un resultado sobre otro, como es posible en un CDA o un CDAwMM. Si los apostadores pueden cancelar o cambiar sus apuestas, entonces un mercado secundario para vender apuestas existentes no tiene sentido: cada dólar apostado vale exactamente $1 hasta que los mercados cierren; nadie compraría por más de $1 y nadie vendería por menos de $1. Los apostadores de pari-mutuel deben esperar hasta que se revele el resultado para darse cuenta de cualquier ganancia o pérdida. A diferencia de un CDA, en un mercado de <br>apuesta</br>s mutuas, cualquier persona puede realizar una <br>apuesta</br> de cualquier cantidad en cualquier momento; en cierto sentido, hay una liquidez infinita para comprar.

                "The spread between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price may be very large, or one or both queues may be completely empty, discouraging trading.2 One way to induce liquidity is to provide a market maker who is willing to accept a large number of buy and sell orders at particular prices.",

                "Now, instead of only matching trades, the system actually takes on risk of its own, and depending on what happens in the future, may lose considerable amounts of money. 2.3 Wagering markets The typical Las Vegas bookmaker or oddsmaker functions much like a market maker in a CDA.",
                "In this case, the market institution (the book or house) sets the odds,4 initially according to expert opinion, and later in response to the relative level of betting on the various outcomes.",
                "Unlike in a pari-mutuel environment, whenever a wager is placed with a bookmaker, the odds or terms for that bet are fixed at the time of the bet.",
                "The bookmaker profits by offering different odds for the two sides of the bet, essentially defining a bidask spread.",
                "While odds may change in response to changing information, any bets made at previously set odds remain in effect according to the odds at the time of the bet; this is precisely in analogy to a CDAwMM.",
                "One difference between a bookmaker and a market maker is that the former usually operates in a take it or leave it mode: bettors cannot place their own limit orders on a common queue, they can in effect only place market orders at prices defined by the bookmaker.",
                "Still, the bookmaker certainly reacts to bettor demand.",
                "Like a market maker, the bookmaker exposes itself to significant risk.",
                "Sports betting markets have also been shown to provide high quality aggregate forecasts [4, 9, 23]. 2.4 Market scoring rule Hansons [11] market scoring rule (MSR) is a new mechanism for hedging and speculating that shares some properties in common with a DPM.",

                "An MSR requires a patron to subsidize the market.",
                "The patrons final loss is variable, and thus technically implies a degree of risk, though the maximum loss is bounded.",
                "An MSR maintains a probability distribution over all events.",
                "At any time any 2 Thin markets do occur often in practice, and can be seen in a variety of the less popular markets available on http://TradeSports.com, or in some financial options markets, for example. 3 A very clear example of a CDAwMM is the interactive betting market on http://WSEX.com. 4 Or, alternatively, the bookmaker sets the game line in order to provide even-money odds. 172 trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [27], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets or illiquidity.",
                "An MSR is not pari-mutuel in nature, as the patron in general injects a variable amount of money into the system.",
                "An MSR provides a two-sided automated market maker, while a DPM provides a one-sided automated market maker.",
                "In an MSR, the vector of payoffs across outcomes is fixed at the time of the trade, while in a DPM, the vector of payoffs across outcomes depends both on the state of wagering at the time of the trade and the state of wagering at the markets close.",

                "Hanson shows how MSRs are especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The patrons payment for subsidizing trading on all 2n possible combinations of n events is no larger than the sum of subsidizing the n event marginals independently.",
                "The mechanism was planned for use in the Policy Analysis Market (PAM), a futures market in Middle East related outcomes and funded by DARPA [20], until a media firestorm killed the project.5 As of this writing, the founders of PAM were considering reopening under private control.6 3.",

                "The traders loss is now limited to $3 at most instead of $5.",
                "If A occurs, the trader breaks even; if B occurs, the trader loses $3.",
                "Also note that-in either DPM formulation-traders can always hedge sell by buying the opposite outcome without the need for any type of aftermarket. 8.",
                "CONCLUSIONS I have presented a new market mechanism for wagering on, or hedging against, a future uncertain event, called a dynamic pari-mutuel market (DPM).",
                "The mechanism combines the infinite liquidity and risk-free nature of a parimutuel market with the dynamic nature of a CDA, making it suitable for continuous information aggregation.",
                "To my knowledge, all existing mechanisms-including the standard pari-mutuel market, the CDA, the CDAwMM, the bookie mechanism, and the MSR-exhibit at most two of the three properties.",
                "An MSR is the closest to a DPM in terms of these properties, if not in terms of mechanics.",
                "Given some natural constraints on price dynamics, I have derived in closed form the implied price functions, which encode how prices change continuously as shares are purchased.",
                "The interface for traders looks much like the familiar CDA, with the system acting as an automated market maker willing to accept an infinite number of buy orders at some price.",
                "I have explored two main variations of a DPM: one where only losing money is redistributed, and one where all money is redistributed.",
                "Each has its own pros and cons, and each supports several reasonable price functions.",
                "I have described the workings of an aftermarket, so that traders can cash out of the market early, like in a CDA, to lock in their gains or limit their losses, an operation that is not possible in a standard pari-mutuel setting. 9.",
                "FUTURE WORK This paper reports the results of an initial investigation of the concept of a dynamic pari-mutuel market.",
                "Many avenues for future work present themselves, including the following: • Random walk conjecture.",
                "The most important question mark in my mind is whether the random walk assumption (3) can be proven under reasonable market efficiency conditions and, if not, how severely it effects the practicality of the system. • Incentive analysis.",
                "Formally, what are the incentives for traders to act on new information and when?",
                "How does the level of initial subsidy effect trader incentives? • Laboratory experiments and field tests.",
                "This paper concentrated on the mathematics and algorithmics of the mechanism.",
                "However, the true test of the mechanisms ability to serve as an instrument for hedging, wagering, or information aggregation is to test it with real traders in a realistic environment.",
                "In reality, how do people behave when faced with a DPM mechanism? • DPM call market.",
                "I have derived the price functions to react to wagers on one outcome at a time.",
                "The mechanism could be generalized to accept orders on both sides, then update the prices wholistically, rather than by assuming a particular sequence on the wagers. • Real-valued variables.",
                "I believe the mechanisms in this paper can easily be generalized to multiple discrete 178 outcomes, and multiple real-valued outcomes that always sum to some constant value (e.g., multiple percentage values that must sum to 100).",
                "However, the generalization to real-valued variables with arbitrary range is less clear, and open for future development. • Compound/combinatorial betting.",
                "I believe that DPM may be well suited for compound [8, 11] or combinatorial [2] betting, for many of the same reasons that market scoring rules [11] are well suited for the task.",
                "DPM may also have some computational advantages over MSR, though this remains to be seen.",
