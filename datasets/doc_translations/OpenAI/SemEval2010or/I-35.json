The distributed management of norms is a challenging issue and we observe a lack of truly distributed computational realisations of normative models. In order to regulate the behaviour of autonomous agents that take part in multiple, related activities, we propose a normative model, the Normative Structure (NS), an artifact that is based on the propagation of normative positions (obligations, prohibitions, permissions), as consequences of agents actions. Within a NS, conflicts may arise due to the dynamic nature of the MAS and the concurrency of agents actions. However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable. We show this by formalising the notion of conflict, providing a mapping of NSs into Coloured Petri Nets and borrowing well-known theoretical results from that field. Since online conflict resolution is required, we present a tractable algorithm to be employed distributedly. We then demonstrate that this algorithm is paramount for the distributed enactment of a NS.

INTRODUCTION A fundamental feature of open, regulated multi-agent systems in which autonomous agents interact, is that participating agents are meant to comply with the conventions of the system. Norms can be used to model such conventions and hence as a means to regulate the observable behaviour of agents [6, 29]. There are many contributions on the subject of norms from sociologists, philosophers and logicians (e.g., [15, 28]). However, there are very few proposals for computational realisations of normative models - the way norms can be integrated in the design and execution of MASs. The few that exist (e.g. [10, 13, 24]), operate in a centralised manner which creates bottlenecks and single points-of-failure. To our knowledge, no proposal truly supports the distributed enactment of normative environments. In our paper we approach that problem and propose means to handle conflicting commitments in open, regulated, multiagent systems in a distributed manner. The type of regulated MAS we envisage consists of multiple, concurrent, related activities where agents interact. Each agent may concurrently participate in several activities, and change from one activity to another. An agents actions within an activity may have consequences in the form of normative positions (i.e. obligations, permissions, and prohibitions) [26] that may constrain its future behaviour. For instance, a buyer agent who runs out of credit may be forbidden to make further offers, or a seller agent is obliged to deliver after closing a deal. We assume that agents may choose not to fulfill all their obligations and hence may be sanctioned by the MAS. Notice that, when activities are distributed, normative positions must flow from the activities in which they are generated to those in which they take effect. For instance, the sellers obligation above must flow (or be propagated) from a negotiation activity to a delivery activity. Since in an open, regulated MAS one cannot embed normative aspects into the agents design, we adopt the view that the MAS should be supplemented with a separate set of norms that further regulates the behaviour of participating agents. In order to model the separation of concerns between the coordination level (agents interactions) and the normative level (propagation of normative positions), we propose an artifact called the Normative Structure (NS). Within a NS conflicts may arise due to the dynamic nature of the MAS and the concurrency of agents actions. For instance, an agent may be obliged and prohibited to do the 636 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS very same action in an activity. Since the regulation of a MAS entails that participating agents need to be aware of the validity of those actions that take place within it, such conflicts ought to be identified and possibly resolved if a claim of validity is needed for an agent to engage in an action or be sanctioned. However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable. We show this by formalising the notion of conflict, providing a mapping of NSs into Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) and borrowing well-known theoretical results from the field of CPNs. We believe that online conflict detection and resolution is required. Hence, we present a tractable algorithm for conflict resolution. This algorithm is paramount for the distributed enactment of a NS. The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we detail a scenario to serve as an example throughout the paper. Next, in Section 3 we formally define the normative structure artifact. Further on, in Section 4 we formalise the notion of conflict to subsequently analyse the complexity of conflict detection in terms of CPNs in Section 5. Section 6 describes the computational management of NSs by describing their enactment and presenting an algorithm for conflict resolution. Finally, we comment on related work, draw conclusions and report on future work in Section 7. 2. SCENARIO We use a supply-chain scenario in which companies and individuals come together at an online marketplace to conduct business. The overall transaction procedure may be organised as six distributed activities, represented as nodes in the diagram in Figure 1. They involve different participants whose behaviour is coordinated through protocols. In this scenario agents can play one of four roles: marExit Registration Payment Delivery Negotiation Coordination Model Contract Figure 1: Activity Structure of the Scenario ketplace accountant (acc), client, supplier (supp) and warehouse managers (wm). The arrows connecting the activities represent how agents can move from one activity to another. After registering at the marketplace, clients and suppliers get together in an activity where they negotiate the terms of their transaction, i.e. prices, amounts of goods to be delivered, deadlines and other details. In the contract activity, the order becomes established and an invoice is prepared. The client will then participate in a payment activity, verifying his credit-worthiness and instructing his bank to transfer the correct amount of money. The supplier in the meantime will arrange for the goods to be delivered (e.g. via a warehouse manager) in the delivery activity. Finally, agents can leave the marketplace conforming to a predetermined exit protocol. The marketplace accountant participates in most of the activities as a trusted provider of auditing tools. In the rest of the paper we shall build on this scenario to exemplify the notion of normative structure and to illustrate our approach to conflict detection and resolution in a distributed setting. 3. NORMATIVE STRUCTURE In MASs agents interact according to protocols which naturally are distributed. We advocate that actions in one such protocol may have an effect on the enactment of other protocols. Certain actions can become prohibited or obligatory, for example. We take normative positions to be obligations, prohibitions and permissions akin to work described in [26]. The intention of adding or removing a normative position we call normative command. Occurrences of normative positions in one protocol may also have consequences for other protocols1 . In order to define our norm language and specify how normative positions are propagated, we have been inspired by multi-context systems [14]. These systems allow the structuring of knowledge into distinct formal theories and the definition of relationships between them. The relationships are expressed as bridge rules - deducibility of formulae in some contexts leads to the deduction of other formulae in other contexts. Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23]. The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes. We are concerned with the propagation and distribution of normative positions within a network of distributed, normative scenes as a consequence of agents actions. We take normative scenes to be sets of normative positions and utterances that are associated with an underlying interaction protocol corresponding to an activity. In this section, we first present a simple language capturing these aspects and formally introduce the notions of normative scene, normative transition rule and normative structure. We give the intended semantics of these rules and show how to control a MAS via norms in an example. 3.1 Basic Concepts The building blocks of our language are terms and atomic formulae: Def. 1. A term, denoted as t, is (i) any constant expressed using lowercase (with or without subscripts), e.g. a, b0, c or (ii) any variable expressed using uppercase (with or without subscripts), e.g. X, Y, Zb or (iii) any function f(t1, . . . , tn), where f is an n-ary function symbol and t1, .., tn are terms. Some examples of terms and functions are Credit, price or offer(bible, 30) being respectively a variable, a constant and a function. We will be making use of identifiers throughout the paper, which are constant terms and also need the following definition: Def. 2. An atomic formula is any construct p(t1, . . . , tn), where p is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1, . . . , tn are terms. The set of all atomic formulae is denoted as Δ. We focus on an expressive class of MASs in which interaction is carried out by means of illocutionary speech acts exchanged among participating agents: Def. 3. Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 637 a set of illocutionary particles (e.g. inform, request, offer); ag, ag are agent identifiers; r, r are role identifiers; δ, an arbitrary ground term, is the content of the message, built from a shared content language; t ∈ N is a time stamp. The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10). Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables. In the description of a protocol, for instance, the precise values of the message exchanged can be left unspecified. During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution. We can thus define illocution schemata: Def. 4. An illocution schema ¯I is any atomic formula p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) in which some of the terms may either be variables or may contain variables. 3.2 Formal Definition of the Notion of NS We first define normative scenes as follows: Def. 5. A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request. Note that the state of a normative scene Δs evolves over time. These normative scenes are connected to one another via normative transitions that specify how utterances and normative positions in one scene affect other normative scenes. As mentioned above, activities are not independent since illocutions uttered in some of them may have an effect on other ones. Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated. These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity. Our transition rules are thus defined: Def. 6. A normative transition rule R is of the form: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) where ¯I is an illocution schema, N is a normative position (i.e. permission, prohibition or obligation), ids is an identifier for activity s and C is a normative command. We endow our language with the usual semantics of rulebased languages [19]. Rules map an existing normative structure to a new normative structure where only the state of the normative scenes change. In the definitions below we rely on the standard concept of substitution [9]. Def. 7. A normative transition is a tuple b = idb, rb where idb is an identifier and rb is a normative transition rule. We are proposing to extend the notion of MAS, regulated by protocols, with an extra layer consisting of normative scenes and normative transitions. This layer is represented as a bi-partite graph that we term normative structure. A normative structure relates normative scenes and normative transitions specifying which normative positions are to be generated or removed in which normative scenes. Def. 8. A normative structure is a labelled bi-partite graph NS = Nodes, Edges, Lin , Lout . Nodes is a set S∪B where S is a set of normative scenes and B is a set of normative transitions. Edges is a set Ain ∪ Aout where Ain ⊆ S × B is a set of input arcs labelled with an atomic formula using the labelling function Lin : Ain → D; and Aout ⊆ B × S is a set of output arcs labelled with a normative position using the labelling function Lout : Aout → N. The following must hold: 1. Each atomic formula appearing in the LHS of a rule rb must be of the form (ids : D) where s ∈ S and D ∈ Δ and ∃ain ∈ Ain such that ain = (s, b) and Lin (ain ) = D. 2. The atomic formula appearing in the RHS of a rule rb must be of the form add(ids : N) or remove(ids : N) where s ∈ S and ∃aout ∈ Aout such that aout = (b, s) and Lout (aout ) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain such that a = (s, b) and b = idb, rb and Lin (a) = D then (ids:D) must occur in the LHS of rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout such that a = (b, s) and b = idb, rb and Lout (a) = N then add(ids : N) or remove(ids : N) must occur in the RHS of rb. The first two points ensure that every atomic formulae on the LHS of a normative transition rule labels an arc entering the appropriate normative transition in the normative structure, and that the atomic formula on the RHS labels the corresponding outgoing arc. Points three and four ensure that labels from all incoming arcs are used in the LHS of the normative transition rule that these arcs enter into, and that the labels from all outgoing arcs are used in the RHS of the normative transition rule that these arcs leave. 3.3 Intended Semantics The formal semantics will be defined via a mapping to Coloured Petri Nets in Section 5.1. Here we start defining the intended semantics of normative transition rules by describing how a rule changes a normative scene of an existing normative structure yielding a new normative structure. Each rule is triggered once for each substitution that unifies the left-hand side V of the rule with the state of the corresponding normative scenes. An atomic formula (i.e. an utterance or a normative position) holds iff it is unifiable with an utterance or normative position that belongs to the state of the corresponding normative scene. Every time a rule is triggered, the normative command specified on the right-hand side of that rule is carried out, intending to add or remove a normative position from the state of the corresponding normative scene. However, addition is not unconditional as conflicts may arise. This topic will be treated in Sections 4 and 6.1. 638 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 3.4 Example In our running example we have the following exemplary normative transition rule: „ payment : obl(inform(X, client, Y, acc, pay(Z, P, Q), T )), payment : utt(inform(X, client, Y, acc, pay(Z, P, Q), T )) « delivery : add(obl(inform(Y, wm, X, client, delivered(Z, Q), T ))) That is, during the payment activity, an obligation on client X to inform accountant Y about the payment P of item Z at time T and the corresponding utterance which fulfills this obligation allows the flow of a norm to the delivery activity. The norm is an obligation on agent Y (this time taking up the role of the warehouse manager wm) to send a message to client X that item Z has been delivered. We show in Figure 2 a diagrammatic representation of how activities and a normative structure relate: Payment Delivery Contract Normative Level Exit Registration Payment Delivery Negotiation Coordination Level Contract nt Figure 2: Activities and Normative Structure As illocutions are uttered during activities, normative positions arise. Utterances and normative positions are combined in transition rules, causing the flow of normative positions between normative scenes. The connection between the two levels is described in Section 6.2. 4. CONFLICT DEFINITION The terms deontic conflict and deontic inconsistency have been used interchangeably in the literature. However, in this paper we adopt the view of [7] in which the authors suggest that a deontic inconsistency arises when an action is simultaneously permitted and prohibited - since a permission may not be acted upon, no real conflict occurs. The situations when an action is simultaneously obliged and prohibited are, however, deontic conflicts, as both obligations and prohibitions influence behaviours in a conflicting fashion. The content of normative positions in this paper are illocutions. Therefore, a normative conflict arises when an illocution is simultaneously obliged and prohibited. We propose to use the standard notion of unification [9] to detect when a prohibition and a permission overlap. For instance, an obligation obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) and a prohibition prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) are in conflict as they unify under σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T }). We formally capture this notion: Def. 9. A (deontic) conflict arises between two normative positions N and N under a substitution σ, denoted as conflict(N, N , σ), if and only if N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I ) and unify(¯I,¯I , σ). That is, a prohibition and an obligation are in conflict if, and only if, their illocutions unify under σ. The substitution σ, called here the conflict set, unifies the agents, roles and atomic formulae. We assume that unify is a suitable implementation of a unification algorithm which i) always terminates (possibly failing, if a unifier cannot be found); ii) is correct; and iii) has linear computational complexity. Inconsistencies caused by the same illocution being simultaneously permitted and prohibited can be formalised similarly. In this paper we focus on prohibition/obligation conflicts, but the computational machinery introduced in Section 6.1 can equally be used to detect prohibition/permission inconsistencies, if we substitute modality obl for per. 5. FORMALISING CONFLICT-FREEDOM In this section we introduce some background knowledge on CPNs assuming a basic understanding of ordinary Petri Nets. For technical details we refer the reader to [16]. We then map NSs to CPNs and analyse their properties. CPNs combine the strength of Petri nets with the strength of functional programming languages. On the one hand, Petri nets provide the primitives for the description of the synchronisation of concurrent processes. As noticed in [16], CPNs have a semantics which builds upon true concurrency, instead of interleaving. In our opinion, a true-concurrency semantics is easier to work with because it is the way we envisage the connection between the coordination level and the normative level of a multi-agent system to be. On the other hand, the functional programming languages used by CPNs provide the primitives for the definition of data types and the manipulation of their data values. Thus, we can readily translate expressions of a normative structure. Last but not least, CPNs have a well-defined semantics which unambiguously defines the behaviour of each CPN. Furthermore, CPNs have a large number of formal analysis methods and tools by which properties of CPNs can be proved. Summing up, CPNs provide us with all the necessary features to formally reason about normative structures given that an adequate mapping is provided. In accordance with Petri nets, the states of a CPN are represented by means of places. But unlike Petri Nets, each place has an associated data type determining the kind of data which the place may contain. A state of a CPN is called a marking. It consists of a number of tokens positioned on the individual places. Each token carries a data value which has the type of the corresponding place. In general, a place may contain two or more tokens with the same data value. Thus, a marking of a CPN is a function which maps each place into a multi-set2 of tokens of the correct type. One often refers to the token values as token colours and one also refers to the data types as colour sets. The types of a CPN can be arbitrarily complex. Actions in a CPN are represented by means of transitions. An incoming arc into a transition from a place indicates that the transition may remove tokens from the corresponding place while an outgoing arc indicates that the transition may add tokens. The exact number of tokens and their data values are determined by the arc expressions, which are encoded using the programming language chosen for the CPN. A transition is enabled in a CPN if and only if all the 2 A multi-set (or bag) is an extension to the notion of set, allowing the possibility of multiple appearances of the same element. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 639 variables in the expressions of its incoming arcs are bound to some value(s) (each one of these bindings is referred to as a binding element). If so, the transition may occur by removing tokens from its input places and adding tokens to its output places. In addition to the arc expressions, it is possible to attach a boolean guard expression (with variables) to each transition. Putting all the elements above together we obtain a formal definition of CPN that shall be employed further ahead for mapping purposes. Def. 10. A CPN is a tuple Σ, P, T, A, N, C, G, E, I where: (i) Σ is a finite set of non-empty types, also called colour sets; (ii) P is a finite set of places; (iii) T is a finite set of transitions; (iv) A is a finite set of arcs; (v) N is a node function defined from A into P × T ∪ T × P; (vi) C is a colour function from P into Σ; (vii) G is a guard function from T into expressions; (viii) E is an arc expression function from A into expressions; (ix) I is an initialisation function from P into closed expressions; Notice that the informal explanation of the enabling and occurrence rules given above provides the foundations to understand the behaviour of a CPN. In accordance with ordinary Petri nets, the concurrent behaviour of a CPN is based on the notion of step. Formally, a step is a non-empty and finite multi-set over the set of all binding elements. Let step S be enabled in a marking M. Then, S may occur, changing the marking M to M . Moreover, we say that marking M is directly reachable from marking M by the occurrence of step S, and we denote it by M[S > M . A finite occurrence sequence is a finite sequence of steps and markings: M1[S1 > M2 . . . Mn[Sn > Mn+1 such that n ∈ N and Mi[Si > Mi+1 ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. The set of all possible markings reachable for a net Net from a marking M is called its reachability set, and is denoted as R(Net, M). 5.1 Mapping to Coloured Petri Nets Our normative structure is a labelled bi-partite graph. The same is true for a Coloured Petri Net. We are presenting a mapping f from one to the other, in order to provide semantics for the normative structure and prove properties about it by using well-known theoretical results from work on CPNs. The mapping f makes use of correspondences between normative scenes and CPN places, normative transitions and CPN transitions and finally, between arc labels and CPN arc expressions. S → P B → T Lin ∪ Lout → E The set of types is the singleton set containing the colour NP (i.e. Σ = {NP}). This complex type is structured as follows (we use CPN-ML [4] syntax): color NPT = with Obl | Per | Prh | NoMod color IP = with inform | declare | offer color UTT = record illp : IP ag1, role1, ag2, role2 : string content: string time : int color NP = record mode : NPT illoc : UTT Modelling illocutions as norms without modality (NoMod) is a formal trick we use to ensure that sub-nets can be combined as explained below. Arcs are mapped almost directly. A is a finite set of arcs and N is a node function, such that ∀a ∈ A ∃a ∈ Ain ∪Aout . N(a) = a . The initialisation function I is defined as I(p) = Δs (∀s ∈ S where p is obtained from s using the mapping; remember that s = ids, Δs ). Finally, the colour function C assigns the colour NP to every place: C(p) = NP (∀p ∈ P). We are not making use of the guard function G. In future work, this function can be used to model constraints when we extend the expressiveness of our norm language. 5.2 Properties of Normative Structures Having defined the mapping from normative structures to Coloured Petri Nets, we now look at properties of CPNs that help us understand the complexity of conflict detection. One question we would like to answer is, whether at a given point in time, a given normative structure is conflict-free. Such a snapshot of a normative structure corresponds to a marking in the mapped CPN. Def. 11. Given a marking Mi, this marking is conflictfree if ¬∃p ∈ P. ∃np1, np2 ∈ Mi(p) such that np1.mode = Obl and np2.mode = Prh and np1.illoc and np2.illoc unify under a valid substitution. Another interesting question would be, whether a conflict will occur from such a snapshot of the system by propagating the normative positions. In order to answer this question, we first translate the snapshot of the normative structure to the corresponding CPN and then execute the finite occurence sequence of markings and steps, verifying the conflict-freedom of each marking as we go along. Def. 12. Given a marking Mi, a finite occurrence sequence Si, Si+1, ..., Sn is called conflict-free, if and only if Mi[Si > Mi+1 . . . Mn[Sn > Mn+1 and Mk is conflict-free for all k such that i ≤ k ≤ n + 1. However, the main question we would like to investigate, is whether or not a given normative structure is conflictresistant, that is, whether or not the agents enacting the MAS are able to bring about conflicts through their actions. As soon as one includes the possibility of actions (or utterances) from autonomous agents, one looses determinism. Having mapped the normative structure to a CPN, we now add CPN models of the agents interactions. Each form of agent interaction (i.e. each activity) can be modelled using CPNs along the lines of Cost et al. [5]. These nondeterministic CPNs feed tokens into the CPN that models the normative structure. This leads to the introduction of non-determinism into the combined CPN. The lower half of figure 3 shows part of a CPN model of an agent protocol where the arc denoted with 1 represents some utterance of an illocution by an agent. The target transition of this arc, not only moves a token on to the next state of this CPN, but also places a token in the place corresponding to the appropriate normative scene in the CPN model of the normative structure (via arc 2). Transition 3 finally could propagate that token in form of an obligation, for example. Thus, from a given marking, many different occurrence sequences are possible depending on the agents actions. We make use of the reachability set R to define a situation in which agents cannot cause conflicts. 640 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Figure 3: Constructing the combined CPN Def. 13. Given a net N, a marking M is conflict-resistant if and only if all markings in R(N,M) are conflict-free. Checking conflict-freedom of a marking can be done in polynomial time by checking all places of the CPN for conflicting tokens. Conflict-freedom of an occurrence sequence in the CPN that represents the normative structure can also be done in polynomial time since this sequence is deterministic given a snapshot. Whether or not a normative structure is designed safely corresponds to checking the conflict-resistance of the initial marking M0. Now, verifying conflict-resistance of a marking becomes a very difficult task. It corresponds to the reachability problem in a CPN: can a state be reached or a marking achieved, that contains a conflict?. This reachability problem is known to be NP-complete for ordinary Petri Nets [22] and since CPNs are functionally identical, we cannot hope to verify conflict-resistance of a normative structure off-line in a reasonable amount of time. Therefore, distributed, run-time mechanisms are needed to ensure that a normative structure maintains consistency. We present one such mechanism in the following section. 6. MANAGING NORMATIVE STRUCTURES Once a conflict (as defined in Section 4) has been detected, we propose to employ the unifier to resolve the conflict. In our example, if the variables in prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) do not get the values specified in substitution σ then there will not be a conflict. However, rather than computing the complement set of a substitution (which can be an infinite set) we propose to annotate the prohibition with the unifier itself and use it to determine what the variables of that prohibition cannot be in future unifications in order to avoid a conflict. We therefore denote annotated prohibitions as prh(¯I) Σ, where Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, is a set of unifiers. Annotated norms3 are interpreted as deontic constructs with curtailed influences, that is, their effect (on agents, roles and illocutions) has been limited by the set Σ of unifiers. A prohibition may be in conflict with various obligations in a given normative scene s = id, Δ and we need to record (and possibly avoid) all these conflicts. We define below an algorithm which ensures that a normative position will be added to a normative scene in such a way that it will not cause any conflicts. 3 Although we propose to curtail prohibitions, the same machinery can be used to define the curtailment of obligations instead. These different policies are dependent on the intended deontic semantics and requirements of the systems addressed. For instance, some MASs may require that their agents should not act in the presence of conflicts, that is, the obligation should be curtailed. 6.1 Conflict Resolution We propose a fine-grained way of resolving normative conflicts via unification. We detect the overlapping of the influences of norms , i.e. how they affect the behaviour of the concerned agents, and we curtail the influence of the normative position, by appropriately using the annotations when checking if the norm applies to illocutions. The algorithm shown in Figure 4 depicts how we maintain a conflict-free set of norms. It adds a given norm N to an existing, conflictfree normative state Δ, obtaining a resulting new normative state Δ which is conflict-free, that is, its prohibitions are annotated with a set of conflict sets indicating which bindings for variables have to be avoided for conflicts not to take place. algorithm addNorm(N, Δ) begin 1 timestamp(N) 2 case N of 3 per(¯I): Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 4 prh(I): if N ∈ Δ s.t. conflict(N, N , σ) then Δ := Δ 5 else Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 6 prh(¯I): 7 begin 8 Σ := ∅ 9 for each N ∈ Δ do 10 if conflict(N, N , σ) then Σ := Σ ∪ {σ} 11 Δ := Δ ∪ {N Σ} 12 end 13 obl(¯I): 14 begin 15 Δ1 := ∅; Δ2 := ∅ 16 for each (N Σ) ∈ Δ do 17 if N = prh(I) then 18 if conflict(N , N, σ) then Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 19 else nil 20 else 21 if conflict(N , N, σ) then 22 begin 23 Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 24 Δ2 := Δ2 ∪ {N (Σ ∪ {σ})} 25 end 26 Δ := (Δ − Δ1) ∪ Δ2 ∪ {N} 27 end 28 end case 29 return Δ end Figure 4: Algorithm to Preserve Conflict-Freedom The algorithm uses a case of structure to differentiate the different possibilities for a given norm N. Line 3 addresses the case when the given norm is a permission: N is simply added to Δ. Lines 4-5 address the case when we attempt to add a ground prohibition to a normative state: if it conflicts with any obligation, then it is discarded; otherwise it is added to the normative state. Lines 6-12 describe the situation when the normative position to be added is a nonground prohibition. In this case, the algorithm initialises Σ to an empty set and loops (line 9-10) through the norms N in the old normative state Δ. Upon finding one that conflicts with N, the algorithm updates Σ by adding the newly found conflict set σ to it (line 10). By looping through Δ, we are able to check any conflicts between the new prohibition and the existing obligations, adequately building the annotation Σ to be used when adding N to Δ in line 11. Lines 13-27 describe how a new obligation is accommodated to an existing normative state. We make use of two initially empty, temporary sets, Δ1, Δ2. The algorithm loops through Δ (lines 16-25) picking up those annotated prohibitions N Σ which conflict with the new obligation. There are, however, two cases to deal with: the one when a ground The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 641 prohibition is found (line 17), and its exception, covering non-ground prohibitions (line 20). In both cases, the old prohibition is stored in Δ1 (lines 18 and 23) to be later removed from Δ (line 26). However, in the case of a nonground prohibition, the algorithm updates its annotation of conflict sets (line 24). The loop guarantees that an exhaustive (linear) search through a normative state takes place, checking if the new obligation is in conflict with any existing prohibitions, possibly updating the annotations of these conflicting prohibitions. In line 26 the algorithm builds the new updated Δ by removing the old prohibitions stored in Δ1 and adding the updated prohibitions stored in Δ2 (if any), as well as the new obligation N. Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations. The annotations can be empty, though: this is the case when we have a ground prohibition or a prohibition which does not unify/conflict with any obligation. Permissions do not affect our algorithm and they are appropriately dealt with (line 3). Any attempt to insert a ground prohibition which conflicts, yields the same normative state (line 4). When a new obligation is being added then the algorithm guarantees that all prohibitions are considered (lines 14-27), leading to the removal of conflicting ground prohibitions or the update of annotations of non-ground prohibitions. The algorithm always terminates: the loops are over a finite set Δ and the conflict checks and set operations always terminate. The complexity of the algorithm is linear: the set Δ is only examined once for each possible case of norm to be added. When managing normative states we may also need to remove normative positions. This is straightforward: permissions can be removed without any problems; annotated prohibitions can also be removed without further considerations; obligations, however, require some housekeeping. When an obligation is to be removed, we must check it against all annotated prohibitions in order to update their annotations. We apply the conflict check and obtain a unifier, then remove this unifier from the prohibitions annotation. We invoke the removal algorithm as removeNorm(N, Δ): it returns a new normative state Δ in which N has been removed, with possible alterations to other normative positions as explained. 6.2 Enactment of a Normative Structure The enactment of a normative structure amounts to the parallel, distributed execution of normative scenes and normative transitions. For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2. With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)). Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene. For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows. Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions. For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2). Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state. We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example. Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1. Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to. In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt. For normative transitions, the process works differently. Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule. In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions. Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes. For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene. The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing. This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once. In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene. Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper. After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7. RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold. Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner. To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction. In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS. However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms. Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent. This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one. The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure. The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns. The normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets. That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular. The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis. In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols. Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs. To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere. Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts. Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved. His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance. The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27]. The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced. These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work. We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS. As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]). We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment. Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies). On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection. The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud. Ten en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa Δs evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás. Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo. Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6. Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una posición normativa (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Definición 7. Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una regla de transición normativa. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un grafo bipartito al que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas. Definición 8. Una estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout. Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1. Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativas describiendo cómo una regla cambia una escena normativa de una estructura normativa existente, dando como resultado una nueva estructura normativa. Cada regla se activa una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes. Una fórmula atómica (es decir, una enunciación o una posición normativa) se cumple si es unificable con una enunciación o posición normativa que pertenece al estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Cada vez que se activa una regla, se lleva a cabo el comando normativo especificado en el lado derecho de esa regla, con la intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa del estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Sin embargo, la adición no es incondicional ya que pueden surgir conflictos. Este tema será tratado en las Secciones 4 y 6.1. 638 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. En nuestro ejemplo en curso tenemos la siguiente regla de transición normativa ejemplar: \"pago: obl(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)), pago: utt(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)) « entrega: add(obl(informar(Y, wm, X, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)))\". Es decir, durante la actividad de pago, una obligación en el cliente X de informar al contador Y sobre el pago P del artículo Z en el tiempo T y la correspondiente declaración que cumple con esta obligación permite el flujo de una norma hacia la actividad de entrega. La norma es una obligación para el agente Y (en este caso asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) de enviar un mensaje al cliente X informando que el artículo Z ha sido entregado. Mostramos en la Figura 2 una representación diagramática de cómo se relacionan las actividades y una estructura normativa: Nivel Normativo Contrato de Entrega de Pago Salida Registro Pago Entrega Negociación Nivel de Coordinación Contrato nt Figura 2: Actividades y Estructura Normativa A medida que se emiten enunciados ilocucionarios durante las actividades, surgen posiciones normativas. Las expresiones y posiciones normativas se combinan en reglas de transición, causando el flujo de posiciones normativas entre escenas normativas. La conexión entre los dos niveles se describe en la Sección 6.2.4. DEFINICIÓN DE CONFLICTO Los términos conflicto deóntico e inconsistencia deóntica se han utilizado indistintamente en la literatura. Sin embargo, en este documento adoptamos la perspectiva de [7] en la que los autores sugieren que surge una inconsistencia deontológica cuando una acción es simultáneamente permitida y prohibida, ya que una permisión puede no ser llevada a cabo, por lo que no se produce un conflicto real. Las situaciones en las que una acción está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida son, sin embargo, conflictos deontológicos, ya que tanto las obligaciones como las prohibiciones influyen en los comportamientos de manera conflictiva. El contenido de las posiciones normativas en este documento son actos ilocutivos. Por lo tanto, surge un conflicto normativo cuando una ilocución está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida. Proponemos utilizar la noción estándar de unificación [9] para detectar cuándo se superponen una prohibición y un permiso. Por ejemplo, una obligación obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) y una prohibición prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T)) están en conflicto ya que se unifican bajo σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T}. Capturamos formalmente esta noción: Def. 9. Un conflicto (deóntico) surge entre dos posiciones normativas N y N bajo una sustitución σ, denotado como conflict(N, N, σ), si y solo si N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I) y unificar(¯I, ¯I, σ). Es decir, una prohibición y una obligación están en conflicto si, y solo si, sus ilocuciones se unifican bajo σ. La sustitución σ, llamada aquí el conjunto de conflictos, unifica a los agentes, roles y fórmulas atómicas. Suponemos que unificar es una implementación adecuada de un algoritmo de unificación que i) siempre termina (posiblemente fallando, si no se puede encontrar un unificador); ii) es correcto; y iii) tiene complejidad computacional lineal. Las inconsistencias causadas por la misma ilocución siendo simultáneamente permitida y prohibida pueden ser formalizadas de manera similar. En este artículo nos enfocamos en conflictos de prohibición/obligación, pero la maquinaria computacional introducida en la Sección 6.1 también puede ser utilizada para detectar inconsistencias de prohibición/permiso, si sustituimos la modalidad obl por per. 5. FORMALIZANDO LA LIBERTAD DE CONFLICTOS En esta sección introducimos algunos conocimientos previos sobre las CPN asumiendo una comprensión básica de las Redes de Petri ordinarias. Para detalles técnicos remitimos al lector a [16]. Luego mapeamos los NSs a los CPNs y analizamos sus propiedades. Las CPNs combinan la potencia de las redes de Petri con la potencia de los lenguajes de programación funcional. Por un lado, las redes de Petri proporcionan los elementos básicos para la descripción de la sincronización de procesos concurrentes. Como se observó en [16], las CPNs tienen una semántica que se basa en la concurrencia verdadera en lugar de la interlección. En nuestra opinión, una semántica de verdadera concurrencia es más fácil de trabajar porque es la forma en que imaginamos que debe ser la conexión entre el nivel de coordinación y el nivel normativo de un sistema multiagente. Por otro lado, los lenguajes de programación funcional utilizados por las CPNs proporcionan los elementos básicos para la definición de tipos de datos y la manipulación de sus valores de datos. Por lo tanto, podemos traducir fácilmente expresiones de una estructura normativa. Por último, pero no menos importante, las CPN tienen una semántica bien definida que define de manera inequívoca el comportamiento de cada CPN. Además, las CPNs cuentan con una gran cantidad de métodos y herramientas de análisis formales mediante los cuales se pueden demostrar propiedades de las CPNs. En resumen, las CPNs nos proporcionan todas las características necesarias para razonar formalmente sobre estructuras normativas siempre que se proporcione un mapeo adecuado. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri, los estados de una CPN se representan mediante lugares. Pero a diferencia de las Redes de Petri, cada lugar tiene un tipo de dato asociado que determina el tipo de datos que el lugar puede contener. Un estado de una CPN se llama marcado. Consiste en una serie de fichas colocadas en los lugares individuales. Cada token lleva consigo un valor de datos que tiene el tipo del lugar correspondiente. En general, un lugar puede contener dos o más fichas con el mismo valor de datos. Por lo tanto, una marca de una CPN es una función que asigna a cada plaza un multiconjunto de fichas del tipo correcto. Uno a menudo se refiere a los valores de los tokens como colores de tokens y también se refiere a los tipos de datos como conjuntos de colores. Los tipos de una CPN pueden ser arbitrariamente complejos. Las acciones en una CPN se representan mediante transiciones. Un arco entrante en una transición desde un lugar indica que la transición puede eliminar fichas del lugar correspondiente, mientras que un arco saliente indica que la transición puede agregar fichas. El número exacto de tokens y sus valores de datos son determinados por las expresiones de arco, las cuales están codificadas utilizando el lenguaje de programación elegido para la CPN. Una transición está habilitada en una CPN si y solo si el multi-conjunto (o bolsa) 2 A es una extensión de la noción de conjunto, permitiendo la posibilidad de múltiples apariciones del mismo elemento. El Sexto Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), 639 variables en las expresiones de sus arcos entrantes están vinculadas a algún valor (cada uno de estos vínculos se denomina elemento de vinculación). Si es así, la transición puede ocurrir al eliminar fichas de sus lugares de entrada y agregar fichas a sus lugares de salida. Además de las expresiones de arco, es posible adjuntar una expresión de guardia booleana (con variables) a cada transición. Al juntar todos los elementos anteriores, obtenemos una definición formal de CPN que se empleará más adelante con fines de mapeo. Definición 10. Un CPN es una tupla Σ, P, T, A, N, C, G, E, I donde: (i) Σ es un conjunto finito de tipos no vacíos, también llamados conjuntos de colores; (ii) P es un conjunto finito de lugares; (iii) T es un conjunto finito de transiciones; (iv) A es un conjunto finito de arcos; (v) N es una función de nodo definida de A en P × T ∪ T × P; (vi) C es una función de color de P en Σ; (vii) G es una función de guarda de T en expresiones; (viii) E es una función de expresión de arco de A en expresiones; (ix) I es una función de inicialización de P en expresiones cerradas; Nótese que la explicación informal de las reglas de habilitación y ocurrencia proporcionadas anteriormente sienta las bases para comprender el comportamiento de un CPN. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri ordinarias, el comportamiento concurrente de una CPN se basa en la noción de paso. Formalmente, un paso es un multi-conjunto no vacío y finito sobre el conjunto de todos los elementos de enlace. Sea el paso S habilitado en una marcación M. Entonces, S puede ocurrir, cambiando la marcación M a M'. Además, decimos que la marca M es directamente alcanzable desde la marca M mediante la ocurrencia del paso S, y lo denotamos como M[S > M. Una secuencia de ocurrencias finitas es una secuencia finita de pasos y marcas: M1[S1 > M2... Mn[Sn > Mn+1 tal que n ∈ N y Mi[Si > Mi+1 ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. \n\n(Note: The original sentence seems to have a typo or missing information, as it is not complete or clear in its meaning.) El conjunto de todas las marcas posibles alcanzables para una red Net desde una marca M se llama su conjunto de alcanzabilidad, y se denota como R(Net, M). 5.1 Mapeo a Redes de Petri Coloreadas. Nuestra estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado. Lo mismo es cierto para una Red de Petri de Colores. Estamos presentando un mapeo f de uno a otro, con el fin de proporcionar semántica para la estructura normativa y demostrar propiedades sobre ella utilizando resultados teóricos bien conocidos del trabajo en CPNs. El mapeo f hace uso de correspondencias entre escenas normativas y lugares de CPN, transiciones normativas y transiciones de CPN y finalmente, entre etiquetas de arco y expresiones de arco de CPN. S → P B → T Lin ∪ Lout → E El conjunto de tipos es el conjunto unitario que contiene el color NP (es decir, Σ = {NP}). Este tipo complejo está estructurado de la siguiente manera (usamos la sintaxis CPN-ML [4]): color NPT = con Obl | Per | Prh | NoMod color IP = con informar | declarar | ofrecer color UTT = registro illp: IP ag1, rol1, ag2, rol2: cadena contenido: cadena tiempo: entero color NP = registro modo: NPT ilocución: UTT Modelar las ilocuciones como normas sin modalidad (NoMod) es un truco formal que utilizamos para asegurar que las subredes puedan combinarse como se explica a continuación. Los arcos son mapeados casi directamente. A es un conjunto finito de arcos y N es una función de nodo, tal que ∀a ∈ A ∃a ∈ Ain ∪Aout. N(a) = a. La función de inicialización I se define como I(p) = Δs (∀s ∈ S donde p se obtiene de s usando el mapeo; recuerda que s = ids, Δs). Finalmente, la función de color C asigna el color NP a cada lugar: C(p) = NP (∀p ∈ P). No estamos haciendo uso de la función de guardia G. En trabajos futuros, esta función puede ser utilizada para modelar restricciones cuando ampliemos la expresividad de nuestro lenguaje normativo. 5.2 Propiedades de Estructuras Normativas Habiendo definido la asignación de estructuras normativas a Redes de Petri de Colores, ahora examinamos propiedades de las RPC que nos ayudan a comprender la complejidad de la detección de conflictos. Una pregunta que nos gustaría responder es si, en un momento dado, una estructura normativa dada está libre de conflictos. Una instantánea de una estructura normativa corresponde a una marca en la CPN mapeada. Definición 11. Dada una marcación Mi, esta marcación es libre de conflictos si ¬∃p ∈ P. ∃np1, np2 ∈ Mi(p) tal que np1.modo = Obl y np2.modo = Prh y np1.illoc y np2.illoc unifican bajo una sustitución válida. Otra pregunta interesante sería si surgirá un conflicto a partir de tal instantánea del sistema al propagar las posiciones normativas. Para responder a esta pregunta, primero traducimos la instantánea de la estructura normativa al CPN correspondiente y luego ejecutamos la secuencia finita de ocurrencias de marcas y pasos, verificando la ausencia de conflictos en cada marca a medida que avanzamos. Definición 12. Dada una marca Mi, una secuencia finita de ocurrencias Si, Si+1, ..., Sn se llama libre de conflictos, si y solo si Mi[Si > Mi+1 . . . Mn[Sn > Mn+1 y Mk es libre de conflictos para todo k tal que i ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Sin embargo, la pregunta principal que nos gustaría investigar es si una estructura normativa dada es resistente al conflicto, es decir, si los agentes que implementan el MAS son capaces de generar conflictos a través de sus acciones. Tan pronto como se incluye la posibilidad de acciones (o enunciados) de agentes autónomos, se pierde el determinismo. Habiendo mapeado la estructura normativa a un CPN, ahora agregamos modelos de CPN de las interacciones de los agentes. Cada forma de interacción de agentes (es decir, cada actividad) puede ser modelada utilizando CPNs siguiendo la línea de Cost et al. [5]. Estas CPN no determinísticas alimentan tokens en la CPN que modela la estructura normativa. Esto conlleva a la introducción de no determinismo en la CPN combinada. La mitad inferior de la figura 3 muestra parte de un modelo CPN de un protocolo de agente donde el arco denotado con 1 representa alguna enunciación de una ilocución por un agente. La transición objetivo de este arco, no solo mueve un token al siguiente estado de esta CPN, sino que también coloca un token en el lugar correspondiente a la escena normativa apropiada en el modelo CPN de la estructura normativa (a través del arco 2). La transición 3 finalmente pudo propagar ese token en forma de obligación, por ejemplo. Por lo tanto, a partir de una marca dada, son posibles muchas secuencias de ocurrencia diferentes dependiendo de las acciones de los agentes. Hacemos uso del conjunto de alcanzabilidad R para definir una situación en la que los agentes no pueden causar conflictos. 640 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) Figura 3: Construyendo la CPN combinada Def. 13. Dado una red N, una marcación M es resistente a conflictos si y solo si todas las marcaciones en R(N,M) son libres de conflictos. Verificar la libertad de conflicto de una marca se puede hacer en tiempo polinómico al revisar todos los lugares de la CPN en busca de fichas en conflicto. La libertad de conflicto de una secuencia de ocurrencias en la CPN que representa la estructura normativa también se puede lograr en tiempo polinómico, ya que esta secuencia es determinista dado un instante. Ya sea que una estructura normativa esté diseñada de manera segura corresponde a verificar la resistencia al conflicto de la marca inicial M0. Ahora, verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una marca se convierte en una tarea muy difícil. Corresponde al problema de alcanzabilidad en una CPN: ¿se puede alcanzar un estado o lograr una marcación que contenga un conflicto? Este problema de alcanzabilidad se sabe que es NP-completo para las Redes de Petri ordinarias [22] y dado que las CPNs son funcionalmente idénticas, no podemos esperar verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una estructura normativa fuera de línea en una cantidad razonable de tiempo. Por lo tanto, se necesitan mecanismos distribuidos en tiempo de ejecución para garantizar que una estructura normativa mantenga la consistencia. Presentamos un mecanismo de este tipo en la siguiente sección. 6. Una vez que se ha detectado un conflicto (según se define en la Sección 4), proponemos emplear el unificador para resolver el conflicto. En nuestro ejemplo, si las variables en prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) no obtienen los valores especificados en la sustitución σ, entonces no habrá un conflicto. Sin embargo, en lugar de calcular el conjunto complementario de una sustitución (que puede ser un conjunto infinito), proponemos anotar la prohibición con el unificador mismo y usarlo para determinar qué variables no pueden ser en futuras unificaciones para evitar un conflicto. Por lo tanto, designamos las prohibiciones anotadas como prh(¯I) Σ, donde Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, es un conjunto de unificadores. Las normas anotadas se interpretan como construcciones deónticas con influencias limitadas, es decir, su efecto (sobre agentes, roles e ilocuciones) ha sido restringido por el conjunto Σ de unificadores. Una prohibición puede estar en conflicto con varias obligaciones en una escena normativa dada s = id, Δ y necesitamos registrar (y posiblemente evitar) todos estos conflictos. A continuación definimos un algoritmo que garantiza que una posición normativa se agregará a una escena normativa de tal manera que no cause conflictos. Aunque proponemos reducir las prohibiciones, la misma maquinaria puede utilizarse para definir la reducción de obligaciones en su lugar. Estas políticas diferentes dependen de la semántica deontológica prevista y de los requisitos de los sistemas abordados. Por ejemplo, algunas MASs pueden requerir que sus agentes no actúen en presencia de conflictos, es decir, que la obligación debe ser limitada. 6.1 Resolución de Conflictos Proponemos una forma detallada de resolver conflictos normativos a través de la unificación. Detectamos la superposición de las influencias de las normas, es decir, cómo afectan el comportamiento de los agentes involucrados, y reducimos la influencia de la posición normativa, utilizando adecuadamente las anotaciones al verificar si la norma se aplica a las ilocuciones. El algoritmo mostrado en la Figura 4 representa cómo mantenemos un conjunto de normas libre de conflictos. Agrega una norma dada N a un estado normativo Δ existente y libre de conflictos, obteniendo un nuevo estado normativo resultante Δ que es libre de conflictos, es decir, sus prohibiciones están anotadas con un conjunto de conjuntos de conflictos que indican qué asignaciones para variables deben evitarse para que no ocurran conflictos. algoritmo addNorm(N, Δ) comienza 1 marca de tiempo(N) 2 caso N de 3 per(¯I): Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 4 prh(I): si N ∈ Δ tal que conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Δ := Δ 5 de lo contrario Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 6 prh(¯I): 7 comienza 8 Σ := ∅ 9 para cada N ∈ Δ hacer 10 si conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Σ := Σ ∪ {σ} 11 Δ := Δ ∪ {N Σ} 12 fin 13 obl(¯I): 14 comienza 15 Δ1 := ∅; Δ2 := ∅ 16 para cada (N Σ) ∈ Δ hacer 17 si N = prh(I) entonces 18 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 19 de lo contrario nulo 20 de lo contrario 21 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces 22 comienza 23 Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 24 Δ2 := Δ2 ∪ {N (Σ ∪ {σ})} 25 fin 26 Δ := (Δ − Δ1) ∪ Δ2 ∪ {N} 27 fin 28 fin caso 29 devolver Δ fin Figura 4: Algoritmo para Preservar la Libertad de Conflictos El algoritmo utiliza una estructura de caso para diferenciar las diferentes posibilidades para una norma dada N. La línea 3 aborda el caso en el que la norma dada es un permiso: N simplemente se agrega a Δ. Las líneas 4-5 abordan el caso en el que intentamos agregar una prohibición de base a un estado normativo: si entra en conflicto con alguna obligación, entonces se descarta; de lo contrario, se agrega al estado normativo. Las líneas 6-12 describen la situación cuando la posición normativa a añadir es una prohibición no fundamentada. En este caso, el algoritmo inicializa Σ como un conjunto vacío y recorre en bucle (línea 9-10) las normas N en el estado normativo anterior Δ. Al encontrar uno que entre en conflicto con N, el algoritmo actualiza Σ agregando el conjunto de conflictos recién encontrado σ a él (línea 10). Al recorrer Δ en un bucle, podemos verificar cualquier conflicto entre la nueva prohibición y las obligaciones existentes, construyendo adecuadamente la anotación Σ que se utilizará al agregar N a Δ en la línea 11. Las líneas 13-27 describen cómo una nueva obligación se adapta a un estado normativo existente. Hacemos uso de dos conjuntos temporales inicialmente vacíos, Δ1, Δ2. El algoritmo recorre Δ (líneas 16-25) recogiendo aquellas prohibiciones anotadas N Σ que entran en conflicto con la nueva obligación. Sin embargo, hay dos casos con los que tratar: uno cuando un terreno La Sexta Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se encuentra la prohibición 641 (línea 17) y su excepción, que abarca prohibiciones no fundamentadas (línea 20). En ambos casos, la antigua prohibición se almacena en Δ1 (líneas 18 y 23) para ser posteriormente eliminada de Δ (línea 26). Sin embargo, en el caso de una prohibición no basada en tierra, el algoritmo actualiza su anotación de conjuntos de conflictos (línea 24). El bucle garantiza que se realice una búsqueda exhaustiva (lineal) a través de un estado normativo, verificando si la nueva obligación entra en conflicto con alguna prohibición existente, posiblemente actualizando las anotaciones de estas prohibiciones conflictivas. En la línea 26, el algoritmo construye el nuevo Δ actualizado eliminando las antiguas prohibiciones almacenadas en Δ1 y agregando las prohibiciones actualizadas almacenadas en Δ2 (si las hay), así como la nueva obligación N. Nuestro algoritmo propuesto es correcto en el sentido de que, para una posición normativa N dada y un estado normativo Δ, proporciona un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que todas las prohibiciones tienen anotaciones que registran cómo se unifican con las obligaciones existentes. Las anotaciones pueden estar vacías, sin embargo, este es el caso cuando tenemos una prohibición de base o una prohibición que no unifica/conflicta con ninguna obligación. Los permisos no afectan nuestro algoritmo y se manejan adecuadamente (línea 3). Cualquier intento de insertar una prohibición de base que entre en conflicto, produce el mismo estado normativo (línea 4). Cuando se agrega una nueva obligación, el algoritmo garantiza que se consideren todas las prohibiciones (líneas 14-27), lo que lleva a la eliminación de prohibiciones fundamentales conflictivas o la actualización de anotaciones de prohibiciones no fundamentales. El algoritmo siempre termina: los bucles están sobre un conjunto finito Δ y las verificaciones de conflictos y operaciones de conjunto siempre terminan. La complejidad del algoritmo es lineal: el conjunto Δ solo se examina una vez para cada posible caso de norma que se agregue. Al gestionar estados normativos, también puede ser necesario eliminar posiciones normativas. Esto es sencillo: los permisos se pueden eliminar sin problemas; las prohibiciones anotadas también se pueden eliminar sin más consideraciones; sin embargo, las obligaciones requieren cierto mantenimiento. Cuando una obligación debe ser eliminada, debemos verificarla con todas las prohibiciones anotadas para actualizar sus anotaciones. Aplicamos la verificación de conflictos y obtenemos un unificador, luego eliminamos este unificador de la anotación de prohibiciones. Invocamos el algoritmo de eliminación como removeNorm(N, Δ): devuelve un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que se ha eliminado N, con posibles alteraciones en otras posiciones normativas como se explica. 6.2 Promulgación de una Estructura Normativa La promulgación de una estructura normativa implica la ejecución paralela y distribuida de escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Con fines ilustrativos, a continuación describiremos la interacción entre las escenas normativas de pago y entrega y la transición normativa nt que las vincula en la mitad superior de la figura 2. Con este objetivo, considere por ejemplo que obl(inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpago y que Δentrega sostiene prh(inform(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)). Tales estados indican que el cliente Jules está obligado a pagar £400 por 350 kg de cobre al contador Rod de acuerdo con la escena normativa de pago, mientras que Rod, asumiendo el papel de gerente de almacén en esta ocasión, tiene prohibido entregar cualquier cosa al cliente Jules de acuerdo con la escena normativa de entrega. Para cada escena normativa, el proceso de promulgación es el siguiente. En primer lugar, procesa su cola de mensajes entrantes que contiene tres tipos de mensajes: enunciados de la actividad a la que está vinculado; y comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar posiciones normativas. Por ejemplo, en nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago recopila la ilocución I = utt((inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), 35)) que representa al cliente Jules pendiente de pago por cobre (a través de la flecha A en la figura 2). Las expresiones son marcadas con la hora y luego se agregan al estado normativo. Tendríamos Δpago = Δpago ∪ {I}, en nuestro ejemplo. Al recibir comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar una posición normativa, la escena normativa invoca el algoritmo de adición o eliminación correspondiente descrito en la Sección 6.1. En segundo lugar, la escena normativa reconoce su cambio de estado al enviar un mensaje de activación a cada transición normativa saliente a la que está conectada. En nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago estaría señalando su cambio de estado a la transición normativa nt. Para las transiciones normativas, el proceso funciona de manera diferente. Debido a que cada transición normativa controla la operación de una regla única, al recibir un mensaje de activación, sondea cada escena normativa entrante en busca de sustituciones para los esquemas ilocucionales relevantes en el LHS de su regla. En nuestro ejemplo, nt (siendo responsable de la regla descrita en la Sección 3.4), sondearía la escena normativa de pagos (a través de la flecha B) en busca de sustituciones. Al recibir respuestas de ellos (en forma de conjuntos de sustituciones junto con marcas de tiempo), se deben unificar las sustituciones de cada una de estas escenas normativas. Para cada unificación que encuentra, la regla se activa, y por lo tanto se envía el comando normativo correspondiente a la escena normativa de salida. La transición normativa luego lleva un registro del mensaje de activación que envió y de los sellos de tiempo de las posiciones normativas que desencadenaron la activación. Esto se hace para asegurar que las mismas posiciones normativas en el LHS de una regla solo activen su disparo una vez. En nuestro ejemplo, nt estaría recibiendo σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} de la escena normativa de pago. Dado que las sustituciones en σ unifican con la regla nts, la regla se activa y se envía el comando normativo adicionar(entrega : obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350), T)) a la escena normativa de entrega para obligar a Rod a entregar al cliente Jules 350 kg de cobre. Después de eso, la escena normativa de entrega invocaría el algoritmo addNorm de la figura 4 con Δentrega y N = obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350)) como argumentos. 7. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Y CONCLUSIONES Nuestras contribuciones en este artículo son triples. En primer lugar, presentamos un enfoque para la gestión y razonamiento sobre normas de manera distribuida. Hasta donde sabemos, hay poco trabajo publicado en esta dirección. En [8, 21], se presentan dos idiomas para la aplicación distribuida de normas en MAS. Sin embargo, en ambos trabajos, cada agente tiene una interfaz de mensajes local que reenvía mensajes legales de acuerdo con un conjunto de normas. Dado que estas interfaces son locales para cada agente, las normas solo pueden expresarse en términos de acciones de ese agente. Esta es una seria desventaja, por ejemplo, cuando se necesita activar una obligación hacia un agente debido a un mensaje de otro. La segunda contribución es la propuesta de una estructura normativa. La noción es fructífera porque permite la separación de preocupaciones normativas y procedimentales. La estructura normativa que proponemos pone de manifiesto la similitud entre la propagación de posiciones normativas y la propagación 642 de la Sexta Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) de tokens en Redes de Petri de Colores. Esa similitud sugiere fácilmente un mapeo entre ambos, y proporciona fundamentos para un tratamiento analítico conveniente de la estructura normativa, en general, y la complejidad de la detección de conflictos, en particular. La idea de modelar interacciones (en forma de conversaciones) a través de Redes de Petri ha sido investigada en [18], donde el medio de interacción y los agentes individuales son modelados como subredes de CPN que posteriormente se combinan para su análisis. En [5], las conversaciones se diseñan y analizan primero a nivel de CPNs y luego se traducen a protocolos. Lin et al. [20] mapean los esquemas de conversación a CPNs. Hasta donde sabemos, el uso de esta representación en el apoyo a la detección de conflictos en MAS regulados no ha sido reportado en otro lugar. Finalmente, presentamos un mecanismo distribuido para resolver conflictos normativos. Sartor [25] aborda los conflictos normativos desde el punto de vista de la teoría legal y sugiere una forma de ordenar las normas involucradas. Su idea se implementa en [12] pero requiere un recurso central para el mantenimiento de la norma. El enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos es una adaptación y extensión del trabajo sobre grafos de instanciación reportado en [17] y un algoritmo relacionado en [27]. El algoritmo presentado en el artículo actual se puede utilizar para gestionar estados normativos de forma distribuida: escenas normativas que ocurren en paralelo tienen un estado normativo asociado Δ al cual el algoritmo se aplica de forma independiente cada vez que se introduce una nueva norma. Estas tres contribuciones que presentamos en este artículo abren muchas posibilidades para trabajos futuros. Deberíamos mencionar primero que, como estrategia general, estamos trabajando en una generalización de la noción de estructura normativa para hacerla operar con diferentes modelos de coordinación, con un contenido deóntico más rico y sobre diferentes realizaciones computacionales de MAS regulados. Como primer paso en esta dirección, estamos aprovechando el desacoplamiento entre los protocolos de interacción y la orientación normativa declarativa que la estructura normativa pone a disposición, para proporcionar una capa normativa para las instituciones electrónicas (como se define en [1]). Esperamos que dicho acoplamiento dote a las instituciones electrónicas de un entorno normativo más flexible y expresivo. Además, queremos ampliar nuestro modelo en varias direcciones: (1) para manejar la negación y restricciones como parte del lenguaje normativo, y en particular la noción de tiempo; (2) para acomodar múltiples autoridades normativas jerárquicas basadas en roles, siguiendo las líneas de Cholvy y Cuppens [3] y las relaciones de poder sugeridas por Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) para capturar en el algoritmo de resolución de conflictos diferentes semánticas relacionadas con las nociones deónticas mediante el apoyo a diferentes axiomatizaciones (por ejemplo, la fuerza relativa de la prohibición versus la obligación, nociones deónticas por defecto, inconsistencias deónticas). En el lado teórico, pretendemos utilizar técnicas de análisis de CPNs para caracterizar clases de CPNs (por ejemplo, acíclicos, simétricos, etc.) correspondientes a familias de Estructuras Normativas que son susceptibles a la detección de conflictos offline manejables. La combinación de estas técnicas junto con nuestros mecanismos en línea de resolución de conflictos tiene como objetivo dotar a los diseñadores de MAS con la capacidad de incorporar normas en sus sistemas de manera fundamentada.

        "The distributed management of norms is a challenging issue and we observe a lack of truly distributed computational realisations of normative models.",
        "In order to regulate the behaviour of autonomous agents that take part in multiple, related activities, we propose a normative model, the Normative Structure (NS), an artifact that is based on the propagation of normative positions (obligations, prohibitions, permissions), as consequences of agents actions.",

        "However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable.",

        "INTRODUCTION A fundamental feature of open, regulated multi-agent systems in which autonomous agents interact, is that participating agents are meant to comply with the conventions of the system.",
        "Norms can be used to model such conventions and hence as a means to regulate the observable behaviour of agents [6, 29].",
        "There are many contributions on the subject of norms from sociologists, philosophers and logicians (e.g., [15, 28]).",
        "However, there are very few proposals for computational realisations of normative models - the way norms can be integrated in the design and execution of MASs.",
        "The few that exist (e.g. [10, 13, 24]), operate in a centralised manner which creates bottlenecks and single points-of-failure.",
        "To our knowledge, no proposal truly supports the distributed enactment of normative environments.",
        "In our paper we approach that problem and propose means to handle conflicting commitments in open, regulated, multiagent systems in a distributed manner.",
        "The type of regulated MAS we envisage consists of multiple, concurrent, related activities where agents interact.",
        "Each agent may concurrently participate in several activities, and change from one activity to another.",
        "An agents actions within an activity may have consequences in the form of normative positions (i.e. obligations, permissions, and prohibitions) [26] that may constrain its future behaviour.",
        "For instance, a buyer agent who runs out of credit may be forbidden to make further offers, or a seller agent is obliged to deliver after closing a deal.",
        "We assume that agents may choose not to fulfill all their obligations and hence may be sanctioned by the MAS.",
        "Notice that, when activities are distributed, normative positions must flow from the activities in which they are generated to those in which they take effect.",
        "For instance, the sellers obligation above must flow (or be propagated) from a negotiation activity to a delivery activity.",
        "Since in an open, regulated MAS one cannot embed normative aspects into the agents design, we adopt the view that the MAS should be supplemented with a separate set of norms that further regulates the behaviour of participating agents.",
        "In order to model the separation of concerns between the coordination level (agents interactions) and the normative level (propagation of normative positions), we propose an artifact called the Normative Structure (NS).",
        "Within a NS conflicts may arise due to the dynamic nature of the MAS and the concurrency of agents actions.",
        "For instance, an agent may be obliged and prohibited to do the 636 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS very same action in an activity.",
        "Since the regulation of a MAS entails that participating agents need to be aware of the validity of those actions that take place within it, such conflicts ought to be identified and possibly resolved if a claim of validity is needed for an agent to engage in an action or be sanctioned.",
        "However, ensuring conflict-freedom of a NS at design time is computationally intractable.",
        "We show this by formalising the notion of conflict, providing a mapping of NSs into Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs) and borrowing well-known theoretical results from the field of CPNs.",
        "We believe that online conflict detection and resolution is required.",
        "Hence, we present a tractable algorithm for conflict resolution.",
        "This algorithm is paramount for the distributed enactment of a NS.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we detail a scenario to serve as an example throughout the paper.",
        "Next, in Section 3 we formally define the normative structure artifact.",
        "Further on, in Section 4 we formalise the notion of conflict to subsequently analyse the complexity of conflict detection in terms of CPNs in Section 5.",
        "Section 6 describes the computational management of NSs by describing their enactment and presenting an algorithm for conflict resolution.",
        "Finally, we comment on related work, draw conclusions and report on future work in Section 7. 2.",
        "SCENARIO We use a supply-chain scenario in which companies and individuals come together at an online marketplace to conduct business.",
        "The overall transaction procedure may be organised as six distributed activities, represented as nodes in the diagram in Figure 1.",
        "They involve different participants whose behaviour is coordinated through protocols.",
        "In this scenario agents can play one of four roles: marExit Registration Payment Delivery Negotiation Coordination Model Contract Figure 1: Activity Structure of the Scenario ketplace accountant (acc), client, supplier (supp) and warehouse managers (wm).",
        "The arrows connecting the activities represent how agents can move from one activity to another.",
        "After registering at the marketplace, clients and suppliers get together in an activity where they negotiate the terms of their transaction, i.e. prices, amounts of goods to be delivered, deadlines and other details.",
        "In the contract activity, the order becomes established and an invoice is prepared.",
        "The client will then participate in a payment activity, verifying his credit-worthiness and instructing his bank to transfer the correct amount of money.",
        "The supplier in the meantime will arrange for the goods to be delivered (e.g. via a warehouse manager) in the delivery activity.",
        "Finally, agents can leave the marketplace conforming to a predetermined exit protocol.",
        "The marketplace accountant participates in most of the activities as a trusted provider of auditing tools.",
        "In the rest of the paper we shall build on this scenario to exemplify the notion of normative structure and to illustrate our approach to conflict detection and resolution in a distributed setting. 3.",
        "NORMATIVE STRUCTURE In MASs agents interact according to protocols which naturally are distributed.",
        "We advocate that actions in one such protocol may have an effect on the enactment of other protocols.",
        "Certain actions can become prohibited or obligatory, for example.",
        "We take normative positions to be obligations, prohibitions and permissions akin to work described in [26].",
        "The intention of adding or removing a normative position we call normative command.",
        "Occurrences of normative positions in one protocol may also have consequences for other protocols1 .",
        "In order to define our norm language and specify how normative positions are propagated, we have been inspired by multi-context systems [14].",
        "These systems allow the structuring of knowledge into distinct formal theories and the definition of relationships between them.",
        "The relationships are expressed as bridge rules - deducibility of formulae in some contexts leads to the deduction of other formulae in other contexts.",
        "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
        "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",
        "We are concerned with the propagation and distribution of normative positions within a network of distributed, normative scenes as a consequence of agents actions.",
        "We take normative scenes to be sets of normative positions and utterances that are associated with an underlying interaction protocol corresponding to an activity.",
        "In this section, we first present a simple language capturing these aspects and formally introduce the notions of normative scene, normative transition rule and normative structure.",
        "We give the intended semantics of these rules and show how to control a MAS via norms in an example. 3.1 Basic Concepts The building blocks of our language are terms and atomic formulae: Def. 1.",
        "A term, denoted as t, is (i) any constant expressed using lowercase (with or without subscripts), e.g. a, b0, c or (ii) any variable expressed using uppercase (with or without subscripts), e.g.",
        "X, Y, Zb or (iii) any function f(t1, . . . , tn), where f is an n-ary function symbol and t1, .., tn are terms.",
        "Some examples of terms and functions are Credit, price or offer(bible, 30) being respectively a variable, a constant and a function.",
        "We will be making use of identifiers throughout the paper, which are constant terms and also need the following definition: Def. 2.",
        "An atomic formula is any construct p(t1, . . . , tn), where p is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1, . . . , tn are terms.",
        "The set of all atomic formulae is denoted as Δ.",
        "We focus on an expressive class of MASs in which interaction is carried out by means of illocutionary speech acts exchanged among participating agents: Def. 3.",
        "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",
        "The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 637 a set of illocutionary particles (e.g. inform, request, offer); ag, ag are agent identifiers; r, r are role identifiers; δ, an arbitrary ground term, is the content of the message, built from a shared content language; t ∈ N is a time stamp.",
        "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
        "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",
        "In the description of a protocol, for instance, the precise values of the message exchanged can be left unspecified.",
        "During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution.",
        "We can thus define illocution schemata: Def. 4.",
        "An illocution schema ¯I is any atomic formula p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) in which some of the terms may either be variables or may contain variables. 3.2 Formal Definition of the Notion of NS We first define normative scenes as follows: Def. 5.",
        "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request.",
        "Note that the state of a normative scene Δs evolves over time.",
        "These normative scenes are connected to one another via normative transitions that specify how utterances and normative positions in one scene affect other normative scenes.",
        "As mentioned above, activities are not independent since illocutions uttered in some of them may have an effect on other ones.",
        "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
        "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",
        "Our transition rules are thus defined: Def. 6.",
        "A normative transition rule R is of the form: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) where ¯I is an illocution schema, N is a normative position (i.e. permission, prohibition or obligation), ids is an identifier for activity s and C is a normative command.",
        "We endow our language with the usual semantics of rulebased languages [19].",
        "Rules map an existing normative structure to a new normative structure where only the state of the normative scenes change.",
        "In the definitions below we rely on the standard concept of substitution [9].",
        "Def. 7.",
        "A normative transition is a tuple b = idb, rb where idb is an identifier and rb is a normative transition rule.",
        "We are proposing to extend the notion of MAS, regulated by protocols, with an extra layer consisting of normative scenes and normative transitions.",
        "This layer is represented as a bi-partite graph that we term normative structure.",
        "A normative structure relates normative scenes and normative transitions specifying which normative positions are to be generated or removed in which normative scenes.",
        "Def. 8.",
        "A normative structure is a labelled bi-partite graph NS = Nodes, Edges, Lin , Lout .",
        "Nodes is a set S∪B where S is a set of normative scenes and B is a set of normative transitions.",
        "Edges is a set Ain ∪ Aout where Ain ⊆ S × B is a set of input arcs labelled with an atomic formula using the labelling function Lin : Ain → D; and Aout ⊆ B × S is a set of output arcs labelled with a normative position using the labelling function Lout : Aout → N. The following must hold: 1.",
        "Each atomic formula appearing in the LHS of a rule rb must be of the form (ids : D) where s ∈ S and D ∈ Δ and ∃ain ∈ Ain such that ain = (s, b) and Lin (ain ) = D. 2.",
        "The atomic formula appearing in the RHS of a rule rb must be of the form add(ids : N) or remove(ids : N) where s ∈ S and ∃aout ∈ Aout such that aout = (b, s) and Lout (aout ) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain such that a = (s, b) and b = idb, rb and Lin (a) = D then (ids:D) must occur in the LHS of rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout such that a = (b, s) and b = idb, rb and Lout (a) = N then add(ids : N) or remove(ids : N) must occur in the RHS of rb.",
        "The first two points ensure that every atomic formulae on the LHS of a normative transition rule labels an arc entering the appropriate normative transition in the normative structure, and that the atomic formula on the RHS labels the corresponding outgoing arc.",
        "Points three and four ensure that labels from all incoming arcs are used in the LHS of the normative transition rule that these arcs enter into, and that the labels from all outgoing arcs are used in the RHS of the normative transition rule that these arcs leave. 3.3 Intended Semantics The formal semantics will be defined via a mapping to Coloured Petri Nets in Section 5.1.",
        "Here we start defining the intended semantics of normative transition rules by describing how a rule changes a normative scene of an existing normative structure yielding a new normative structure.",
        "Each rule is triggered once for each substitution that unifies the left-hand side V of the rule with the state of the corresponding normative scenes.",
        "An atomic formula (i.e. an utterance or a normative position) holds iff it is unifiable with an utterance or normative position that belongs to the state of the corresponding normative scene.",
        "Every time a rule is triggered, the normative command specified on the right-hand side of that rule is carried out, intending to add or remove a normative position from the state of the corresponding normative scene.",
        "However, addition is not unconditional as conflicts may arise.",
        "This topic will be treated in Sections 4 and 6.1. 638 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 3.4 Example In our running example we have the following exemplary normative transition rule: „ payment : obl(inform(X, client, Y, acc, pay(Z, P, Q), T )), payment : utt(inform(X, client, Y, acc, pay(Z, P, Q), T )) « delivery : add(obl(inform(Y, wm, X, client, delivered(Z, Q), T ))) That is, during the payment activity, an obligation on client X to inform accountant Y about the payment P of item Z at time T and the corresponding utterance which fulfills this obligation allows the flow of a norm to the delivery activity.",
        "The norm is an obligation on agent Y (this time taking up the role of the warehouse manager wm) to send a message to client X that item Z has been delivered.",
        "We show in Figure 2 a diagrammatic representation of how activities and a normative structure relate: Payment Delivery Contract Normative Level Exit Registration Payment Delivery Negotiation Coordination Level Contract nt Figure 2: Activities and Normative Structure As illocutions are uttered during activities, normative positions arise.",
        "Utterances and normative positions are combined in transition rules, causing the flow of normative positions between normative scenes.",
        "The connection between the two levels is described in Section 6.2. 4.",
        "CONFLICT DEFINITION The terms deontic conflict and deontic inconsistency have been used interchangeably in the literature.",
        "However, in this paper we adopt the view of [7] in which the authors suggest that a deontic inconsistency arises when an action is simultaneously permitted and prohibited - since a permission may not be acted upon, no real conflict occurs.",
        "The situations when an action is simultaneously obliged and prohibited are, however, deontic conflicts, as both obligations and prohibitions influence behaviours in a conflicting fashion.",
        "The content of normative positions in this paper are illocutions.",
        "Therefore, a normative conflict arises when an illocution is simultaneously obliged and prohibited.",
        "We propose to use the standard notion of unification [9] to detect when a prohibition and a permission overlap.",
        "For instance, an obligation obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) and a prohibition prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) are in conflict as they unify under σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T }).",
        "We formally capture this notion: Def. 9.",
        "A (deontic) conflict arises between two normative positions N and N under a substitution σ, denoted as conflict(N, N , σ), if and only if N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I ) and unify(¯I,¯I , σ).",
        "That is, a prohibition and an obligation are in conflict if, and only if, their illocutions unify under σ.",
        "The substitution σ, called here the conflict set, unifies the agents, roles and atomic formulae.",
        "We assume that unify is a suitable implementation of a unification algorithm which i) always terminates (possibly failing, if a unifier cannot be found); ii) is correct; and iii) has linear computational complexity.",
        "Inconsistencies caused by the same illocution being simultaneously permitted and prohibited can be formalised similarly.",
        "In this paper we focus on prohibition/obligation conflicts, but the computational machinery introduced in Section 6.1 can equally be used to detect prohibition/permission inconsistencies, if we substitute modality obl for per. 5.",
        "FORMALISING CONFLICT-FREEDOM In this section we introduce some background knowledge on CPNs assuming a basic understanding of ordinary Petri Nets.",
        "For technical details we refer the reader to [16].",
        "We then map NSs to CPNs and analyse their properties.",
        "CPNs combine the strength of Petri nets with the strength of functional programming languages.",
        "On the one hand, Petri nets provide the primitives for the description of the synchronisation of concurrent processes.",
        "As noticed in [16], CPNs have a semantics which builds upon true concurrency, instead of interleaving.",
        "In our opinion, a true-concurrency semantics is easier to work with because it is the way we envisage the connection between the coordination level and the normative level of a multi-agent system to be.",
        "On the other hand, the functional programming languages used by CPNs provide the primitives for the definition of data types and the manipulation of their data values.",
        "Thus, we can readily translate expressions of a normative structure.",
        "Last but not least, CPNs have a well-defined semantics which unambiguously defines the behaviour of each CPN.",
        "Furthermore, CPNs have a large number of formal analysis methods and tools by which properties of CPNs can be proved.",
        "Summing up, CPNs provide us with all the necessary features to formally reason about normative structures given that an adequate mapping is provided.",
        "In accordance with Petri nets, the states of a CPN are represented by means of places.",
        "But unlike Petri Nets, each place has an associated data type determining the kind of data which the place may contain.",
        "A state of a CPN is called a marking.",
        "It consists of a number of tokens positioned on the individual places.",
        "Each token carries a data value which has the type of the corresponding place.",
        "In general, a place may contain two or more tokens with the same data value.",
        "Thus, a marking of a CPN is a function which maps each place into a multi-set2 of tokens of the correct type.",
        "One often refers to the token values as token colours and one also refers to the data types as colour sets.",
        "The types of a CPN can be arbitrarily complex.",
        "Actions in a CPN are represented by means of transitions.",

In future work, this function can be used to model constraints when we extend the expressiveness of our norm language. 5.2 Properties of Normative Structures Having defined the mapping from normative structures to Coloured Petri Nets, we now look at properties of CPNs that help us understand the complexity of conflict detection.",
        "One question we would like to answer is, whether at a given point in time, a given normative structure is conflict-free.",

        "Another interesting question would be, whether a conflict will occur from such a snapshot of the system by propagating the normative positions.",

        "Mn[Sn > Mn+1 and Mk is conflict-free for all k such that i ≤ k ≤ n + 1.",
        "However, the main question we would like to investigate, is whether or not a given normative structure is conflictresistant, that is, whether or not the agents enacting the MAS are able to bring about conflicts through their actions.",

        "These nondeterministic CPNs feed tokens into the CPN that models the normative structure.",
        "This leads to the introduction of non-determinism into the combined CPN.",
        "The lower half of figure 3 shows part of a CPN model of an agent protocol where the arc denoted with 1 represents some utterance of an illocution by an agent.",
        "The target transition of this arc, not only moves a token on to the next state of this CPN, but also places a token in the place corresponding to the appropriate normative scene in the CPN model of the normative structure (via arc 2).",
        "Transition 3 finally could propagate that token in form of an obligation, for example.",
        "Thus, from a given marking, many different occurrence sequences are possible depending on the agents actions.",

        "Conflict-freedom of an occurrence sequence in the CPN that represents the normative structure can also be done in polynomial time since this sequence is deterministic given a snapshot.",
        "Whether or not a normative structure is designed safely corresponds to checking the conflict-resistance of the initial marking M0.",
        "Now, verifying conflict-resistance of a marking becomes a very difficult task.",
        "It corresponds to the reachability problem in a CPN: can a state be reached or a marking achieved, that contains a conflict?.",
        "This reachability problem is known to be NP-complete for ordinary Petri Nets [22] and since CPNs are functionally identical, we cannot hope to verify conflict-resistance of a normative structure off-line in a reasonable amount of time.",
        "Therefore, distributed, run-time mechanisms are needed to ensure that a normative structure maintains consistency.",
        "We present one such mechanism in the following section. 6.",
        "MANAGING NORMATIVE STRUCTURES Once a conflict (as defined in Section 4) has been detected, we propose to employ the unifier to resolve the conflict.",
        "In our example, if the variables in prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) do not get the values specified in substitution σ then there will not be a conflict.",
        "However, rather than computing the complement set of a substitution (which can be an infinite set) we propose to annotate the prohibition with the unifier itself and use it to determine what the variables of that prohibition cannot be in future unifications in order to avoid a conflict.",
        "We therefore denote annotated prohibitions as prh(¯I) Σ, where Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, is a set of unifiers.",
        "Annotated norms3 are interpreted as deontic constructs with curtailed influences, that is, their effect (on agents, roles and illocutions) has been limited by the set Σ of unifiers.",
        "A prohibition may be in conflict with various obligations in a given normative scene s = id, Δ and we need to record (and possibly avoid) all these conflicts.",
        "We define below an algorithm which ensures that a normative position will be added to a normative scene in such a way that it will not cause any conflicts. 3 Although we propose to curtail prohibitions, the same machinery can be used to define the curtailment of obligations instead.",
        "These different policies are dependent on the intended deontic semantics and requirements of the systems addressed.",
        "For instance, some MASs may require that their agents should not act in the presence of conflicts, that is, the obligation should be curtailed. 6.1 Conflict Resolution We propose a fine-grained way of resolving normative conflicts via unification.",
        "We detect the overlapping of the influences of norms , i.e. how they affect the behaviour of the concerned agents, and we curtail the influence of the normative position, by appropriately using the annotations when checking if the norm applies to illocutions.",
        "The algorithm shown in Figure 4 depicts how we maintain a conflict-free set of norms.",
        "It adds a given norm N to an existing, conflictfree normative state Δ, obtaining a resulting new normative state Δ which is conflict-free, that is, its prohibitions are annotated with a set of conflict sets indicating which bindings for variables have to be avoided for conflicts not to take place. algorithm addNorm(N, Δ) begin 1 timestamp(N) 2 case N of 3 per(¯I): Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 4 prh(I): if N ∈ Δ s.t. conflict(N, N , σ) then Δ := Δ 5 else Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 6 prh(¯I): 7 begin 8 Σ := ∅ 9 for each N ∈ Δ do 10 if conflict(N, N , σ) then Σ := Σ ∪ {σ} 11 Δ := Δ ∪ {N Σ} 12 end 13 obl(¯I): 14 begin 15 Δ1 := ∅; Δ2 := ∅ 16 for each (N Σ) ∈ Δ do 17 if N = prh(I) then 18 if conflict(N , N, σ) then Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 19 else nil 20 else 21 if conflict(N , N, σ) then 22 begin 23 Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 24 Δ2 := Δ2 ∪ {N (Σ ∪ {σ})} 25 end 26 Δ := (Δ − Δ1) ∪ Δ2 ∪ {N} 27 end 28 end case 29 return Δ end Figure 4: Algorithm to Preserve Conflict-Freedom The algorithm uses a case of structure to differentiate the different possibilities for a given norm N. Line 3 addresses the case when the given norm is a permission: N is simply added to Δ.",
        "Lines 4-5 address the case when we attempt to add a ground prohibition to a normative state: if it conflicts with any obligation, then it is discarded; otherwise it is added to the normative state.",
        "Lines 6-12 describe the situation when the normative position to be added is a nonground prohibition.",
        "In this case, the algorithm initialises Σ to an empty set and loops (line 9-10) through the norms N in the old normative state Δ.",
        "Upon finding one that conflicts with N, the algorithm updates Σ by adding the newly found conflict set σ to it (line 10).",
        "By looping through Δ, we are able to check any conflicts between the new prohibition and the existing obligations, adequately building the annotation Σ to be used when adding N to Δ in line 11.",

        "We make use of two initially empty, temporary sets, Δ1, Δ2.",
        "The algorithm loops through Δ (lines 16-25) picking up those annotated prohibitions N Σ which conflict with the new obligation.",
        "There are, however, two cases to deal with: the one when a ground The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 641 prohibition is found (line 17), and its exception, covering non-ground prohibitions (line 20).",
        "In both cases, the old prohibition is stored in Δ1 (lines 18 and 23) to be later removed from Δ (line 26).",
        "However, in the case of a nonground prohibition, the algorithm updates its annotation of conflict sets (line 24).",
        "The loop guarantees that an exhaustive (linear) search through a normative state takes place, checking if the new obligation is in conflict with any existing prohibitions, possibly updating the annotations of these conflicting prohibitions.",
        "In line 26 the algorithm builds the new updated Δ by removing the old prohibitions stored in Δ1 and adding the updated prohibitions stored in Δ2 (if any), as well as the new obligation N. Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations.",
        "The annotations can be empty, though: this is the case when we have a ground prohibition or a prohibition which does not unify/conflict with any obligation.",
        "Permissions do not affect our algorithm and they are appropriately dealt with (line 3).",
        "Any attempt to insert a ground prohibition which conflicts, yields the same normative state (line 4).",
        "When a new obligation is being added then the algorithm guarantees that all prohibitions are considered (lines 14-27), leading to the removal of conflicting ground prohibitions or the update of annotations of non-ground prohibitions.",
        "The algorithm always terminates: the loops are over a finite set Δ and the conflict checks and set operations always terminate.",
        "The complexity of the algorithm is linear: the set Δ is only examined once for each possible case of norm to be added.",
        "When managing normative states we may also need to remove normative positions.",
        "This is straightforward: permissions can be removed without any problems; annotated prohibitions can also be removed without further considerations; obligations, however, require some housekeeping.",
        "When an obligation is to be removed, we must check it against all annotated prohibitions in order to update their annotations.",
        "We apply the conflict check and obtain a unifier, then remove this unifier from the prohibitions annotation.",
        "We invoke the removal algorithm as removeNorm(N, Δ): it returns a new normative state Δ in which N has been removed, with possible alterations to other normative positions as explained. 6.2 Enactment of a Normative Structure The enactment of a normative structure amounts to the parallel, distributed execution of normative scenes and normative transitions.",
        "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
        "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
        "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
        "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
        "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
        "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
        "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
        "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
        "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
        "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
        "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
        "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
        "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
        "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
        "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
        "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
        "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
        "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
        "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
        "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
        "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
        "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
        "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
        "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
        "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
        "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
        "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
        "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
        "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
        "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",
        "The normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets.",
        "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
        "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
        "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
        "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
        "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
        "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
        "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
        "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
        "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
        "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
        "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
        "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
        "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
        "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
        "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
        "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",
        "The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",

        "Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29].",
        "Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]).",
        "Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes.",

        "Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto.",
        "Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega.",
        "Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes.",

        "Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad.",
        "Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado.",

        "Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado.",
        "El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría.",

        "La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo.",
        "Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos.",
        "Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14].",
        "Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas.",
        "Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos.",
        "Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23].",
        "La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas.",
        "Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes.",
        "Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad.",
        "En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa.",
        "Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1.",
        "Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo,",
        "X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos.",
        "Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función.",
        "Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2.",
        "Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos.",
        "El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ.",
        "Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3.",
        "Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades.",
        "El Sexto Internacional.",
        "Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo.",
        "El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10).",
        "A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres).",
        "En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar.",
        "Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base.",
        "Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4.",
        "Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5.",
        "Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud.",
        "Ten en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa Δs evoluciona con el tiempo.",
        "Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas.",
        "Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás.",
        "Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo.",
        "Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente.",
        "Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6.",
        "Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una posición normativa (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo.",
        "Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19].",
        "Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas.",
        "En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9].",
        "Definición 7.",
        "Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una regla de transición normativa.",
        "Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas.",
        "Esta capa se representa como un grafo bipartito al que llamamos estructura normativa.",
        "Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas.",
        "Definición 8.",
        "Una estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout.",
        "Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas.",
        "Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1.",
        "Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2.",
        "La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb.",
        "Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente.",
        "Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1.",
        "Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativas describiendo cómo una regla cambia una escena normativa de una estructura normativa existente, dando como resultado una nueva estructura normativa.",
        "Cada regla se activa una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes.",
        "Una fórmula atómica (es decir, una enunciación o una posición normativa) se cumple si es unificable con una enunciación o posición normativa que pertenece al estado de la escena normativa correspondiente.",
        "Cada vez que se activa una regla, se lleva a cabo el comando normativo especificado en el lado derecho de esa regla, con la intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa del estado de la escena normativa correspondiente.",
        "Sin embargo, la adición no es incondicional ya que pueden surgir conflictos.",
        "Este tema será tratado en las Secciones 4 y 6.1. 638 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional.",
        "En nuestro ejemplo en curso tenemos la siguiente regla de transición normativa ejemplar: \"pago: obl(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)), pago: utt(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)) « entrega: add(obl(informar(Y, wm, X, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)))\". Es decir, durante la actividad de pago, una obligación en el cliente X de informar al contador Y sobre el pago P del artículo Z en el tiempo T y la correspondiente declaración que cumple con esta obligación permite el flujo de una norma hacia la actividad de entrega.",
        "La norma es una obligación para el agente Y (en este caso asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) de enviar un mensaje al cliente X informando que el artículo Z ha sido entregado.",
        "Mostramos en la Figura 2 una representación diagramática de cómo se relacionan las actividades y una estructura normativa: Nivel Normativo Contrato de Entrega de Pago Salida Registro Pago Entrega Negociación Nivel de Coordinación Contrato nt Figura 2: Actividades y Estructura Normativa A medida que se emiten enunciados ilocucionarios durante las actividades, surgen posiciones normativas.",
        "Las expresiones y posiciones normativas se combinan en reglas de transición, causando el flujo de posiciones normativas entre escenas normativas.",
        "La conexión entre los dos niveles se describe en la Sección 6.2.4.",
        "DEFINICIÓN DE CONFLICTO Los términos conflicto deóntico e inconsistencia deóntica se han utilizado indistintamente en la literatura.",
        "Sin embargo, en este documento adoptamos la perspectiva de [7] en la que los autores sugieren que surge una inconsistencia deontológica cuando una acción es simultáneamente permitida y prohibida, ya que una permisión puede no ser llevada a cabo, por lo que no se produce un conflicto real.",
        "Las situaciones en las que una acción está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida son, sin embargo, conflictos deontológicos, ya que tanto las obligaciones como las prohibiciones influyen en los comportamientos de manera conflictiva.",
        "El contenido de las posiciones normativas en este documento son actos ilocutivos.",
        "Por lo tanto, surge un conflicto normativo cuando una ilocución está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida.",
        "Proponemos utilizar la noción estándar de unificación [9] para detectar cuándo se superponen una prohibición y un permiso.",
        "Por ejemplo, una obligación obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) y una prohibición prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T)) están en conflicto ya que se unifican bajo σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T}.",
        "Capturamos formalmente esta noción: Def. 9.",
        "Un conflicto (deóntico) surge entre dos posiciones normativas N y N bajo una sustitución σ, denotado como conflict(N, N, σ), si y solo si N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I) y unificar(¯I, ¯I, σ).",
        "Es decir, una prohibición y una obligación están en conflicto si, y solo si, sus ilocuciones se unifican bajo σ.",
        "La sustitución σ, llamada aquí el conjunto de conflictos, unifica a los agentes, roles y fórmulas atómicas.",
        "Suponemos que unificar es una implementación adecuada de un algoritmo de unificación que i) siempre termina (posiblemente fallando, si no se puede encontrar un unificador); ii) es correcto; y iii) tiene complejidad computacional lineal.",
        "Las inconsistencias causadas por la misma ilocución siendo simultáneamente permitida y prohibida pueden ser formalizadas de manera similar.",
        "En este artículo nos enfocamos en conflictos de prohibición/obligación, pero la maquinaria computacional introducida en la Sección 6.1 también puede ser utilizada para detectar inconsistencias de prohibición/permiso, si sustituimos la modalidad obl por per. 5.",
        "FORMALIZANDO LA LIBERTAD DE CONFLICTOS En esta sección introducimos algunos conocimientos previos sobre las CPN asumiendo una comprensión básica de las Redes de Petri ordinarias.",
        "Para detalles técnicos remitimos al lector a [16].",

        "En nuestra opinión, una semántica de verdadera concurrencia es más fácil de trabajar porque es la forma en que imaginamos que debe ser la conexión entre el nivel de coordinación y el nivel normativo de un sistema multiagente.",
        "Por otro lado, los lenguajes de programación funcional utilizados por las CPNs proporcionan los elementos básicos para la definición de tipos de datos y la manipulación de sus valores de datos.",
        "Por lo tanto, podemos traducir fácilmente expresiones de una estructura normativa.",
        "Por último, pero no menos importante, las CPN tienen una semántica bien definida que define de manera inequívoca el comportamiento de cada CPN.",
        "Además, las CPNs cuentan con una gran cantidad de métodos y herramientas de análisis formales mediante los cuales se pueden demostrar propiedades de las CPNs.",
        "En resumen, las CPNs nos proporcionan todas las características necesarias para razonar formalmente sobre estructuras normativas siempre que se proporcione un mapeo adecuado.",
        "De acuerdo con las redes de Petri, los estados de una CPN se representan mediante lugares.",
        "Pero a diferencia de las Redes de Petri, cada lugar tiene un tipo de dato asociado que determina el tipo de datos que el lugar puede contener.",

        "Los permisos no afectan nuestro algoritmo y se manejan adecuadamente (línea 3).",
        "Cualquier intento de insertar una prohibición de base que entre en conflicto, produce el mismo estado normativo (línea 4).",
        "Cuando se agrega una nueva obligación, el algoritmo garantiza que se consideren todas las prohibiciones (líneas 14-27), lo que lleva a la eliminación de prohibiciones fundamentales conflictivas o la actualización de anotaciones de prohibiciones no fundamentales.",
        "El algoritmo siempre termina: los bucles están sobre un conjunto finito Δ y las verificaciones de conflictos y operaciones de conjunto siempre terminan.",
        "La complejidad del algoritmo es lineal: el conjunto Δ solo se examina una vez para cada posible caso de norma que se agregue.",
        "Al gestionar estados normativos, también puede ser necesario eliminar posiciones normativas.",

        "Invocamos el algoritmo de eliminación como removeNorm(N, Δ): devuelve un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que se ha eliminado N, con posibles alteraciones en otras posiciones normativas como se explica. 6.2 Promulgación de una Estructura Normativa La promulgación de una estructura normativa implica la ejecución paralela y distribuida de escenas normativas y transiciones normativas.",
        "Con fines ilustrativos, a continuación describiremos la interacción entre las escenas normativas de pago y entrega y la transición normativa nt que las vincula en la mitad superior de la figura 2.",
        "Con este objetivo, considere por ejemplo que obl(inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpago y que Δentrega sostiene prh(inform(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)).",
        "Tales estados indican que el cliente Jules está obligado a pagar £400 por 350 kg de cobre al contador Rod de acuerdo con la escena normativa de pago, mientras que Rod, asumiendo el papel de gerente de almacén en esta ocasión, tiene prohibido entregar cualquier cosa al cliente Jules de acuerdo con la escena normativa de entrega.",
        "Para cada escena normativa, el proceso de promulgación es el siguiente.",
        "En primer lugar, procesa su cola de mensajes entrantes que contiene tres tipos de mensajes: enunciados de la actividad a la que está vinculado; y comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar posiciones normativas.",
        "Por ejemplo, en nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago recopila la ilocución I = utt((inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), 35)) que representa al cliente Jules pendiente de pago por cobre (a través de la flecha A en la figura 2).",
        "Las expresiones son marcadas con la hora y luego se agregan al estado normativo.",
        "Tendríamos Δpago = Δpago ∪ {I}, en nuestro ejemplo.",
        "Al recibir comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar una posición normativa, la escena normativa invoca el algoritmo de adición o eliminación correspondiente descrito en la Sección 6.1.",
        "En segundo lugar, la escena normativa reconoce su cambio de estado al enviar un mensaje de activación a cada transición normativa saliente a la que está conectada.",
        "En nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago estaría señalando su cambio de estado a la transición normativa nt.",
        "Para las transiciones normativas, el proceso funciona de manera diferente.",
        "Debido a que cada transición normativa controla la operación de una regla única, al recibir un mensaje de activación, sondea cada escena normativa entrante en busca de sustituciones para los esquemas ilocucionales relevantes en el LHS de su regla.",
        "En nuestro ejemplo, nt (siendo responsable de la regla descrita en la Sección 3.4), sondearía la escena normativa de pagos (a través de la flecha B) en busca de sustituciones.",
        "Al recibir respuestas de ellos (en forma de conjuntos de sustituciones junto con marcas de tiempo), se deben unificar las sustituciones de cada una de estas escenas normativas.",
        "Para cada unificación que encuentra, la regla se activa, y por lo tanto se envía el comando normativo correspondiente a la escena normativa de salida.",
        "La transición normativa luego lleva un registro del mensaje de activación que envió y de los sellos de tiempo de las posiciones normativas que desencadenaron la activación.",
        "Esto se hace para asegurar que las mismas posiciones normativas en el LHS de una regla solo activen su disparo una vez.",
        "En nuestro ejemplo, nt estaría recibiendo σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} de la escena normativa de pago.",
        "Dado que las sustituciones en σ unifican con la regla nts, la regla se activa y se envía el comando normativo adicionar(entrega : obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350), T)) a la escena normativa de entrega para obligar a Rod a entregar al cliente Jules 350 kg de cobre.",
        "Después de eso, la escena normativa de entrega invocaría el algoritmo addNorm de la figura 4 con Δentrega y N = obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350)) como argumentos. 7.",
        "TRABAJO RELACIONADO Y CONCLUSIONES Nuestras contribuciones en este artículo son triples.",
        "En primer lugar, presentamos un enfoque para la gestión y razonamiento sobre normas de manera distribuida.",
        "Hasta donde sabemos, hay poco trabajo publicado en esta dirección.",
        "En [8, 21], se presentan dos idiomas para la aplicación distribuida de normas en MAS.",
        "Sin embargo, en ambos trabajos, cada agente tiene una interfaz de mensajes local que reenvía mensajes legales de acuerdo con un conjunto de normas.",
        "Dado que estas interfaces son locales para cada agente, las normas solo pueden expresarse en términos de acciones de ese agente.",
        "Esta es una seria desventaja, por ejemplo, cuando se necesita activar una obligación hacia un agente debido a un mensaje de otro.",
        "La segunda contribución es la propuesta de una estructura normativa.",
        "La noción es fructífera porque permite la separación de preocupaciones normativas y procedimentales.",

        "Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) de tokens en Redes de Petri de Colores.",
        "Esa similitud sugiere fácilmente un mapeo entre ambos, y proporciona fundamentos para un tratamiento analítico conveniente de la estructura normativa, en general, y la complejidad de la detección de conflictos, en particular.",
        "La idea de modelar interacciones (en forma de conversaciones) a través de Redes de Petri ha sido investigada en [18], donde el medio de interacción y los agentes individuales son modelados como subredes de CPN que posteriormente se combinan para su análisis.",
        "En [5], las conversaciones se diseñan y analizan primero a nivel de CPNs y luego se traducen a protocolos.",
        "Lin et al. [20] mapean los esquemas de conversación a CPNs.",
        "Hasta donde sabemos, el uso de esta representación en el apoyo a la detección de conflictos en MAS regulados no ha sido reportado en otro lugar.",
        "Finalmente, presentamos un mecanismo distribuido para resolver conflictos normativos.",
        "Sartor [25] aborda los conflictos normativos desde el punto de vista de la teoría legal y sugiere una forma de ordenar las normas involucradas.",
        "Su idea se implementa en [12] pero requiere un recurso central para el mantenimiento de la norma.",
        "El enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos es una adaptación y extensión del trabajo sobre grafos de instanciación reportado en [17] y un algoritmo relacionado en [27].",
        "El algoritmo presentado en el artículo actual se puede utilizar para gestionar estados normativos de forma distribuida: escenas normativas que ocurren en paralelo tienen un estado normativo asociado Δ al cual el algoritmo se aplica de forma independiente cada vez que se introduce una nueva norma.",
        "Estas tres contribuciones que presentamos en este artículo abren muchas posibilidades para trabajos futuros.",
        "Deberíamos mencionar primero que, como estrategia general, estamos trabajando en una generalización de la noción de estructura normativa para hacerla operar con diferentes modelos de coordinación, con un contenido deóntico más rico y sobre diferentes realizaciones computacionales de MAS regulados.",
        "Como primer paso en esta dirección, estamos aprovechando el desacoplamiento entre los protocolos de interacción y la orientación normativa declarativa que la estructura normativa pone a disposición, para proporcionar una capa normativa para las instituciones electrónicas (como se define en [1]).",
        "Esperamos que dicho acoplamiento dote a las instituciones electrónicas de un entorno normativo más flexible y expresivo.",
        "Además, queremos ampliar nuestro modelo en varias direcciones: (1) para manejar la negación y restricciones como parte del lenguaje normativo, y en particular la noción de tiempo; (2) para acomodar múltiples autoridades normativas jerárquicas basadas en roles, siguiendo las líneas de Cholvy y Cuppens [3] y las relaciones de poder sugeridas por Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) para capturar en el algoritmo de resolución de conflictos diferentes semánticas relacionadas con las nociones deónticas mediante el apoyo a diferentes axiomatizaciones (por ejemplo, la fuerza relativa de la prohibición versus la obligación, nociones deónticas por defecto, inconsistencias deónticas).",
        "En el lado teórico, pretendemos utilizar técnicas de análisis de CPNs para caracterizar clases de CPNs (por ejemplo, acíclicos, simétricos, etc.) correspondientes a familias de Estructuras Normativas que son susceptibles a la detección de conflictos offline manejables.",

                "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
                "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",

                "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
                "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",

                "During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution.",

                "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request.",
                "Note that the state of a normative scene Δs evolves over time.",
                "These normative scenes are connected to one another via normative transitions that specify how utterances and normative positions in one scene affect other normative scenes.",
                "As mentioned above, activities are not independent since illocutions uttered in some of them may have an effect on other ones.",
                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
                "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",
                "Our transition rules are thus defined: Def. 6.",
                "A normative transition rule R is of the form: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) where ¯I is an illocution schema, N is a normative position (i.e. permission, prohibition or obligation), ids is an identifier for activity s and C is a normative command.",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo.

Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un <br>algoritmo</br> manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este <br>algoritmo</br> es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un <br>algoritmo</br> para la resolución de conflictos. ",

                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the <br>activity</br> it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",

                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias <br>actividad</br>es y cambiar de una <br>actividad</br> a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una <br>actividad</br> pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una <br>actividad</br>. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). ",

                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un <br>escenario</br> que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un <br>escenario</br> de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este <br>escenario</br>, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este <br>escenario</br> para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro <br>escenario</br> podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud.

[2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una <br>posición normativa</br> la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud. Ten en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa Δs evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás. Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo. Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra <br>posición normativa</br>, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6. Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una <br>posición normativa</br> (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Definición 7. Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una regla de transición normativa. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un grafo bipartito al que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas. Definición 8. Una estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout. Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una <br>posición normativa</br> utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1. Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativas describiendo cómo una regla cambia una escena normativa de una estructura normativa existente, dando como resultado una nueva estructura normativa. Cada regla se activa una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes. Una fórmula atómica (es decir, una enunciación o una <br>posición normativa</br>) se cumple si es unificable con una enunciación o <br>posición normativa</br> que pertenece al estado de la escena normativa correspondiente.

                "For instance, the sellers obligation above must flow (or be propagated) from a negotiation activity to a delivery activity.",
                "Since in an open, regulated MAS one cannot embed normative aspects into the agents design, we adopt the view that the MAS should be supplemented with a separate set of norms that further regulates the behaviour of participating agents.",

                "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
                "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",

                "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
                "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",

                "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s.

                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
                "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given <br>protocol</br> (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",

[2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un <br>protocolo</br> de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un <br>protocolo</br> de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros <br>protocolo</br>s. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un <br>protocolo</br> pueden tener consecuencias para otros <br>protocolo</br>s. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un <br>protocolo</br> de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un <br>protocolo</br>, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. ",

                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming <br>normative scene</br> for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment <br>normative scene</br> (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output <br>normative scene</br>.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment <br>normative scene</br>.",

                "After that, the delivery <br>normative scene</br> would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",

                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos.

Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de <br>escena normativa</br>, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una <br>escena normativa</br> es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la <br>escena normativa</br> s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud. Ten en cuenta que el estado de una <br>escena normativa</br> Δs evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás. Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo. Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6. Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una posición normativa (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Definición 7. Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una regla de transición normativa. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un grafo bipartito al que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas. Definición 8. Una estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout. Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1. Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativas describiendo cómo una regla cambia una <br>escena normativa</br> de una estructura normativa existente, dando como resultado una nueva estructura normativa. Cada regla se activa una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes. Una fórmula atómica (es decir, una enunciación o una posición normativa) se cumple si es unificable con una enunciación o posición normativa que pertenece al estado de la <br>escena normativa</br> correspondiente.

                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",

                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",

                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",

                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida.

Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, <br>regla de transición normativa</br> y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud. Ten en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa Δs evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás. Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo. Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6. Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una <br>posición normativa</br> (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Definición 7. Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una <br>regla de transición normativa</br>. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un grafo bipartito al que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas. Definición 8. Una estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout. Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una <br>regla de transición normativa</br> etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la <br>regla de transición normativa</br> en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la <br>regla de transición normativa</br> en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1.

                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",

                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",

                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",

                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a <br>normative structure</br>.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",

                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the <br>normative structure</br>, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of <br>normative structure</br> to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the <br>normative structure</br> makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la <br>Estructura Normativa</br> (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado <br>Estructura Normativa</br> (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de <br>estructura normativa</br>. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de <br>estructura normativa</br> e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3.

                "We focus on an expressive class of MASs in which interaction is carried out by means of illocutionary speech acts exchanged among participating agents: Def. 3.",
                "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",

                "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s.

                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
                "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",
                "Our transition rules are thus defined: Def. 6.",
                "A normative transition rule R is of the form: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) where ¯I is an illocution schema, N is a normative position (i.e. permission, prohibition or obligation), ids is an identifier for activity s and C is a normative command.",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud. Ten en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa Δs evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás. Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo. Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6. Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una posición normativa (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Definición 7. Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una regla de transición normativa. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un <br>grafo bipartito</br> al que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas. Definición 8. Una estructura normativa es un <br>grafo bipartito</br> etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout. Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1. Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativas describiendo cómo una regla cambia una escena normativa de una estructura normativa existente, dando como resultado una nueva estructura normativa. Cada regla se activa una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes. Una fórmula atómica (es decir, una enunciación o una posición normativa) se cumple si es unificable con una enunciación o posición normativa que pertenece al estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Cada vez que se activa una regla, se lleva a cabo el comando normativo especificado en el lado derecho de esa regla, con la intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa del estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Sin embargo, la adición no es incondicional ya que pueden surgir conflictos. Este tema será tratado en las Secciones 4 y 6.1. 638 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. En nuestro ejemplo en curso tenemos la siguiente regla de transición normativa ejemplar: \"pago: obl(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)), pago: utt(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)) « entrega: add(obl(informar(Y, wm, X, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)))\". Es decir, durante la actividad de pago, una obligación en el cliente X de informar al contador Y sobre el pago P del artículo Z en el tiempo T y la correspondiente declaración que cumple con esta obligación permite el flujo de una norma hacia la actividad de entrega. La norma es una obligación para el agente Y (en este caso asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) de enviar un mensaje al cliente X informando que el artículo Z ha sido entregado. Mostramos en la Figura 2 una representación diagramática de cómo se relacionan las actividades y una estructura normativa: Nivel Normativo Contrato de Entrega de Pago Salida Registro Pago Entrega Negociación Nivel de Coordinación Contrato nt Figura 2: Actividades y Estructura Normativa A medida que se emiten enunciados ilocucionarios durante las actividades, surgen posiciones normativas. Las expresiones y posiciones normativas se combinan en reglas de transición, causando el flujo de posiciones normativas entre escenas normativas. La conexión entre los dos niveles se describe en la Sección 6.2.4. DEFINICIÓN DE CONFLICTO Los términos conflicto deóntico e inconsistencia deóntica se han utilizado indistintamente en la literatura. Sin embargo, en este documento adoptamos la perspectiva de [7] en la que los autores sugieren que surge una inconsistencia deontológica cuando una acción es simultáneamente permitida y prohibida, ya que una permisión puede no ser llevada a cabo, por lo que no se produce un conflicto real. Las situaciones en las que una acción está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida son, sin embargo, conflictos deontológicos, ya que tanto las obligaciones como las prohibiciones influyen en los comportamientos de manera conflictiva. El contenido de las posiciones normativas en este documento son actos ilocutivos. Por lo tanto, surge un conflicto normativo cuando una ilocución está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida. Proponemos utilizar la noción estándar de unificación [9] para detectar cuándo se superponen una prohibición y un permiso. Por ejemplo, una obligación obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) y una prohibición prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T)) están en conflicto ya que se unifican bajo σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T}. Capturamos formalmente esta noción: Def. 9. Un conflicto (deóntico) surge entre dos posiciones normativas N y N bajo una sustitución σ, denotado como conflict(N, N, σ), si y solo si N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I) y unificar(¯I, ¯I, σ). Es decir, una prohibición y una obligación están en conflicto si, y solo si, sus ilocuciones se unifican bajo σ. La sustitución σ, llamada aquí el conjunto de conflictos, unifica a los agentes, roles y fórmulas atómicas. Suponemos que unificar es una implementación adecuada de un algoritmo de unificación que i) siempre termina (posiblemente fallando, si no se puede encontrar un unificador); ii) es correcto; y iii) tiene complejidad computacional lineal. Las inconsistencias causadas por la misma ilocución siendo simultáneamente permitida y prohibida pueden ser formalizadas de manera similar. En este artículo nos enfocamos en conflictos de prohibición/obligación, pero la maquinaria computacional introducida en la Sección 6.1 también puede ser utilizada para detectar inconsistencias de prohibición/permiso, si sustituimos la modalidad obl por per. 5. FORMALIZANDO LA LIBERTAD DE CONFLICTOS En esta sección introducimos algunos conocimientos previos sobre las CPN asumiendo una comprensión básica de las Redes de Petri ordinarias. Para detalles técnicos remitimos al lector a [16]. Luego mapeamos los NSs a los CPNs y analizamos sus propiedades. Las CPNs combinan la potencia de las redes de Petri con la potencia de los lenguajes de programación funcional. Por un lado, las redes de Petri proporcionan los elementos básicos para la descripción de la sincronización de procesos concurrentes. Como se observó en [16], las CPNs tienen una semántica que se basa en la concurrencia verdadera en lugar de la interlección. En nuestra opinión, una semántica de verdadera concurrencia es más fácil de trabajar porque es la forma en que imaginamos que debe ser la conexión entre el nivel de coordinación y el nivel normativo de un sistema multiagente. Por otro lado, los lenguajes de programación funcional utilizados por las CPNs proporcionan los elementos básicos para la definición de tipos de datos y la manipulación de sus valores de datos. Por lo tanto, podemos traducir fácilmente expresiones de una estructura normativa. Por último, pero no menos importante, las CPN tienen una semántica bien definida que define de manera inequívoca el comportamiento de cada CPN. Además, las CPNs cuentan con una gran cantidad de métodos y herramientas de análisis formales mediante los cuales se pueden demostrar propiedades de las CPNs. En resumen, las CPNs nos proporcionan todas las características necesarias para razonar formalmente sobre estructuras normativas siempre que se proporcione un mapeo adecuado. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri, los estados de una CPN se representan mediante lugares. Pero a diferencia de las Redes de Petri, cada lugar tiene un tipo de dato asociado que determina el tipo de datos que el lugar puede contener. Un estado de una CPN se llama marcado. Consiste en una serie de fichas colocadas en los lugares individuales. Cada token lleva consigo un valor de datos que tiene el tipo del lugar correspondiente. En general, un lugar puede contener dos o más fichas con el mismo valor de datos. Por lo tanto, una marca de una CPN es una función que asigna a cada plaza un multiconjunto de fichas del tipo correcto. Uno a menudo se refiere a los valores de los tokens como colores de tokens y también se refiere a los tipos de datos como conjuntos de colores. Los tipos de una CPN pueden ser arbitrariamente complejos. Las acciones en una CPN se representan mediante transiciones. Un arco entrante en una transición desde un lugar indica que la transición puede eliminar fichas del lugar correspondiente, mientras que un arco saliente indica que la transición puede agregar fichas. El número exacto de tokens y sus valores de datos son determinados por las expresiones de arco, las cuales están codificadas utilizando el lenguaje de programación elegido para la CPN. Una transición está habilitada en una CPN si y solo si el multi-conjunto (o bolsa) 2 A es una extensión de la noción de conjunto, permitiendo la posibilidad de múltiples apariciones del mismo elemento. El Sexto Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), 639 variables en las expresiones de sus arcos entrantes están vinculadas a algún valor (cada uno de estos vínculos se denomina elemento de vinculación). Si es así, la transición puede ocurrir al eliminar fichas de sus lugares de entrada y agregar fichas a sus lugares de salida. Además de las expresiones de arco, es posible adjuntar una expresión de guardia booleana (con variables) a cada transición. Al juntar todos los elementos anteriores, obtenemos una definición formal de CPN que se empleará más adelante con fines de mapeo. Definición 10. Un CPN es una tupla Σ, P, T, A, N, C, G, E, I donde: (i) Σ es un conjunto finito de tipos no vacíos, también llamados conjuntos de colores; (ii) P es un conjunto finito de lugares; (iii) T es un conjunto finito de transiciones; (iv) A es un conjunto finito de arcos; (v) N es una función de nodo definida de A en P × T ∪ T × P; (vi) C es una función de color de P en Σ; (vii) G es una función de guarda de T en expresiones; (viii) E es una función de expresión de arco de A en expresiones; (ix) I es una función de inicialización de P en expresiones cerradas; Nótese que la explicación informal de las reglas de habilitación y ocurrencia proporcionadas anteriormente sienta las bases para comprender el comportamiento de un CPN. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri ordinarias, el comportamiento concurrente de una CPN se basa en la noción de paso. Formalmente, un paso es un multi-conjunto no vacío y finito sobre el conjunto de todos los elementos de enlace. Sea el paso S habilitado en una marcación M. Entonces, S puede ocurrir, cambiando la marcación M a M'. Además, decimos que la marca M es directamente alcanzable desde la marca M mediante la ocurrencia del paso S, y lo denotamos como M[S > M. Una secuencia de ocurrencias finitas es una secuencia finita de pasos y marcas: M1[S1 > M2... Mn[Sn > Mn+1 tal que n ∈ N y Mi[Si > Mi+1 ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. \n\n(Note: The original sentence seems to have a typo or missing information, as it is not complete or clear in its meaning.) El conjunto de todas las marcas posibles alcanzables para una red Net desde una marca M se llama su conjunto de alcanzabilidad, y se denota como R(Net, M). 5.1 Mapeo a Redes de Petri Coloreadas. Nuestra estructura normativa es un <br>grafo bipartito</br> etiquetado. Lo mismo es cierto para una Red de Petri de Colores. Estamos presentando un mapeo f de uno a otro, con el fin de proporcionar semántica para la estructura normativa y demostrar propiedades sobre ella utilizando resultados teóricos bien conocidos del trabajo en CPNs. El mapeo f hace uso de correspondencias entre escenas normativas y lugares de CPN, transiciones normativas y transiciones de CPN y finalmente, entre etiquetas de arco y expresiones de arco de CPN. S → P B → T Lin ∪ Lout → E El conjunto de tipos es el conjunto unitario que contiene el color NP (es decir, Σ = {NP}). Este tipo complejo está estructurado de la siguiente manera (usamos la sintaxis CPN-ML [4]): color NPT = con Obl | Per | Prh | NoMod color IP = con informar | declarar | ofrecer color UTT = registro illp: IP ag1, rol1, ag2, rol2: cadena contenido: cadena tiempo: entero color NP = registro modo: NPT ilocución: UTT Modelar las ilocuciones como normas sin modalidad (NoMod) es un truco formal que utilizamos para asegurar que las subredes puedan combinarse como se explica a continuación. Los arcos son mapeados casi directamente. A es un conjunto finito de arcos y N es una función de nodo, tal que ∀a ∈ A ∃a ∈ Ain ∪Aout. N(a) = a. La función de inicialización I se define como I(p) = Δs (∀s ∈ S donde p se obtiene de s usando el mapeo; recuerda que s = ids, Δs). Finalmente, la función de color C asigna el color NP a cada lugar: C(p) = NP (∀p ∈ P). No estamos haciendo uso de la función de guardia G. En trabajos futuros, esta función puede ser utilizada para modelar restricciones cuando ampliemos la expresividad de nuestro lenguaje normativo. 5.2 Propiedades de Estructuras Normativas Habiendo definido la asignación de estructuras normativas a Redes de Petri de Colores, ahora examinamos propiedades de las RPC que nos ayudan a comprender la complejidad de la detección de conflictos. Una pregunta que nos gustaría responder es si, en un momento dado, una estructura normativa dada está libre de conflictos. Una instantánea de una estructura normativa corresponde a una marca en la CPN mapeada. Definición 11. Dada una marcación Mi, esta marcación es libre de conflictos si ¬∃p ∈ P. ∃np1, np2 ∈ Mi(p) tal que np1.modo = Obl y np2.modo = Prh y np1.illoc y np2.illoc unifican bajo una sustitución válida. Otra pregunta interesante sería si surgirá un conflicto a partir de tal instantánea del sistema al propagar las posiciones normativas. Para responder a esta pregunta, primero traducimos la instantánea de la estructura normativa al CPN correspondiente y luego ejecutamos la secuencia finita de ocurrencias de marcas y pasos, verificando la ausencia de conflictos en cada marca a medida que avanzamos. Definición 12. Dada una marca Mi, una secuencia finita de ocurrencias Si, Si+1, ..., Sn se llama libre de conflictos, si y solo si Mi[Si > Mi+1 . . . Mn[Sn > Mn+1 y Mk es libre de conflictos para todo k tal que i ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Sin embargo, la pregunta principal que nos gustaría investigar es si una estructura normativa dada es resistente al conflicto, es decir, si los agentes que implementan el MAS son capaces de generar conflictos a través de sus acciones. Tan pronto como se incluye la posibilidad de acciones (o enunciados) de agentes autónomos, se pierde el determinismo. Habiendo mapeado la estructura normativa a un CPN, ahora agregamos modelos de CPN de las interacciones de los agentes. Cada forma de interacción de agentes (es decir, cada actividad) puede ser modelada utilizando CPNs siguiendo la línea de Cost et al. [5]. Estas CPN no determinísticas alimentan tokens en la CPN que modela la estructura normativa. Esto conlleva a la introducción de no determinismo en la CPN combinada. La mitad inferior de la figura 3 muestra parte de un modelo CPN de un protocolo de agente donde el arco denotado con 1 representa alguna enunciación de una ilocución por un agente. La transición objetivo de este arco, no solo mueve un token al siguiente estado de esta CPN, sino que también coloca un token en el lugar correspondiente a la escena normativa apropiada en el modelo CPN de la estructura normativa (a través del arco 2). La transición 3 finalmente pudo propagar ese token en forma de obligación, por ejemplo. Por lo tanto, a partir de una marca dada, son posibles muchas secuencias de ocurrencia diferentes dependiendo de las acciones de los agentes. Hacemos uso del conjunto de alcanzabilidad R para definir una situación en la que los agentes no pueden causar conflictos. 640 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) Figura 3: Construyendo la CPN combinada Def. 13. Dado una red N, una marcación M es resistente a conflictos si y solo si todas las marcaciones en R(N,M) son libres de conflictos. Verificar la libertad de conflicto de una marca se puede hacer en tiempo polinómico al revisar todos los lugares de la CPN en busca de fichas en conflicto. La libertad de conflicto de una secuencia de ocurrencias en la CPN que representa la estructura normativa también se puede lograr en tiempo polinómico, ya que esta secuencia es determinista dado un instante. Ya sea que una estructura normativa esté diseñada de manera segura corresponde a verificar la resistencia al conflicto de la marca inicial M0. Ahora, verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una marca se convierte en una tarea muy difícil. Corresponde al problema de alcanzabilidad en una CPN: ¿se puede alcanzar un estado o lograr una marcación que contenga un conflicto? Este problema de alcanzabilidad se sabe que es NP-completo para las Redes de Petri ordinarias [22] y dado que las CPNs son funcionalmente idénticas, no podemos esperar verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una estructura normativa fuera de línea en una cantidad razonable de tiempo. Por lo tanto, se necesitan mecanismos distribuidos en tiempo de ejecución para garantizar que una estructura normativa mantenga la consistencia. Presentamos un mecanismo de este tipo en la siguiente sección. 6. Una vez que se ha detectado un conflicto (según se define en la Sección 4), proponemos emplear el unificador para resolver el conflicto. En nuestro ejemplo, si las variables en prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) no obtienen los valores especificados en la sustitución σ, entonces no habrá un conflicto. Sin embargo, en lugar de calcular el conjunto complementario de una sustitución (que puede ser un conjunto infinito), proponemos anotar la prohibición con el unificador mismo y usarlo para determinar qué variables no pueden ser en futuras unificaciones para evitar un conflicto. Por lo tanto, designamos las prohibiciones anotadas como prh(¯I) Σ, donde Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, es un conjunto de unificadores. Las normas anotadas se interpretan como construcciones deónticas con influencias limitadas, es decir, su efecto (sobre agentes, roles e ilocuciones) ha sido restringido por el conjunto Σ de unificadores. Una prohibición puede estar en conflicto con varias obligaciones en una escena normativa dada s = id, Δ y necesitamos registrar (y posiblemente evitar) todos estos conflictos. A continuación definimos un algoritmo que garantiza que una posición normativa se agregará a una escena normativa de tal manera que no cause conflictos. Aunque proponemos reducir las prohibiciones, la misma maquinaria puede utilizarse para definir la reducción de obligaciones en su lugar. Estas políticas diferentes dependen de la semántica deontológica prevista y de los requisitos de los sistemas abordados. Por ejemplo, algunas MASs pueden requerir que sus agentes no actúen en presencia de conflictos, es decir, que la obligación debe ser limitada. 6.1 Resolución de Conflictos Proponemos una forma detallada de resolver conflictos normativos a través de la unificación. Detectamos la superposición de las influencias de las normas, es decir, cómo afectan el comportamiento de los agentes involucrados, y reducimos la influencia de la posición normativa, utilizando adecuadamente las anotaciones al verificar si la norma se aplica a las ilocuciones. El algoritmo mostrado en la Figura 4 representa cómo mantenemos un conjunto de normas libre de conflictos. Agrega una norma dada N a un estado normativo Δ existente y libre de conflictos, obteniendo un nuevo estado normativo resultante Δ que es libre de conflictos, es decir, sus prohibiciones están anotadas con un conjunto de conjuntos de conflictos que indican qué asignaciones para variables deben evitarse para que no ocurran conflictos. algoritmo addNorm(N, Δ) comienza 1 marca de tiempo(N) 2 caso N de 3 per(¯I): Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 4 prh(I): si N ∈ Δ tal que conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Δ := Δ 5 de lo contrario Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 6 prh(¯I): 7 comienza 8 Σ := ∅ 9 para cada N ∈ Δ hacer 10 si conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Σ := Σ ∪ {σ} 11 Δ := Δ ∪ {N Σ} 12 fin 13 obl(¯I): 14 comienza 15 Δ1 := ∅; Δ2 := ∅ 16 para cada (N Σ) ∈ Δ hacer 17 si N = prh(I) entonces 18 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 19 de lo contrario nulo 20 de lo contrario 21 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces 22 comienza 23 Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 24 Δ2 := Δ2 ∪ {N (Σ ∪ {σ})} 25 fin 26 Δ := (Δ − Δ1) ∪ Δ2 ∪ {N} 27 fin 28 fin caso 29 devolver Δ fin Figura 4: Algoritmo para Preservar la Libertad de Conflictos El algoritmo utiliza una estructura de caso para diferenciar las diferentes posibilidades para una norma dada N. La línea 3 aborda el caso en el que la norma dada es un permiso: N simplemente se agrega a Δ. Las líneas 4-5 abordan el caso en el que intentamos agregar una prohibición de base a un estado normativo: si entra en conflicto con alguna obligación, entonces se descarta; de lo contrario, se agrega al estado normativo. Las líneas 6-12 describen la situación cuando la posición normativa a añadir es una prohibición no fundamentada. En este caso, el algoritmo inicializa Σ como un conjunto vacío y recorre en bucle (línea 9-10) las normas N en el estado normativo anterior Δ. Al encontrar uno que entre en conflicto con N, el algoritmo actualiza Σ agregando el conjunto de conflictos recién encontrado σ a él (línea 10). Al recorrer Δ en un bucle, podemos verificar cualquier conflicto entre la nueva prohibición y las obligaciones existentes, construyendo adecuadamente la anotación Σ que se utilizará al agregar N a Δ en la línea 11. Las líneas 13-27 describen cómo una nueva obligación se adapta a un estado normativo existente. Hacemos uso de dos conjuntos temporales inicialmente vacíos, Δ1, Δ2. El algoritmo recorre Δ (líneas 16-25) recogiendo aquellas prohibiciones anotadas N Σ que entran en conflicto con la nueva obligación. Sin embargo, hay dos casos con los que tratar: uno cuando un terreno La Sexta Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se encuentra la prohibición 641 (línea 17) y su excepción, que abarca prohibiciones no fundamentadas (línea 20). En ambos casos, la antigua prohibición se almacena en Δ1 (líneas 18 y 23) para ser posteriormente eliminada de Δ (línea 26). Sin embargo, en el caso de una prohibición no basada en tierra, el algoritmo actualiza su anotación de conjuntos de conflictos (línea 24). El bucle garantiza que se realice una búsqueda exhaustiva (lineal) a través de un estado normativo, verificando si la nueva obligación entra en conflicto con alguna prohibición existente, posiblemente actualizando las anotaciones de estas prohibiciones conflictivas. En la línea 26, el algoritmo construye el nuevo Δ actualizado eliminando las antiguas prohibiciones almacenadas en Δ1 y agregando las prohibiciones actualizadas almacenadas en Δ2 (si las hay), así como la nueva obligación N. Nuestro algoritmo propuesto es correcto en el sentido de que, para una posición normativa N dada y un estado normativo Δ, proporciona un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que todas las prohibiciones tienen anotaciones que registran cómo se unifican con las obligaciones existentes. Las anotaciones pueden estar vacías, sin embargo, este es el caso cuando tenemos una prohibición de base o una prohibición que no unifica/conflicta con ninguna obligación. Los permisos no afectan nuestro algoritmo y se manejan adecuadamente (línea 3). Cualquier intento de insertar una prohibición de base que entre en conflicto, produce el mismo estado normativo (línea 4). Cuando se agrega una nueva obligación, el algoritmo garantiza que se consideren todas las prohibiciones (líneas 14-27), lo que lleva a la eliminación de prohibiciones fundamentales conflictivas o la actualización de anotaciones de prohibiciones no fundamentales. El algoritmo siempre termina: los bucles están sobre un conjunto finito Δ y las verificaciones de conflictos y operaciones de conjunto siempre terminan. La complejidad del algoritmo es lineal: el conjunto Δ solo se examina una vez para cada posible caso de norma que se agregue. Al gestionar estados normativos, también puede ser necesario eliminar posiciones normativas. Esto es sencillo: los permisos se pueden eliminar sin problemas; las prohibiciones anotadas también se pueden eliminar sin más consideraciones; sin embargo, las obligaciones requieren cierto mantenimiento. Cuando una obligación debe ser eliminada, debemos verificarla con todas las prohibiciones anotadas para actualizar sus anotaciones. Aplicamos la verificación de conflictos y obtenemos un unificador, luego eliminamos este unificador de la anotación de prohibiciones. Invocamos el algoritmo de eliminación como removeNorm(N, Δ): devuelve un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que se ha eliminado N, con posibles alteraciones en otras posiciones normativas como se explica. 6.2 Promulgación de una Estructura Normativa La promulgación de una estructura normativa implica la ejecución paralela y distribuida de escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Con fines ilustrativos, a continuación describiremos la interacción entre las escenas normativas de pago y entrega y la transición normativa nt que las vincula en la mitad superior de la figura 2. Con este objetivo, considere por ejemplo que obl(inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpago y que Δentrega sostiene prh(inform(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)). Tales estados indican que el cliente Jules está obligado a pagar £400 por 350 kg de cobre al contador Rod de acuerdo con la escena normativa de pago, mientras que Rod, asumiendo el papel de gerente de almacén en esta ocasión, tiene prohibido entregar cualquier cosa al cliente Jules de acuerdo con la escena normativa de entrega. Para cada escena normativa, el proceso de promulgación es el siguiente. En primer lugar, procesa su cola de mensajes entrantes que contiene tres tipos de mensajes: enunciados de la actividad a la que está vinculado; y comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar posiciones normativas. Por ejemplo, en nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago recopila la ilocución I = utt((inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), 35)) que representa al cliente Jules pendiente de pago por cobre (a través de la flecha A en la figura 2). Las expresiones son marcadas con la hora y luego se agregan al estado normativo. Tendríamos Δpago = Δpago ∪ {I}, en nuestro ejemplo. Al recibir comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar una posición normativa, la escena normativa invoca el algoritmo de adición o eliminación correspondiente descrito en la Sección 6.1. En segundo lugar, la escena normativa reconoce su cambio de estado al enviar un mensaje de activación a cada transición normativa saliente a la que está conectada. En nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago estaría señalando su cambio de estado a la transición normativa nt. Para las transiciones normativas, el proceso funciona de manera diferente. Debido a que cada transición normativa controla la operación de una regla única, al recibir un mensaje de activación, sondea cada escena normativa entrante en busca de sustituciones para los esquemas ilocucionales relevantes en el LHS de su regla. En nuestro ejemplo, nt (siendo responsable de la regla descrita en la Sección 3.4), sondearía la escena normativa de pagos (a través de la flecha B) en busca de sustituciones. Al recibir respuestas de ellos (en forma de conjuntos de sustituciones junto con marcas de tiempo), se deben unificar las sustituciones de cada una de estas escenas normativas. Para cada unificación que encuentra, la regla se activa, y por lo tanto se envía el comando normativo correspondiente a la escena normativa de salida. La transición normativa luego lleva un registro del mensaje de activación que envió y de los sellos de tiempo de las posiciones normativas que desencadenaron la activación. Esto se hace para asegurar que las mismas posiciones normativas en el LHS de una regla solo activen su disparo una vez. En nuestro ejemplo, nt estaría recibiendo σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} de la escena normativa de pago. Dado que las sustituciones en σ unifican con la regla nts, la regla se activa y se envía el comando normativo adicionar(entrega : obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350), T)) a la escena normativa de entrega para obligar a Rod a entregar al cliente Jules 350 kg de cobre. Después de eso, la escena normativa de entrega invocaría el algoritmo addNorm de la figura 4 con Δentrega y N = obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350)) como argumentos. 7. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Y CONCLUSIONES Nuestras contribuciones en este artículo son triples. En primer lugar, presentamos un enfoque para la gestión y razonamiento sobre normas de manera distribuida. Hasta donde sabemos, hay poco trabajo publicado en esta dirección. En [8, 21], se presentan dos idiomas para la aplicación distribuida de normas en MAS. Sin embargo, en ambos trabajos, cada agente tiene una interfaz de mensajes local que reenvía mensajes legales de acuerdo con un conjunto de normas. Dado que estas interfaces son locales para cada agente, las normas solo pueden expresarse en términos de acciones de ese agente. Esta es una seria desventaja, por ejemplo, cuando se necesita activar una obligación hacia un agente debido a un mensaje de otro. La segunda contribución es la propuesta de una estructura normativa. La noción es fructífera porque permite la separación de preocupaciones normativas y procedimentales. La estructura normativa que proponemos pone de manifiesto la similitud entre la propagación de posiciones normativas y la propagación 642 de la Sexta Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) de tokens en Redes de Petri de Colores. Esa similitud sugiere fácilmente un mapeo entre ambos, y proporciona fundamentos para un tratamiento analítico conveniente de la estructura normativa, en general, y la complejidad de la detección de conflictos, en particular. La idea de modelar interacciones (en forma de conversaciones) a través de Redes de Petri ha sido investigada en [18], donde el medio de interacción y los agentes individuales son modelados como subredes de CPN que posteriormente se combinan para su análisis. En [5], las conversaciones se diseñan y analizan primero a nivel de CPNs y luego se traducen a protocolos. Lin et al. [20] mapean los esquemas de conversación a CPNs. Hasta donde sabemos, el uso de esta representación en el apoyo a la detección de conflictos en MAS regulados no ha sido reportado en otro lugar. Finalmente, presentamos un mecanismo distribuido para resolver conflictos normativos. Sartor [25] aborda los conflictos normativos desde el punto de vista de la teoría legal y sugiere una forma de ordenar las normas involucradas. Su idea se implementa en [12] pero requiere un recurso central para el mantenimiento de la norma. El enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos es una adaptación y extensión del trabajo sobre grafos de instanciación reportado en [17] y un algoritmo relacionado en [27]. El algoritmo presentado en el artículo actual se puede utilizar para gestionar estados normativos de forma distribuida: escenas normativas que ocurren en paralelo tienen un estado normativo asociado Δ al cual el algoritmo se aplica de forma independiente cada vez que se introduce una nueva norma. Estas tres contribuciones que presentamos en este artículo abren muchas posibilidades para trabajos futuros. Deberíamos mencionar primero que, como estrategia general, estamos trabajando en una generalización de la noción de estructura normativa para hacerla operar con diferentes modelos de coordinación, con un contenido deóntico más rico y sobre diferentes realizaciones computacionales de MAS regulados. Como primer paso en esta dirección, estamos aprovechando el desacoplamiento entre los protocolos de interacción y la orientación normativa declarativa que la estructura normativa pone a disposición, para proporcionar una capa normativa para las instituciones electrónicas (como se define en [1]). Esperamos que dicho acoplamiento dote a las instituciones electrónicas de un entorno normativo más flexible y expresivo. Además, queremos ampliar nuestro modelo en varias direcciones: (1) para manejar la negación y restricciones como parte del lenguaje normativo, y en particular la noción de tiempo; (2) para acomodar múltiples autoridades normativas jerárquicas basadas en roles, siguiendo las líneas de Cholvy y Cuppens [3] y las relaciones de poder sugeridas por Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) para capturar en el algoritmo de resolución de conflictos diferentes semánticas relacionadas con las nociones deónticas mediante el apoyo a diferentes axiomatizaciones (por ejemplo, la fuerza relativa de la prohibición versus la obligación, nociones deónticas por defecto, inconsistencias deónticas). En el lado teórico, pretendemos utilizar técnicas de análisis de CPNs para caracterizar clases de CPNs (por ejemplo, acíclicos, simétricos, etc.) correspondientes a familias de Estructuras Normativas que son susceptibles a la detección de conflictos offline manejables. La combinación de estas técnicas junto con nuestros mecanismos en línea de resolución de conflictos tiene como objetivo dotar a los diseñadores de MAS con la capacidad de incorporar normas en sus sistemas de manera fundamentada.

                "For instance, the sellers obligation above must flow (or be propagated) from a negotiation activity to a delivery activity.",

                "These systems allow the structuring of knowledge into distinct formal theories and the definition of relationships between them.",
                "The relationships are expressed as bridge rules - deducibility of formulae in some contexts leads to the deduction of other formulae in other contexts.",
                "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
                "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",
                "We are concerned with the propagation and distribution of normative positions within a network of distributed, normative scenes as a consequence of agents actions.",
                "We take normative scenes to be sets of normative positions and utterances that are associated with an underlying interaction protocol corresponding to an activity.",
                "In this section, we first present a simple language capturing these aspects and formally introduce the notions of normative scene, normative transition rule and normative structure.",
                "We give the intended semantics of these rules and show how to control a MAS via norms in an example. 3.1 Basic Concepts The building blocks of our language are terms and atomic formulae: Def. 1.",
                "A term, denoted as t, is (i) any constant expressed using lowercase (with or without subscripts), e.g. a, b0, c or (ii) any variable expressed using uppercase (with or without subscripts), e.g.",
                "X, Y, Zb or (iii) any function f(t1, . . . , tn), where f is an n-ary function symbol and t1, .., tn are terms.",
                "Some examples of terms and functions are Credit, price or offer(bible, 30) being respectively a variable, a constant and a function.",
                "We will be making use of identifiers throughout the paper, which are constant terms and also need the following definition: Def. 2.",
                "An atomic formula is any construct p(t1, . . . , tn), where p is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1, . . . , tn are terms.",
                "The set of all atomic formulae is denoted as Δ.",
                "We focus on an expressive class of MASs in which interaction is carried out by means of illocutionary speech acts exchanged among participating agents: Def. 3.",
                "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",
                "The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 637 a set of illocutionary particles (e.g. inform, request, offer); ag, ag are agent identifiers; r, r are role identifiers; δ, an arbitrary ground term, is the content of the message, built from a shared content language; t ∈ N is a time stamp.",
                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
                "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",
                "In the description of a protocol, for instance, the precise values of the message exchanged can be left unspecified.",
                "During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution.",
                "We can thus define illocution schemata: Def. 4.",
                "An illocution schema ¯I is any atomic formula p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) in which some of the terms may either be variables or may contain variables. 3.2 Formal Definition of the Notion of NS We first define normative scenes as follows: Def. 5.",
                "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request.",
                "Note that the state of a normative scene Δs evolves over time.",
                "These normative scenes are connected to one another via normative transitions that specify how utterances and normative positions in one scene affect other normative scenes.",
                "As mentioned above, activities are not independent since illocutions uttered in some of them may have an effect on other ones.",
                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
                "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",
                "Our transition rules are thus defined: Def. 6.",
                "A normative transition rule R is of the form: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) where ¯I is an illocution schema, N is a normative position (i.e. permission, <br>prohibition</br> or obligation), ids is an identifier for activity s and C is a normative command.",
                "We endow our language with the usual semantics of rulebased languages [19].",
                "Rules map an existing normative structure to a new normative structure where only the state of the normative scenes change.",
                "In the definitions below we rely on the standard concept of substitution [9].",
                "Def. 7.",
                "A normative transition is a tuple b = idb, rb where idb is an identifier and rb is a normative transition rule.",
                "We are proposing to extend the notion of MAS, regulated by protocols, with an extra layer consisting of normative scenes and normative transitions.",
                "This layer is represented as a bi-partite graph that we term normative structure.",
                "A normative structure relates normative scenes and normative transitions specifying which normative positions are to be generated or removed in which normative scenes.",

                "Nodes is a set S∪B where S is a set of normative scenes and B is a set of normative transitions.",

                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",

                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",

                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of <br>prohibition</br> versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud. Ten en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa Δs evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás. Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo. Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6. Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una posición normativa (es decir, permiso, <br>prohibición</br> u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Definición 7. Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una regla de transición normativa. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un grafo bipartito al que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas. Definición 8. Una estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout. Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1. Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativas describiendo cómo una regla cambia una escena normativa de una estructura normativa existente, dando como resultado una nueva estructura normativa. Cada regla se activa una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes. Una fórmula atómica (es decir, una enunciación o una posición normativa) se cumple si es unificable con una enunciación o posición normativa que pertenece al estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Cada vez que se activa una regla, se lleva a cabo el comando normativo especificado en el lado derecho de esa regla, con la intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa del estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Sin embargo, la adición no es incondicional ya que pueden surgir conflictos. Este tema será tratado en las Secciones 4 y 6.1. 638 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. En nuestro ejemplo en curso tenemos la siguiente regla de transición normativa ejemplar: \"pago: obl(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)), pago: utt(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)) « entrega: add(obl(informar(Y, wm, X, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)))\". Es decir, durante la actividad de pago, una obligación en el cliente X de informar al contador Y sobre el pago P del artículo Z en el tiempo T y la correspondiente declaración que cumple con esta obligación permite el flujo de una norma hacia la actividad de entrega. La norma es una obligación para el agente Y (en este caso asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) de enviar un mensaje al cliente X informando que el artículo Z ha sido entregado. Mostramos en la Figura 2 una representación diagramática de cómo se relacionan las actividades y una estructura normativa: Nivel Normativo Contrato de Entrega de Pago Salida Registro Pago Entrega Negociación Nivel de Coordinación Contrato nt Figura 2: Actividades y Estructura Normativa A medida que se emiten enunciados ilocucionarios durante las actividades, surgen posiciones normativas. Las expresiones y posiciones normativas se combinan en reglas de transición, causando el flujo de posiciones normativas entre escenas normativas. La conexión entre los dos niveles se describe en la Sección 6.2.4. DEFINICIÓN DE CONFLICTO Los términos conflicto deóntico e inconsistencia deóntica se han utilizado indistintamente en la literatura. Sin embargo, en este documento adoptamos la perspectiva de [7] en la que los autores sugieren que surge una inconsistencia deontológica cuando una acción es simultáneamente permitida y prohibida, ya que una permisión puede no ser llevada a cabo, por lo que no se produce un conflicto real. Las situaciones en las que una acción está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida son, sin embargo, conflictos deontológicos, ya que tanto las obligaciones como las prohibiciones influyen en los comportamientos de manera conflictiva. El contenido de las posiciones normativas en este documento son actos ilocutivos. Por lo tanto, surge un conflicto normativo cuando una ilocución está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida. Proponemos utilizar la noción estándar de unificación [9] para detectar cuándo se superponen una <br>prohibición</br> y un permiso. Por ejemplo, una obligación obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) y una <br>prohibición</br> prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T)) están en conflicto ya que se unifican bajo σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T}. Capturamos formalmente esta noción: Def. 9. Un conflicto (deóntico) surge entre dos posiciones normativas N y N bajo una sustitución σ, denotado como conflict(N, N, σ), si y solo si N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I) y unificar(¯I, ¯I, σ). Es decir, una <br>prohibición</br> y una obligación están en conflicto si, y solo si, sus ilocuciones se unifican bajo σ. La sustitución σ, llamada aquí el conjunto de conflictos, unifica a los agentes, roles y fórmulas atómicas. Suponemos que unificar es una implementación adecuada de un algoritmo de unificación que i) siempre termina (posiblemente fallando, si no se puede encontrar un unificador); ii) es correcto; y iii) tiene complejidad computacional lineal. Las inconsistencias causadas por la misma ilocución siendo simultáneamente permitida y prohibida pueden ser formalizadas de manera similar. En este artículo nos enfocamos en conflictos de <br>prohibición</br>/obligación, pero la maquinaria computacional introducida en la Sección 6.1 también puede ser utilizada para detectar inconsistencias de <br>prohibición</br>/permiso, si sustituimos la modalidad obl por per. 5.

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",

Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations.",
                "The annotations can be empty, though: this is the case when we have a ground prohibition or a prohibition which does not unify/conflict with any obligation.",
                "Permissions do not affect our algorithm and they are appropriately dealt with (line 3).",
                "Any attempt to insert a ground prohibition which conflicts, yields the same normative state (line 4).",
                "When a new obligation is being added then the algorithm guarantees that all prohibitions are considered (lines 14-27), leading to the removal of conflicting ground prohibitions or the update of annotations of non-ground prohibitions.",
                "The algorithm always terminates: the loops are over a finite set Δ and the conflict checks and set operations always terminate.",
                "The complexity of the algorithm is linear: the set Δ is only examined once for each possible case of norm to be added.",
                "When managing normative states we may also need to remove normative positions.",
                "This is straightforward: permissions can be removed without any problems; annotated prohibitions can also be removed without further considerations; obligations, however, require some housekeeping.",
                "When an obligation is to be removed, we must check it against all annotated prohibitions in order to update their annotations.",
                "We apply the conflict check and obtain a unifier, then remove this unifier from the prohibitions annotation.",
                "We invoke the removal algorithm as removeNorm(N, Δ): it returns a new normative state Δ in which N has been removed, with possible alterations to other normative positions as explained. 6.2 Enactment of a Normative Structure The enactment of a normative structure amounts to the parallel, distributed execution of normative scenes and normative transitions.",
                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",

                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud. Ten en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa Δs evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás. Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo. Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6. Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una posición normativa (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Definición 7. Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una regla de transición normativa. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un grafo bipartito al que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas. Definición 8. Una estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout. Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1. Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativas describiendo cómo una regla cambia una escena normativa de una estructura normativa existente, dando como resultado una nueva estructura normativa. Cada regla se activa una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes. Una fórmula atómica (es decir, una enunciación o una posición normativa) se cumple si es unificable con una enunciación o posición normativa que pertenece al estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Cada vez que se activa una regla, se lleva a cabo el comando normativo especificado en el lado derecho de esa regla, con la intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa del estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Sin embargo, la adición no es incondicional ya que pueden surgir conflictos. Este tema será tratado en las Secciones 4 y 6.1. 638 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. En nuestro ejemplo en curso tenemos la siguiente regla de transición normativa ejemplar: \"pago: obl(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)), pago: utt(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)) « entrega: add(obl(informar(Y, wm, X, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)))\". Es decir, durante la actividad de pago, una obligación en el cliente X de informar al contador Y sobre el pago P del artículo Z en el tiempo T y la correspondiente declaración que cumple con esta obligación permite el flujo de una norma hacia la actividad de entrega. La norma es una obligación para el agente Y (en este caso asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) de enviar un mensaje al cliente X informando que el artículo Z ha sido entregado. Mostramos en la Figura 2 una representación diagramática de cómo se relacionan las actividades y una estructura normativa: Nivel Normativo Contrato de Entrega de Pago Salida Registro Pago Entrega Negociación Nivel de Coordinación Contrato nt Figura 2: Actividades y Estructura Normativa A medida que se emiten enunciados ilocucionarios durante las actividades, surgen posiciones normativas. Las expresiones y posiciones normativas se combinan en reglas de transición, causando el flujo de posiciones normativas entre escenas normativas. La conexión entre los dos niveles se describe en la Sección 6.2.4. DEFINICIÓN DE CONFLICTO Los términos conflicto deóntico e inconsistencia deóntica se han utilizado indistintamente en la literatura. Sin embargo, en este documento adoptamos la perspectiva de [7] en la que los autores sugieren que surge una inconsistencia deontológica cuando una acción es simultáneamente permitida y prohibida, ya que una permisión puede no ser llevada a cabo, por lo que no se produce un conflicto real. Las situaciones en las que una acción está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida son, sin embargo, conflictos deontológicos, ya que tanto las obligaciones como las prohibiciones influyen en los comportamientos de manera conflictiva. El contenido de las posiciones normativas en este documento son actos ilocutivos. Por lo tanto, surge un conflicto normativo cuando una ilocución está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida. Proponemos utilizar la noción estándar de unificación [9] para detectar cuándo se <br>superponen una prohibición y un permiso</br>. Por ejemplo, una obligación obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) y una prohibición prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T)) están en conflicto ya que se unifican bajo σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T}. Capturamos formalmente esta noción: Def. 9. Un conflicto (deóntico) surge entre dos posiciones normativas N y N bajo una sustitución σ, denotado como conflict(N, N, σ), si y solo si N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I) y unificar(¯I, ¯I, σ). Es decir, una prohibición y una obligación están en conflicto si, y solo si, sus ilocuciones se unifican bajo σ. La sustitución σ, llamada aquí el conjunto de conflictos, unifica a los agentes, roles y fórmulas atómicas. Suponemos que unificar es una implementación adecuada de un algoritmo de unificación que i) siempre termina (posiblemente fallando, si no se puede encontrar un unificador); ii) es correcto; y iii) tiene complejidad computacional lineal. Las inconsistencias causadas por la misma ilocución siendo simultáneamente permitida y prohibida pueden ser formalizadas de manera similar. En este artículo nos enfocamos en conflictos de prohibición/obligación, pero la maquinaria computacional introducida en la Sección 6.1 también puede ser utilizada para detectar inconsistencias de prohibición/permiso, si sustituimos la modalidad obl por per. 5. FORMALIZANDO LA LIBERTAD DE CONFLICTOS En esta sección introducimos algunos conocimientos previos sobre las CPN asumiendo una comprensión básica de las Redes de Petri ordinarias. Para detalles técnicos remitimos al lector a [16]. Luego mapeamos los NSs a los CPNs y analizamos sus propiedades. Las CPNs combinan la potencia de las redes de Petri con la potencia de los lenguajes de programación funcional. Por un lado, las redes de Petri proporcionan los elementos básicos para la descripción de la sincronización de procesos concurrentes. Como se observó en [16], las CPNs tienen una semántica que se basa en la concurrencia verdadera en lugar de la interlección. En nuestra opinión, una semántica de verdadera concurrencia es más fácil de trabajar porque es la forma en que imaginamos que debe ser la conexión entre el nivel de coordinación y el nivel normativo de un sistema multiagente. Por otro lado, los lenguajes de programación funcional utilizados por las CPNs proporcionan los elementos básicos para la definición de tipos de datos y la manipulación de sus valores de datos. Por lo tanto, podemos traducir fácilmente expresiones de una estructura normativa. Por último, pero no menos importante, las CPN tienen una semántica bien definida que define de manera inequívoca el comportamiento de cada CPN. Además, las CPNs cuentan con una gran cantidad de métodos y herramientas de análisis formales mediante los cuales se pueden demostrar propiedades de las CPNs. En resumen, las CPNs nos proporcionan todas las características necesarias para razonar formalmente sobre estructuras normativas siempre que se proporcione un mapeo adecuado. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri, los estados de una CPN se representan mediante lugares. Pero a diferencia de las Redes de Petri, cada lugar tiene un tipo de dato asociado que determina el tipo de datos que el lugar puede contener. Un estado de una CPN se llama marcado. Consiste en una serie de fichas colocadas en los lugares individuales. Cada token lleva consigo un valor de datos que tiene el tipo del lugar correspondiente. En general, un lugar puede contener dos o más fichas con el mismo valor de datos. Por lo tanto, una marca de una CPN es una función que asigna a cada plaza un multiconjunto de fichas del tipo correcto. Uno a menudo se refiere a los valores de los tokens como colores de tokens y también se refiere a los tipos de datos como conjuntos de colores. Los tipos de una CPN pueden ser arbitrariamente complejos. Las acciones en una CPN se representan mediante transiciones. Un arco entrante en una transición desde un lugar indica que la transición puede eliminar fichas del lugar correspondiente, mientras que un arco saliente indica que la transición puede agregar fichas. El número exacto de tokens y sus valores de datos son determinados por las expresiones de arco, las cuales están codificadas utilizando el lenguaje de programación elegido para la CPN. Una transición está habilitada en una CPN si y solo si el multi-conjunto (o bolsa) 2 A es una extensión de la noción de conjunto, permitiendo la posibilidad de múltiples apariciones del mismo elemento. El Sexto Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), 639 variables en las expresiones de sus arcos entrantes están vinculadas a algún valor (cada uno de estos vínculos se denomina elemento de vinculación). Si es así, la transición puede ocurrir al eliminar fichas de sus lugares de entrada y agregar fichas a sus lugares de salida. Además de las expresiones de arco, es posible adjuntar una expresión de guardia booleana (con variables) a cada transición. Al juntar todos los elementos anteriores, obtenemos una definición formal de CPN que se empleará más adelante con fines de mapeo. Definición 10. Un CPN es una tupla Σ, P, T, A, N, C, G, E, I donde: (i) Σ es un conjunto finito de tipos no vacíos, también llamados conjuntos de colores; (ii) P es un conjunto finito de lugares; (iii) T es un conjunto finito de transiciones; (iv) A es un conjunto finito de arcos; (v) N es una función de nodo definida de A en P × T ∪ T × P; (vi) C es una función de color de P en Σ; (vii) G es una función de guarda de T en expresiones; (viii) E es una función de expresión de arco de A en expresiones; (ix) I es una función de inicialización de P en expresiones cerradas; Nótese que la explicación informal de las reglas de habilitación y ocurrencia proporcionadas anteriormente sienta las bases para comprender el comportamiento de un CPN. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri ordinarias, el comportamiento concurrente de una CPN se basa en la noción de paso. Formalmente, un paso es un multi-conjunto no vacío y finito sobre el conjunto de todos los elementos de enlace. Sea el paso S habilitado en una marcación M. Entonces, S puede ocurrir, cambiando la marcación M a M'. Además, decimos que la marca M es directamente alcanzable desde la marca M mediante la ocurrencia del paso S, y lo denotamos como M[S > M. Una secuencia de ocurrencias finitas es una secuencia finita de pasos y marcas: M1[S1 > M2... Mn[Sn > Mn+1 tal que n ∈ N y Mi[Si > Mi+1 ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. \n\n(Note: The original sentence seems to have a typo or missing information, as it is not complete or clear in its meaning.) El conjunto de todas las marcas posibles alcanzables para una red Net desde una marca M se llama su conjunto de alcanzabilidad, y se denota como R(Net, M). 5.1 Mapeo a Redes de Petri Coloreadas. Nuestra estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado. Lo mismo es cierto para una Red de Petri de Colores. Estamos presentando un mapeo f de uno a otro, con el fin de proporcionar semántica para la estructura normativa y demostrar propiedades sobre ella utilizando resultados teóricos bien conocidos del trabajo en CPNs. El mapeo f hace uso de correspondencias entre escenas normativas y lugares de CPN, transiciones normativas y transiciones de CPN y finalmente, entre etiquetas de arco y expresiones de arco de CPN. S → P B → T Lin ∪ Lout → E El conjunto de tipos es el conjunto unitario que contiene el color NP (es decir, Σ = {NP}). Este tipo complejo está estructurado de la siguiente manera (usamos la sintaxis CPN-ML [4]): color NPT = con Obl | Per | Prh | NoMod color IP = con informar | declarar | ofrecer color UTT = registro illp: IP ag1, rol1, ag2, rol2: cadena contenido: cadena tiempo: entero color NP = registro modo: NPT ilocución: UTT Modelar las ilocuciones como normas sin modalidad (NoMod) es un truco formal que utilizamos para asegurar que las subredes puedan combinarse como se explica a continuación. Los arcos son mapeados casi directamente. A es un conjunto finito de arcos y N es una función de nodo, tal que ∀a ∈ A ∃a ∈ Ain ∪Aout. N(a) = a. La función de inicialización I se define como I(p) = Δs (∀s ∈ S donde p se obtiene de s usando el mapeo; recuerda que s = ids, Δs). Finalmente, la función de color C asigna el color NP a cada lugar: C(p) = NP (∀p ∈ P). No estamos haciendo uso de la función de guardia G. En trabajos futuros, esta función puede ser utilizada para modelar restricciones cuando ampliemos la expresividad de nuestro lenguaje normativo. 5.2 Propiedades de Estructuras Normativas Habiendo definido la asignación de estructuras normativas a Redes de Petri de Colores, ahora examinamos propiedades de las RPC que nos ayudan a comprender la complejidad de la detección de conflictos. Una pregunta que nos gustaría responder es si, en un momento dado, una estructura normativa dada está libre de conflictos. Una instantánea de una estructura normativa corresponde a una marca en la CPN mapeada. Definición 11. Dada una marcación Mi, esta marcación es libre de conflictos si ¬∃p ∈ P. ∃np1, np2 ∈ Mi(p) tal que np1.modo = Obl y np2.modo = Prh y np1.illoc y np2.illoc unifican bajo una sustitución válida. Otra pregunta interesante sería si surgirá un conflicto a partir de tal instantánea del sistema al propagar las posiciones normativas. Para responder a esta pregunta, primero traducimos la instantánea de la estructura normativa al CPN correspondiente y luego ejecutamos la secuencia finita de ocurrencias de marcas y pasos, verificando la ausencia de conflictos en cada marca a medida que avanzamos. Definición 12. Dada una marca Mi, una secuencia finita de ocurrencias Si, Si+1, ..., Sn se llama libre de conflictos, si y solo si Mi[Si > Mi+1 . . . Mn[Sn > Mn+1 y Mk es libre de conflictos para todo k tal que i ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Sin embargo, la pregunta principal que nos gustaría investigar es si una estructura normativa dada es resistente al conflicto, es decir, si los agentes que implementan el MAS son capaces de generar conflictos a través de sus acciones. Tan pronto como se incluye la posibilidad de acciones (o enunciados) de agentes autónomos, se pierde el determinismo. Habiendo mapeado la estructura normativa a un CPN, ahora agregamos modelos de CPN de las interacciones de los agentes. Cada forma de interacción de agentes (es decir, cada actividad) puede ser modelada utilizando CPNs siguiendo la línea de Cost et al. [5]. Estas CPN no determinísticas alimentan tokens en la CPN que modela la estructura normativa. Esto conlleva a la introducción de no determinismo en la CPN combinada. La mitad inferior de la figura 3 muestra parte de un modelo CPN de un protocolo de agente donde el arco denotado con 1 representa alguna enunciación de una ilocución por un agente. La transición objetivo de este arco, no solo mueve un token al siguiente estado de esta CPN, sino que también coloca un token en el lugar correspondiente a la escena normativa apropiada en el modelo CPN de la estructura normativa (a través del arco 2). La transición 3 finalmente pudo propagar ese token en forma de obligación, por ejemplo. Por lo tanto, a partir de una marca dada, son posibles muchas secuencias de ocurrencia diferentes dependiendo de las acciones de los agentes. Hacemos uso del conjunto de alcanzabilidad R para definir una situación en la que los agentes no pueden causar conflictos. 640 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) Figura 3: Construyendo la CPN combinada Def. 13. Dado una red N, una marcación M es resistente a conflictos si y solo si todas las marcaciones en R(N,M) son libres de conflictos. Verificar la libertad de conflicto de una marca se puede hacer en tiempo polinómico al revisar todos los lugares de la CPN en busca de fichas en conflicto. La libertad de conflicto de una secuencia de ocurrencias en la CPN que representa la estructura normativa también se puede lograr en tiempo polinómico, ya que esta secuencia es determinista dado un instante. Ya sea que una estructura normativa esté diseñada de manera segura corresponde a verificar la resistencia al conflicto de la marca inicial M0. Ahora, verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una marca se convierte en una tarea muy difícil. Corresponde al problema de alcanzabilidad en una CPN: ¿se puede alcanzar un estado o lograr una marcación que contenga un conflicto? Este problema de alcanzabilidad se sabe que es NP-completo para las Redes de Petri ordinarias [22] y dado que las CPNs son funcionalmente idénticas, no podemos esperar verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una estructura normativa fuera de línea en una cantidad razonable de tiempo. Por lo tanto, se necesitan mecanismos distribuidos en tiempo de ejecución para garantizar que una estructura normativa mantenga la consistencia. Presentamos un mecanismo de este tipo en la siguiente sección. 6. Una vez que se ha detectado un conflicto (según se define en la Sección 4), proponemos emplear el unificador para resolver el conflicto. En nuestro ejemplo, si las variables en prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) no obtienen los valores especificados en la sustitución σ, entonces no habrá un conflicto. Sin embargo, en lugar de calcular el conjunto complementario de una sustitución (que puede ser un conjunto infinito), proponemos anotar la prohibición con el unificador mismo y usarlo para determinar qué variables no pueden ser en futuras unificaciones para evitar un conflicto. Por lo tanto, designamos las prohibiciones anotadas como prh(¯I) Σ, donde Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, es un conjunto de unificadores. Las normas anotadas se interpretan como construcciones deónticas con influencias limitadas, es decir, su efecto (sobre agentes, roles e ilocuciones) ha sido restringido por el conjunto Σ de unificadores. Una prohibición puede estar en conflicto con varias obligaciones en una escena normativa dada s = id, Δ y necesitamos registrar (y posiblemente evitar) todos estos conflictos. A continuación definimos un algoritmo que garantiza que una posición normativa se agregará a una escena normativa de tal manera que no cause conflictos. Aunque proponemos reducir las prohibiciones, la misma maquinaria puede utilizarse para definir la reducción de obligaciones en su lugar. Estas políticas diferentes dependen de la semántica deontológica prevista y de los requisitos de los sistemas abordados. Por ejemplo, algunas MASs pueden requerir que sus agentes no actúen en presencia de conflictos, es decir, que la obligación debe ser limitada. 6.1 Resolución de Conflictos Proponemos una forma detallada de resolver conflictos normativos a través de la unificación. Detectamos la superposición de las influencias de las normas, es decir, cómo afectan el comportamiento de los agentes involucrados, y reducimos la influencia de la posición normativa, utilizando adecuadamente las anotaciones al verificar si la norma se aplica a las ilocuciones. El algoritmo mostrado en la Figura 4 representa cómo mantenemos un conjunto de normas libre de conflictos. Agrega una norma dada N a un estado normativo Δ existente y libre de conflictos, obteniendo un nuevo estado normativo resultante Δ que es libre de conflictos, es decir, sus prohibiciones están anotadas con un conjunto de conjuntos de conflictos que indican qué asignaciones para variables deben evitarse para que no ocurran conflictos. algoritmo addNorm(N, Δ) comienza 1 marca de tiempo(N) 2 caso N de 3 per(¯I): Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 4 prh(I): si N ∈ Δ tal que conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Δ := Δ 5 de lo contrario Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 6 prh(¯I): 7 comienza 8 Σ := ∅ 9 para cada N ∈ Δ hacer 10 si conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Σ := Σ ∪ {σ} 11 Δ := Δ ∪ {N Σ} 12 fin 13 obl(¯I): 14 comienza 15 Δ1 := ∅; Δ2 := ∅ 16 para cada (N Σ) ∈ Δ hacer 17 si N = prh(I) entonces 18 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 19 de lo contrario nulo 20 de lo contrario 21 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces 22 comienza 23 Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 24 Δ2 := Δ2 ∪ {N (Σ ∪ {σ})} 25 fin 26 Δ := (Δ − Δ1) ∪ Δ2 ∪ {N} 27 fin 28 fin caso 29 devolver Δ fin Figura 4: Algoritmo para Preservar la Libertad de Conflictos El algoritmo utiliza una estructura de caso para diferenciar las diferentes posibilidades para una norma dada N. La línea 3 aborda el caso en el que la norma dada es un permiso: N simplemente se agrega a Δ. Las líneas 4-5 abordan el caso en el que intentamos agregar una prohibición de base a un estado normativo: si entra en conflicto con alguna obligación, entonces se descarta; de lo contrario, se agrega al estado normativo. Las líneas 6-12 describen la situación cuando la posición normativa a añadir es una prohibición no fundamentada. En este caso, el algoritmo inicializa Σ como un conjunto vacío y recorre en bucle (línea 9-10) las normas N en el estado normativo anterior Δ. Al encontrar uno que entre en conflicto con N, el algoritmo actualiza Σ agregando el conjunto de conflictos recién encontrado σ a él (línea 10). Al recorrer Δ en un bucle, podemos verificar cualquier conflicto entre la nueva prohibición y las obligaciones existentes, construyendo adecuadamente la anotación Σ que se utilizará al agregar N a Δ en la línea 11. Las líneas 13-27 describen cómo una nueva obligación se adapta a un estado normativo existente. Hacemos uso de dos conjuntos temporales inicialmente vacíos, Δ1, Δ2. El algoritmo recorre Δ (líneas 16-25) recogiendo aquellas prohibiciones anotadas N Σ que entran en conflicto con la nueva obligación. Sin embargo, hay dos casos con los que tratar: uno cuando un terreno La Sexta Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se encuentra la prohibición 641 (línea 17) y su excepción, que abarca prohibiciones no fundamentadas (línea 20). En ambos casos, la antigua prohibición se almacena en Δ1 (líneas 18 y 23) para ser posteriormente eliminada de Δ (línea 26). Sin embargo, en el caso de una prohibición no basada en tierra, el algoritmo actualiza su anotación de conjuntos de conflictos (línea 24). El bucle garantiza que se realice una búsqueda exhaustiva (lineal) a través de un estado normativo, verificando si la nueva obligación entra en conflicto con alguna prohibición existente, posiblemente actualizando las anotaciones de estas prohibiciones conflictivas. En la línea 26, el algoritmo construye el nuevo Δ actualizado eliminando las antiguas prohibiciones almacenadas en Δ1 y agregando las prohibiciones actualizadas almacenadas en Δ2 (si las hay), así como la nueva obligación N. Nuestro algoritmo propuesto es correcto en el sentido de que, para una posición normativa N dada y un estado normativo Δ, proporciona un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que todas las prohibiciones tienen anotaciones que registran cómo se unifican con las obligaciones existentes. Las anotaciones pueden estar vacías, sin embargo, este es el caso cuando tenemos una prohibición de base o una prohibición que no unifica/conflicta con ninguna obligación. Los permisos no afectan nuestro algoritmo y se manejan adecuadamente (línea 3). Cualquier intento de insertar una prohibición de base que entre en conflicto, produce el mismo estado normativo (línea 4). Cuando se agrega una nueva obligación, el algoritmo garantiza que se consideren todas las prohibiciones (líneas 14-27), lo que lleva a la eliminación de prohibiciones fundamentales conflictivas o la actualización de anotaciones de prohibiciones no fundamentales. El algoritmo siempre termina: los bucles están sobre un conjunto finito Δ y las verificaciones de conflictos y operaciones de conjunto siempre terminan. La complejidad del algoritmo es lineal: el conjunto Δ solo se examina una vez para cada posible caso de norma que se agregue. Al gestionar estados normativos, también puede ser necesario eliminar posiciones normativas. Esto es sencillo: los permisos se pueden eliminar sin problemas; las prohibiciones anotadas también se pueden eliminar sin más consideraciones; sin embargo, las obligaciones requieren cierto mantenimiento. Cuando una obligación debe ser eliminada, debemos verificarla con todas las prohibiciones anotadas para actualizar sus anotaciones. Aplicamos la verificación de conflictos y obtenemos un unificador, luego eliminamos este unificador de la anotación de prohibiciones. Invocamos el algoritmo de eliminación como removeNorm(N, Δ): devuelve un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que se ha eliminado N, con posibles alteraciones en otras posiciones normativas como se explica. 6.2 Promulgación de una Estructura Normativa La promulgación de una estructura normativa implica la ejecución paralela y distribuida de escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Con fines ilustrativos, a continuación describiremos la interacción entre las escenas normativas de pago y entrega y la transición normativa nt que las vincula en la mitad superior de la figura 2. Con este objetivo, considere por ejemplo que obl(inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpago y que Δentrega sostiene prh(inform(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)). Tales estados indican que el cliente Jules está obligado a pagar £400 por 350 kg de cobre al contador Rod de acuerdo con la escena normativa de pago, mientras que Rod, asumiendo el papel de gerente de almacén en esta ocasión, tiene prohibido entregar cualquier cosa al cliente Jules de acuerdo con la escena normativa de entrega. Para cada escena normativa, el proceso de promulgación es el siguiente. En primer lugar, procesa su cola de mensajes entrantes que contiene tres tipos de mensajes: enunciados de la actividad a la que está vinculado; y comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar posiciones normativas. Por ejemplo, en nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago recopila la ilocución I = utt((inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), 35)) que representa al cliente Jules pendiente de pago por cobre (a través de la flecha A en la figura 2). Las expresiones son marcadas con la hora y luego se agregan al estado normativo. Tendríamos Δpago = Δpago ∪ {I}, en nuestro ejemplo. Al recibir comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar una posición normativa, la escena normativa invoca el algoritmo de adición o eliminación correspondiente descrito en la Sección 6.1. En segundo lugar, la escena normativa reconoce su cambio de estado al enviar un mensaje de activación a cada transición normativa saliente a la que está conectada. En nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago estaría señalando su cambio de estado a la transición normativa nt. Para las transiciones normativas, el proceso funciona de manera diferente. Debido a que cada transición normativa controla la operación de una regla única, al recibir un mensaje de activación, sondea cada escena normativa entrante en busca de sustituciones para los esquemas ilocucionales relevantes en el LHS de su regla. En nuestro ejemplo, nt (siendo responsable de la regla descrita en la Sección 3.4), sondearía la escena normativa de pagos (a través de la flecha B) en busca de sustituciones. Al recibir respuestas de ellos (en forma de conjuntos de sustituciones junto con marcas de tiempo), se deben unificar las sustituciones de cada una de estas escenas normativas. Para cada unificación que encuentra, la regla se activa, y por lo tanto se envía el comando normativo correspondiente a la escena normativa de salida. La transición normativa luego lleva un registro del mensaje de activación que envió y de los sellos de tiempo de las posiciones normativas que desencadenaron la activación. Esto se hace para asegurar que las mismas posiciones normativas en el LHS de una regla solo activen su disparo una vez. En nuestro ejemplo, nt estaría recibiendo σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} de la escena normativa de pago. Dado que las sustituciones en σ unifican con la regla nts, la regla se activa y se envía el comando normativo adicionar(entrega : obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350), T)) a la escena normativa de entrega para obligar a Rod a entregar al cliente Jules 350 kg de cobre. Después de eso, la escena normativa de entrega invocaría el algoritmo addNorm de la figura 4 con Δentrega y N = obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350)) como argumentos. 7. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Y CONCLUSIONES Nuestras contribuciones en este artículo son triples. En primer lugar, presentamos un enfoque para la gestión y razonamiento sobre normas de manera distribuida. Hasta donde sabemos, hay poco trabajo publicado en esta dirección. En [8, 21], se presentan dos idiomas para la aplicación distribuida de normas en MAS. Sin embargo, en ambos trabajos, cada agente tiene una interfaz de mensajes local que reenvía mensajes legales de acuerdo con un conjunto de normas. Dado que estas interfaces son locales para cada agente, las normas solo pueden expresarse en términos de acciones de ese agente. Esta es una seria desventaja, por ejemplo, cuando se necesita activar una obligación hacia un agente debido a un mensaje de otro. La segunda contribución es la propuesta de una estructura normativa. La noción es fructífera porque permite la separación de preocupaciones normativas y procedimentales. La estructura normativa que proponemos pone de manifiesto la similitud entre la propagación de posiciones normativas y la propagación 642 de la Sexta Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) de tokens en Redes de Petri de Colores. Esa similitud sugiere fácilmente un mapeo entre ambos, y proporciona fundamentos para un tratamiento analítico conveniente de la estructura normativa, en general, y la complejidad de la detección de conflictos, en particular. La idea de modelar interacciones (en forma de conversaciones) a través de Redes de Petri ha sido investigada en [18], donde el medio de interacción y los agentes individuales son modelados como subredes de CPN que posteriormente se combinan para su análisis. En [5], las conversaciones se diseñan y analizan primero a nivel de CPNs y luego se traducen a protocolos. Lin et al. [20] mapean los esquemas de conversación a CPNs. Hasta donde sabemos, el uso de esta representación en el apoyo a la detección de conflictos en MAS regulados no ha sido reportado en otro lugar. Finalmente, presentamos un mecanismo distribuido para resolver conflictos normativos. Sartor [25] aborda los conflictos normativos desde el punto de vista de la teoría legal y sugiere una forma de ordenar las normas involucradas. Su idea se implementa en [12] pero requiere un recurso central para el mantenimiento de la norma. El enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos es una adaptación y extensión del trabajo sobre grafos de instanciación reportado en [17] y un algoritmo relacionado en [27]. El algoritmo presentado en el artículo actual se puede utilizar para gestionar estados normativos de forma distribuida: escenas normativas que ocurren en paralelo tienen un estado normativo asociado Δ al cual el algoritmo se aplica de forma independiente cada vez que se introduce una nueva norma. Estas tres contribuciones que presentamos en este artículo abren muchas posibilidades para trabajos futuros. Deberíamos mencionar primero que, como estrategia general, estamos trabajando en una generalización de la noción de estructura normativa para hacerla operar con diferentes modelos de coordinación, con un contenido deóntico más rico y sobre diferentes realizaciones computacionales de MAS regulados. Como primer paso en esta dirección, estamos aprovechando el desacoplamiento entre los protocolos de interacción y la orientación normativa declarativa que la estructura normativa pone a disposición, para proporcionar una capa normativa para las instituciones electrónicas (como se define en [1]). Esperamos que dicho acoplamiento dote a las instituciones electrónicas de un entorno normativo más flexible y expresivo. Además, queremos ampliar nuestro modelo en varias direcciones: (1) para manejar la negación y restricciones como parte del lenguaje normativo, y en particular la noción de tiempo; (2) para acomodar múltiples autoridades normativas jerárquicas basadas en roles, siguiendo las líneas de Cholvy y Cuppens [3] y las relaciones de poder sugeridas por Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) para capturar en el algoritmo de resolución de conflictos diferentes semánticas relacionadas con las nociones deónticas mediante el apoyo a diferentes axiomatizaciones (por ejemplo, la fuerza relativa de la prohibición versus la obligación, nociones deónticas por defecto, inconsistencias deónticas). En el lado teórico, pretendemos utilizar técnicas de análisis de CPNs para caracterizar clases de CPNs (por ejemplo, acíclicos, simétricos, etc.) correspondientes a familias de Estructuras Normativas que son susceptibles a la detección de conflictos offline manejables. La combinación de estas técnicas junto con nuestros mecanismos en línea de resolución de conflictos tiene como objetivo dotar a los diseñadores de MAS con la capacidad de incorporar normas en sus sistemas de manera fundamentada.

                "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
                "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",

                "In this section, we first present a simple language capturing these aspects and formally introduce the notions of normative scene, normative transition rule and normative structure.",
                "We give the intended semantics of these rules and show how to control a MAS via norms in an example. 3.1 Basic Concepts The building blocks of our language are terms and atomic formulae: Def. 1.",

                "We will be making use of identifiers throughout the paper, which are constant terms and also need the following definition: Def. 2.",
                "An atomic formula is any construct p(t1, . . . , tn), where p is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1, . . . , tn are terms.",
                "The set of all atomic formulae is denoted as Δ.",
                "We focus on an expressive class of MASs in which interaction is carried out by means of illocutionary speech acts exchanged among participating agents: Def. 3.",
                "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
                "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",
                "In the description of a protocol, for instance, the precise values of the message exchanged can be left unspecified.",
                "During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution.",
                "We can thus define illocution schemata: Def. 4.",
                "An illocution schema ¯I is any atomic formula p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) in which some of the terms may either be variables or may contain variables. 3.2 Formal Definition of the Notion of NS We first define normative scenes as follows: Def. 5.",
                "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request.",

                "The loop guarantees that an exhaustive (linear) search through a normative state takes place, checking if the new obligation is in conflict with any existing prohibitions, possibly updating the annotations of these conflicting prohibitions.",
                "In line 26 the algorithm builds the new updated Δ by removing the old prohibitions stored in Δ1 and adding the updated prohibitions stored in Δ2 (if any), as well as the new obligation N. Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations.",
                "The annotations can be empty, though: this is the case when we have a ground prohibition or a prohibition which does not unify/conflict with any obligation.",
                "Permissions do not affect our algorithm and they are appropriately dealt with (line 3).",
                "Any attempt to insert a ground prohibition which conflicts, yields the same normative state (line 4).",
                "When a new obligation is being added then the algorithm guarantees that all prohibitions are considered (lines 14-27), leading to the removal of conflicting ground prohibitions or the update of annotations of non-ground prohibitions.",
                "The algorithm always terminates: the loops are over a finite set Δ and the conflict checks and set operations always terminate.",
                "The complexity of the algorithm is linear: the set Δ is only examined once for each possible case of norm to be added.",
                "When managing normative states we may also need to remove normative positions.",
                "This is straightforward: permissions can be removed without any problems; annotated prohibitions can also be removed without further considerations; obligations, however, require some housekeeping.",
                "When an obligation is to be removed, we must check it against all annotated prohibitions in order to update their annotations.",
                "We apply the conflict check and obtain a unifier, then remove this unifier from the prohibitions annotation.",
                "We invoke the removal algorithm as removeNorm(N, Δ): it returns a new normative state Δ in which N has been removed, with possible alterations to other normative positions as explained. 6.2 Enactment of a Normative Structure The enactment of a normative structure amounts to the parallel, distributed execution of normative scenes and normative transitions.",
                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",

                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",

                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud. Ten en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa Δs evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás. Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo. Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6. Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una posición normativa (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Definición 7. Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una regla de transición normativa. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un grafo bipartito al que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas. Definición 8. Una estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout. Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1. Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativas describiendo cómo una regla cambia una escena normativa de una estructura normativa existente, dando como resultado una nueva estructura normativa. Cada regla se activa una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes. Una fórmula atómica (es decir, una enunciación o una posición normativa) se cumple si es unificable con una enunciación o posición normativa que pertenece al estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Cada vez que se activa una regla, se lleva a cabo el comando normativo especificado en el lado derecho de esa regla, con la intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa del estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Sin embargo, la adición no es incondicional ya que pueden surgir conflictos. Este tema será tratado en las Secciones 4 y 6.1. 638 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. En nuestro ejemplo en curso tenemos la siguiente regla de transición normativa ejemplar: \"pago: obl(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)), pago: utt(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)) « entrega: add(obl(informar(Y, wm, X, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)))\". Es decir, durante la actividad de pago, una obligación en el cliente X de informar al contador Y sobre el pago P del artículo Z en el tiempo T y la correspondiente declaración que cumple con esta obligación permite el flujo de una norma hacia la actividad de entrega. La norma es una obligación para el agente Y (en este caso asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) de enviar un mensaje al cliente X informando que el artículo Z ha sido entregado. Mostramos en la Figura 2 una representación diagramática de cómo se relacionan las actividades y una estructura normativa: Nivel Normativo Contrato de Entrega de Pago Salida Registro Pago Entrega Negociación Nivel de Coordinación Contrato nt Figura 2: Actividades y Estructura Normativa A medida que se emiten enunciados ilocucionarios durante las actividades, surgen posiciones normativas. Las expresiones y posiciones normativas se combinan en reglas de transición, causando el flujo de posiciones normativas entre escenas normativas. La conexión entre los dos niveles se describe en la Sección 6.2.4. DEFINICIÓN DE CONFLICTO Los términos conflicto deóntico e inconsistencia deóntica se han utilizado indistintamente en la literatura. Sin embargo, en este documento adoptamos la perspectiva de [7] en la que los autores sugieren que surge una inconsistencia deontológica cuando una acción es simultáneamente permitida y prohibida, ya que una permisión puede no ser llevada a cabo, por lo que no se produce un conflicto real. Las situaciones en las que una acción está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida son, sin embargo, conflictos deontológicos, ya que tanto las obligaciones como las prohibiciones influyen en los comportamientos de manera conflictiva. El contenido de las posiciones normativas en este documento son actos ilocutivos. Por lo tanto, surge un conflicto normativo cuando una ilocución está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida. Proponemos utilizar la noción estándar de unificación [9] para detectar cuándo se superponen una prohibición y un permiso. Por ejemplo, una obligación obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) y una prohibición prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T)) están en conflicto ya que se unifican bajo σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T}. Capturamos formalmente esta noción: Def. 9. Un conflicto (deóntico) surge entre dos posiciones normativas N y N bajo una sustitución σ, denotado como conflict(N, N, σ), si y solo si N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I) y unificar(¯I, ¯I, σ). Es decir, una prohibición y una obligación están en conflicto si, y solo si, sus ilocuciones se unifican bajo σ. La sustitución σ, llamada aquí el conjunto de conflictos, unifica a los agentes, roles y fórmulas atómicas. Suponemos que unificar es una implementación adecuada de un algoritmo de unificación que i) siempre termina (posiblemente fallando, si no se puede encontrar un unificador); ii) es correcto; y iii) tiene complejidad computacional lineal. Las inconsistencias causadas por la misma ilocución siendo simultáneamente permitida y prohibida pueden ser formalizadas de manera similar. En este artículo nos enfocamos en conflictos de prohibición/obligación, pero la maquinaria computacional introducida en la Sección 6.1 también puede ser utilizada para detectar inconsistencias de prohibición/permiso, si sustituimos la modalidad obl por per. 5. FORMALIZANDO LA LIBERTAD DE CONFLICTOS En esta sección introducimos algunos conocimientos previos sobre las CPN asumiendo una comprensión básica de las Redes de Petri ordinarias. Para detalles técnicos remitimos al lector a [16]. Luego mapeamos los NSs a los CPNs y analizamos sus propiedades. Las CPNs combinan la potencia de las redes de Petri con la potencia de los lenguajes de programación funcional. Por un lado, las redes de Petri proporcionan los elementos básicos para la descripción de la sincronización de procesos concurrentes. Como se observó en [16], las CPNs tienen una semántica que se basa en la concurrencia verdadera en lugar de la interlección. En nuestra opinión, una semántica de verdadera concurrencia es más fácil de trabajar porque es la forma en que imaginamos que debe ser la conexión entre el nivel de coordinación y el nivel normativo de un sistema multiagente. Por otro lado, los lenguajes de programación funcional utilizados por las CPNs proporcionan los elementos básicos para la definición de tipos de datos y la manipulación de sus valores de datos. Por lo tanto, podemos traducir fácilmente expresiones de una estructura normativa. Por último, pero no menos importante, las CPN tienen una semántica bien definida que define de manera inequívoca el comportamiento de cada CPN. Además, las CPNs cuentan con una gran cantidad de métodos y herramientas de análisis formales mediante los cuales se pueden demostrar propiedades de las CPNs. En resumen, las CPNs nos proporcionan todas las características necesarias para razonar formalmente sobre estructuras normativas siempre que se proporcione un mapeo adecuado. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri, los estados de una CPN se representan mediante lugares. Pero a diferencia de las Redes de Petri, cada lugar tiene un tipo de dato asociado que determina el tipo de datos que el lugar puede contener. Un estado de una CPN se llama marcado. Consiste en una serie de fichas colocadas en los lugares individuales. Cada <br>token</br> lleva consigo un valor de datos que tiene el tipo del lugar correspondiente. En general, un lugar puede contener dos o más fichas con el mismo valor de datos. Por lo tanto, una marca de una CPN es una función que asigna a cada plaza un multiconjunto de fichas del tipo correcto. Uno a menudo se refiere a los valores de los <br>tokens</br> como colores de <br>tokens</br> y también se refiere a los tipos de datos como conjuntos de colores. Los tipos de una CPN pueden ser arbitrariamente complejos. Las acciones en una CPN se representan mediante transiciones. Un arco entrante en una transición desde un lugar indica que la transición puede eliminar fichas del lugar correspondiente, mientras que un arco saliente indica que la transición puede agregar fichas. El número exacto de tokens y sus valores de datos son determinados por las expresiones de arco, las cuales están codificadas utilizando el lenguaje de programación elegido para la CPN. Una transición está habilitada en una CPN si y solo si el multi-conjunto (o bolsa) 2 A es una extensión de la noción de conjunto, permitiendo la posibilidad de múltiples apariciones del mismo elemento. El Sexto Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), 639 variables en las expresiones de sus arcos entrantes están vinculadas a algún valor (cada uno de estos vínculos se denomina elemento de vinculación). Si es así, la transición puede ocurrir al eliminar fichas de sus lugares de entrada y agregar fichas a sus lugares de salida. Además de las expresiones de arco, es posible adjuntar una expresión de guardia booleana (con variables) a cada transición. Al juntar todos los elementos anteriores, obtenemos una definición formal de CPN que se empleará más adelante con fines de mapeo. Definición 10. Un CPN es una tupla Σ, P, T, A, N, C, G, E, I donde: (i) Σ es un conjunto finito de tipos no vacíos, también llamados conjuntos de colores; (ii) P es un conjunto finito de lugares; (iii) T es un conjunto finito de transiciones; (iv) A es un conjunto finito de arcos; (v) N es una función de nodo definida de A en P × T ∪ T × P; (vi) C es una función de color de P en Σ; (vii) G es una función de guarda de T en expresiones; (viii) E es una función de expresión de arco de A en expresiones; (ix) I es una función de inicialización de P en expresiones cerradas; Nótese que la explicación informal de las reglas de habilitación y ocurrencia proporcionadas anteriormente sienta las bases para comprender el comportamiento de un CPN. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri ordinarias, el comportamiento concurrente de una CPN se basa en la noción de paso. Formalmente, un paso es un multi-conjunto no vacío y finito sobre el conjunto de todos los elementos de enlace. Sea el paso S habilitado en una marcación M. Entonces, S puede ocurrir, cambiando la marcación M a M'. Además, decimos que la marca M es directamente alcanzable desde la marca M mediante la ocurrencia del paso S, y lo denotamos como M[S > M. Una secuencia de ocurrencias finitas es una secuencia finita de pasos y marcas: M1[S1 > M2... Mn[Sn > Mn+1 tal que n ∈ N y Mi[Si > Mi+1 ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. \n\n(Note: The original sentence seems to have a typo or missing information, as it is not complete or clear in its meaning.) El conjunto de todas las marcas posibles alcanzables para una red Net desde una marca M se llama su conjunto de alcanzabilidad, y se denota como R(Net, M). 5.1 Mapeo a Redes de Petri Coloreadas. Nuestra estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado. Lo mismo es cierto para una Red de Petri de Colores. Estamos presentando un mapeo f de uno a otro, con el fin de proporcionar semántica para la estructura normativa y demostrar propiedades sobre ella utilizando resultados teóricos bien conocidos del trabajo en CPNs. El mapeo f hace uso de correspondencias entre escenas normativas y lugares de CPN, transiciones normativas y transiciones de CPN y finalmente, entre etiquetas de arco y expresiones de arco de CPN. S → P B → T Lin ∪ Lout → E El conjunto de tipos es el conjunto unitario que contiene el color NP (es decir, Σ = {NP}). Este tipo complejo está estructurado de la siguiente manera (usamos la sintaxis CPN-ML [4]): color NPT = con Obl | Per | Prh | NoMod color IP = con informar | declarar | ofrecer color UTT = registro illp: IP ag1, rol1, ag2, rol2: cadena contenido: cadena tiempo: entero color NP = registro modo: NPT ilocución: UTT Modelar las ilocuciones como normas sin modalidad (NoMod) es un truco formal que utilizamos para asegurar que las subredes puedan combinarse como se explica a continuación. Los arcos son mapeados casi directamente. A es un conjunto finito de arcos y N es una función de nodo, tal que ∀a ∈ A ∃a ∈ Ain ∪Aout. N(a) = a. La función de inicialización I se define como I(p) = Δs (∀s ∈ S donde p se obtiene de s usando el mapeo; recuerda que s = ids, Δs). Finalmente, la función de color C asigna el color NP a cada lugar: C(p) = NP (∀p ∈ P). No estamos haciendo uso de la función de guardia G. En trabajos futuros, esta función puede ser utilizada para modelar restricciones cuando ampliemos la expresividad de nuestro lenguaje normativo. 5.2 Propiedades de Estructuras Normativas Habiendo definido la asignación de estructuras normativas a Redes de Petri de Colores, ahora examinamos propiedades de las RPC que nos ayudan a comprender la complejidad de la detección de conflictos. Una pregunta que nos gustaría responder es si, en un momento dado, una estructura normativa dada está libre de conflictos. Una instantánea de una estructura normativa corresponde a una marca en la CPN mapeada. Definición 11. Dada una marcación Mi, esta marcación es libre de conflictos si ¬∃p ∈ P. ∃np1, np2 ∈ Mi(p) tal que np1.modo = Obl y np2.modo = Prh y np1.illoc y np2.illoc unifican bajo una sustitución válida. Otra pregunta interesante sería si surgirá un conflicto a partir de tal instantánea del sistema al propagar las posiciones normativas. Para responder a esta pregunta, primero traducimos la instantánea de la estructura normativa al CPN correspondiente y luego ejecutamos la secuencia finita de ocurrencias de marcas y pasos, verificando la ausencia de conflictos en cada marca a medida que avanzamos. Definición 12. Dada una marca Mi, una secuencia finita de ocurrencias Si, Si+1, ..., Sn se llama libre de conflictos, si y solo si Mi[Si > Mi+1 . . . Mn[Sn > Mn+1 y Mk es libre de conflictos para todo k tal que i ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Sin embargo, la pregunta principal que nos gustaría investigar es si una estructura normativa dada es resistente al conflicto, es decir, si los agentes que implementan el MAS son capaces de generar conflictos a través de sus acciones. Tan pronto como se incluye la posibilidad de acciones (o enunciados) de agentes autónomos, se pierde el determinismo. Habiendo mapeado la estructura normativa a un CPN, ahora agregamos modelos de CPN de las interacciones de los agentes. Cada forma de interacción de agentes (es decir, cada actividad) puede ser modelada utilizando CPNs siguiendo la línea de Cost et al. [5]. Estas CPN no determinísticas alimentan tokens en la CPN que modela la estructura normativa. Esto conlleva a la introducción de no determinismo en la CPN combinada. La mitad inferior de la figura 3 muestra parte de un modelo CPN de un protocolo de agente donde el arco denotado con 1 representa alguna enunciación de una ilocución por un agente. La transición objetivo de este arco, no solo mueve un <br>token</br> al siguiente estado de esta CPN, sino que también coloca un <br>token</br> en el lugar correspondiente a la escena normativa apropiada en el modelo CPN de la estructura normativa (a través del arco 2). La transición 3 finalmente pudo propagar ese <br>token</br> en forma de obligación, por ejemplo. Por lo tanto, a partir de una marca dada, son posibles muchas secuencias de ocurrencia diferentes dependiendo de las acciones de los agentes. Hacemos uso del conjunto de alcanzabilidad R para definir una situación en la que los agentes no pueden causar conflictos. 640 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) Figura 3: Construyendo la CPN combinada Def. 13. Dado una red N, una marcación M es resistente a conflictos si y solo si todas las marcaciones en R(N,M) son libres de conflictos. Verificar la libertad de conflicto de una marca se puede hacer en tiempo polinómico al revisar todos los lugares de la CPN en busca de fichas en conflicto. La libertad de conflicto de una secuencia de ocurrencias en la CPN que representa la estructura normativa también se puede lograr en tiempo polinómico, ya que esta secuencia es determinista dado un instante. Ya sea que una estructura normativa esté diseñada de manera segura corresponde a verificar la resistencia al conflicto de la marca inicial M0. Ahora, verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una marca se convierte en una tarea muy difícil. Corresponde al problema de alcanzabilidad en una CPN: ¿se puede alcanzar un estado o lograr una marcación que contenga un conflicto? Este problema de alcanzabilidad se sabe que es NP-completo para las Redes de Petri ordinarias [22] y dado que las CPNs son funcionalmente idénticas, no podemos esperar verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una estructura normativa fuera de línea en una cantidad razonable de tiempo. Por lo tanto, se necesitan mecanismos distribuidos en tiempo de ejecución para garantizar que una estructura normativa mantenga la consistencia. Presentamos un mecanismo de este tipo en la siguiente sección. 6. Una vez que se ha detectado un conflicto (según se define en la Sección 4), proponemos emplear el unificador para resolver el conflicto. En nuestro ejemplo, si las variables en prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) no obtienen los valores especificados en la sustitución σ, entonces no habrá un conflicto. Sin embargo, en lugar de calcular el conjunto complementario de una sustitución (que puede ser un conjunto infinito), proponemos anotar la prohibición con el unificador mismo y usarlo para determinar qué variables no pueden ser en futuras unificaciones para evitar un conflicto. Por lo tanto, designamos las prohibiciones anotadas como prh(¯I) Σ, donde Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, es un conjunto de unificadores. Las normas anotadas se interpretan como construcciones deónticas con influencias limitadas, es decir, su efecto (sobre agentes, roles e ilocuciones) ha sido restringido por el conjunto Σ de unificadores. Una prohibición puede estar en conflicto con varias obligaciones en una escena normativa dada s = id, Δ y necesitamos registrar (y posiblemente evitar) todos estos conflictos. A continuación definimos un algoritmo que garantiza que una posición normativa se agregará a una escena normativa de tal manera que no cause conflictos. Aunque proponemos reducir las prohibiciones, la misma maquinaria puede utilizarse para definir la reducción de obligaciones en su lugar. Estas políticas diferentes dependen de la semántica deontológica prevista y de los requisitos de los sistemas abordados. Por ejemplo, algunas MASs pueden requerir que sus agentes no actúen en presencia de conflictos, es decir, que la obligación debe ser limitada. 6.1 Resolución de Conflictos Proponemos una forma detallada de resolver conflictos normativos a través de la unificación. Detectamos la superposición de las influencias de las normas, es decir, cómo afectan el comportamiento de los agentes involucrados, y reducimos la influencia de la posición normativa, utilizando adecuadamente las anotaciones al verificar si la norma se aplica a las ilocuciones. El algoritmo mostrado en la Figura 4 representa cómo mantenemos un conjunto de normas libre de conflictos. Agrega una norma dada N a un estado normativo Δ existente y libre de conflictos, obteniendo un nuevo estado normativo resultante Δ que es libre de conflictos, es decir, sus prohibiciones están anotadas con un conjunto de conjuntos de conflictos que indican qué asignaciones para variables deben evitarse para que no ocurran conflictos. algoritmo addNorm(N, Δ) comienza 1 marca de tiempo(N) 2 caso N de 3 per(¯I): Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 4 prh(I): si N ∈ Δ tal que conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Δ := Δ 5 de lo contrario Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 6 prh(¯I): 7 comienza 8 Σ := ∅ 9 para cada N ∈ Δ hacer 10 si conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Σ := Σ ∪ {σ} 11 Δ := Δ ∪ {N Σ} 12 fin 13 obl(¯I): 14 comienza 15 Δ1 := ∅; Δ2 := ∅ 16 para cada (N Σ) ∈ Δ hacer 17 si N = prh(I) entonces 18 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 19 de lo contrario nulo 20 de lo contrario 21 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces 22 comienza 23 Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 24 Δ2 := Δ2 ∪ {N (Σ ∪ {σ})} 25 fin 26 Δ := (Δ − Δ1) ∪ Δ2 ∪ {N} 27 fin 28 fin caso 29 devolver Δ fin Figura 4: Algoritmo para Preservar la Libertad de Conflictos El algoritmo utiliza una estructura de caso para diferenciar las diferentes posibilidades para una norma dada N. La línea 3 aborda el caso en el que la norma dada es un permiso: N simplemente se agrega a Δ. Las líneas 4-5 abordan el caso en el que intentamos agregar una prohibición de base a un estado normativo: si entra en conflicto con alguna obligación, entonces se descarta; de lo contrario, se agrega al estado normativo. Las líneas 6-12 describen la situación cuando la posición normativa a añadir es una prohibición no fundamentada. En este caso, el algoritmo inicializa Σ como un conjunto vacío y recorre en bucle (línea 9-10) las normas N en el estado normativo anterior Δ. Al encontrar uno que entre en conflicto con N, el algoritmo actualiza Σ agregando el conjunto de conflictos recién encontrado σ a él (línea 10). Al recorrer Δ en un bucle, podemos verificar cualquier conflicto entre la nueva prohibición y las obligaciones existentes, construyendo adecuadamente la anotación Σ que se utilizará al agregar N a Δ en la línea 11. Las líneas 13-27 describen cómo una nueva obligación se adapta a un estado normativo existente. Hacemos uso de dos conjuntos temporales inicialmente vacíos, Δ1, Δ2. El algoritmo recorre Δ (líneas 16-25) recogiendo aquellas prohibiciones anotadas N Σ que entran en conflicto con la nueva obligación. Sin embargo, hay dos casos con los que tratar: uno cuando un terreno La Sexta Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se encuentra la prohibición 641 (línea 17) y su excepción, que abarca prohibiciones no fundamentadas (línea 20). En ambos casos, la antigua prohibición se almacena en Δ1 (líneas 18 y 23) para ser posteriormente eliminada de Δ (línea 26). Sin embargo, en el caso de una prohibición no basada en tierra, el algoritmo actualiza su anotación de conjuntos de conflictos (línea 24). El bucle garantiza que se realice una búsqueda exhaustiva (lineal) a través de un estado normativo, verificando si la nueva obligación entra en conflicto con alguna prohibición existente, posiblemente actualizando las anotaciones de estas prohibiciones conflictivas. En la línea 26, el algoritmo construye el nuevo Δ actualizado eliminando las antiguas prohibiciones almacenadas en Δ1 y agregando las prohibiciones actualizadas almacenadas en Δ2 (si las hay), así como la nueva obligación N. Nuestro algoritmo propuesto es correcto en el sentido de que, para una posición normativa N dada y un estado normativo Δ, proporciona un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que todas las prohibiciones tienen anotaciones que registran cómo se unifican con las obligaciones existentes. Las anotaciones pueden estar vacías, sin embargo, este es el caso cuando tenemos una prohibición de base o una prohibición que no unifica/conflicta con ninguna obligación. Los permisos no afectan nuestro algoritmo y se manejan adecuadamente (línea 3). Cualquier intento de insertar una prohibición de base que entre en conflicto, produce el mismo estado normativo (línea 4). Cuando se agrega una nueva obligación, el algoritmo garantiza que se consideren todas las prohibiciones (líneas 14-27), lo que lleva a la eliminación de prohibiciones fundamentales conflictivas o la actualización de anotaciones de prohibiciones no fundamentales. El algoritmo siempre termina: los bucles están sobre un conjunto finito Δ y las verificaciones de conflictos y operaciones de conjunto siempre terminan. La complejidad del algoritmo es lineal: el conjunto Δ solo se examina una vez para cada posible caso de norma que se agregue. Al gestionar estados normativos, también puede ser necesario eliminar posiciones normativas. Esto es sencillo: los permisos se pueden eliminar sin problemas; las prohibiciones anotadas también se pueden eliminar sin más consideraciones; sin embargo, las obligaciones requieren cierto mantenimiento. Cuando una obligación debe ser eliminada, debemos verificarla con todas las prohibiciones anotadas para actualizar sus anotaciones. Aplicamos la verificación de conflictos y obtenemos un unificador, luego eliminamos este unificador de la anotación de prohibiciones. Invocamos el algoritmo de eliminación como removeNorm(N, Δ): devuelve un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que se ha eliminado N, con posibles alteraciones en otras posiciones normativas como se explica. 6.2 Promulgación de una Estructura Normativa La promulgación de una estructura normativa implica la ejecución paralela y distribuida de escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Con fines ilustrativos, a continuación describiremos la interacción entre las escenas normativas de pago y entrega y la transición normativa nt que las vincula en la mitad superior de la figura 2. Con este objetivo, considere por ejemplo que obl(inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpago y que Δentrega sostiene prh(inform(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)). Tales estados indican que el cliente Jules está obligado a pagar £400 por 350 kg de cobre al contador Rod de acuerdo con la escena normativa de pago, mientras que Rod, asumiendo el papel de gerente de almacén en esta ocasión, tiene prohibido entregar cualquier cosa al cliente Jules de acuerdo con la escena normativa de entrega. Para cada escena normativa, el proceso de promulgación es el siguiente. En primer lugar, procesa su cola de mensajes entrantes que contiene tres tipos de mensajes: enunciados de la actividad a la que está vinculado; y comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar posiciones normativas. Por ejemplo, en nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago recopila la ilocución I = utt((inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), 35)) que representa al cliente Jules pendiente de pago por cobre (a través de la flecha A en la figura 2). Las expresiones son marcadas con la hora y luego se agregan al estado normativo. Tendríamos Δpago = Δpago ∪ {I}, en nuestro ejemplo. Al recibir comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar una posición normativa, la escena normativa invoca el algoritmo de adición o eliminación correspondiente descrito en la Sección 6.1. En segundo lugar, la escena normativa reconoce su cambio de estado al enviar un mensaje de activación a cada transición normativa saliente a la que está conectada. En nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago estaría señalando su cambio de estado a la transición normativa nt. Para las transiciones normativas, el proceso funciona de manera diferente. Debido a que cada transición normativa controla la operación de una regla única, al recibir un mensaje de activación, sondea cada escena normativa entrante en busca de sustituciones para los esquemas ilocucionales relevantes en el LHS de su regla. En nuestro ejemplo, nt (siendo responsable de la regla descrita en la Sección 3.4), sondearía la escena normativa de pagos (a través de la flecha B) en busca de sustituciones. Al recibir respuestas de ellos (en forma de conjuntos de sustituciones junto con marcas de tiempo), se deben unificar las sustituciones de cada una de estas escenas normativas. Para cada unificación que encuentra, la regla se activa, y por lo tanto se envía el comando normativo correspondiente a la escena normativa de salida. La transición normativa luego lleva un registro del mensaje de activación que envió y de los sellos de tiempo de las posiciones normativas que desencadenaron la activación. Esto se hace para asegurar que las mismas posiciones normativas en el LHS de una regla solo activen su disparo una vez. En nuestro ejemplo, nt estaría recibiendo σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} de la escena normativa de pago. Dado que las sustituciones en σ unifican con la regla nts, la regla se activa y se envía el comando normativo adicionar(entrega : obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350), T)) a la escena normativa de entrega para obligar a Rod a entregar al cliente Jules 350 kg de cobre. Después de eso, la escena normativa de entrega invocaría el algoritmo addNorm de la figura 4 con Δentrega y N = obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350)) como argumentos. 7. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Y CONCLUSIONES Nuestras contribuciones en este artículo son triples. En primer lugar, presentamos un enfoque para la gestión y razonamiento sobre normas de manera distribuida. Hasta donde sabemos, hay poco trabajo publicado en esta dirección. En [8, 21], se presentan dos idiomas para la aplicación distribuida de normas en MAS. Sin embargo, en ambos trabajos, cada agente tiene una interfaz de mensajes local que reenvía mensajes legales de acuerdo con un conjunto de normas. Dado que estas interfaces son locales para cada agente, las normas solo pueden expresarse en términos de acciones de ese agente. Esta es una seria desventaja, por ejemplo, cuando se necesita activar una obligación hacia un agente debido a un mensaje de otro. La segunda contribución es la propuesta de una estructura normativa. La noción es fructífera porque permite la separación de preocupaciones normativas y procedimentales. La estructura normativa que proponemos pone de manifiesto la similitud entre la propagación de posiciones normativas y la propagación 642 de la Sexta Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) de tokens en Redes de Petri de Colores. Esa similitud sugiere fácilmente un mapeo entre ambos, y proporciona fundamentos para un tratamiento analítico conveniente de la estructura normativa, en general, y la complejidad de la detección de conflictos, en particular. La idea de modelar interacciones (en forma de conversaciones) a través de Redes de Petri ha sido investigada en [18], donde el medio de interacción y los agentes individuales son modelados como subredes de CPN que posteriormente se combinan para su análisis. En [5], las conversaciones se diseñan y analizan primero a nivel de CPNs y luego se traducen a protocolos. Lin et al. [20] mapean los esquemas de conversación a CPNs. Hasta donde sabemos, el uso de esta representación en el apoyo a la detección de conflictos en MAS regulados no ha sido reportado en otro lugar. Finalmente, presentamos un mecanismo distribuido para resolver conflictos normativos. Sartor [25] aborda los conflictos normativos desde el punto de vista de la teoría legal y sugiere una forma de ordenar las normas involucradas. Su idea se implementa en [12] pero requiere un recurso central para el mantenimiento de la norma. El enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos es una adaptación y extensión del trabajo sobre grafos de instanciación reportado en [17] y un algoritmo relacionado en [27]. El algoritmo presentado en el artículo actual se puede utilizar para gestionar estados normativos de forma distribuida: escenas normativas que ocurren en paralelo tienen un estado normativo asociado Δ al cual el algoritmo se aplica de forma independiente cada vez que se introduce una nueva norma. Estas tres contribuciones que presentamos en este artículo abren muchas posibilidades para trabajos futuros. Deberíamos mencionar primero que, como estrategia general, estamos trabajando en una generalización de la noción de estructura normativa para hacerla operar con diferentes modelos de coordinación, con un contenido deóntico más rico y sobre diferentes realizaciones computacionales de MAS regulados. Como primer paso en esta dirección, estamos aprovechando el desacoplamiento entre los protocolos de interacción y la orientación normativa declarativa que la estructura normativa pone a disposición, para proporcionar una capa normativa para las instituciones electrónicas (como se define en [1]). Esperamos que dicho acoplamiento dote a las instituciones electrónicas de un entorno normativo más flexible y expresivo. Además, queremos ampliar nuestro modelo en varias direcciones: (1) para manejar la negación y restricciones como parte del lenguaje normativo, y en particular la noción de tiempo; (2) para acomodar múltiples autoridades normativas jerárquicas basadas en roles, siguiendo las líneas de Cholvy y Cuppens [3] y las relaciones de poder sugeridas por Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) para capturar en el algoritmo de resolución de conflictos diferentes semánticas relacionadas con las nociones deónticas mediante el apoyo a diferentes axiomatizaciones (por ejemplo, la fuerza relativa de la prohibición versus la obligación, nociones deónticas por defecto, inconsistencias deónticas). En el lado teórico, pretendemos utilizar técnicas de análisis de CPNs para caracterizar clases de CPNs (por ejemplo, acíclicos, simétricos, etc.) correspondientes a familias de Estructuras Normativas que son susceptibles a la detección de conflictos offline manejables. La combinación de estas técnicas junto con nuestros mecanismos en línea de resolución de conflictos tiene como objetivo dotar a los diseñadores de MAS con la capacidad de incorporar normas en sus sistemas de manera fundamentada.

                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",

                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",
                "The normative structure we propose makes evident the similarity between the propagation of normative positions and the propagation 642 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets.",
                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of <br>conflict</br> detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of <br>conflict</br> detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to <br>conflict</br> detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the <br>conflict</br> resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline <br>conflict</br> detection.",
                "The combination of these techniques along with our online <br>conflict</br> resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes.

Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado.

Lo demostramos formalizando la <br>noción de conflicto</br>, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs.

                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",
                "These conditions are either utterances or normative positions associated with a given protocol (denoted e.g. activity : utterance) which yield a normative command, i.e. the addition or removal of another normative position, possibly related to a different activity.",

                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

                "For instance, the sellers obligation above must flow (or be propagated) from a negotiation activity to a delivery activity.",

                "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
                "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",

                "We focus on an expressive class of MASs in which interaction is carried out by means of illocutionary speech acts exchanged among participating agents: Def. 3.",
                "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
                "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",
                "In the description of a protocol, for instance, the precise values of the message exchanged can be left unspecified.",
                "During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution.",

                "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request.",
                "Note that the state of a normative scene Δs evolves over time.",
                "These normative scenes are connected to one another via normative transitions that specify how utterances and normative positions in one scene affect other normative scenes.",
                "As mentioned above, activities are not independent since illocutions uttered in some of them may have an effect on other ones.",
                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",

                "Permissions do not affect our algorithm and they are appropriately dealt with (line 3).",
                "Any attempt to insert a ground prohibition which conflicts, yields the same normative state (line 4).",
                "When a new obligation is being added then the algorithm guarantees that all prohibitions are considered (lines 14-27), leading to the removal of conflicting ground prohibitions or the update of annotations of non-ground prohibitions.",
                "The algorithm always terminates: the loops are over a finite set Δ and the conflict checks and set operations always terminate.",
                "The complexity of the algorithm is linear: the set Δ is only examined once for each possible case of norm to be added.",
                "When managing normative states we may also need to remove normative positions.",
                "This is straightforward: permissions can be removed without any problems; annotated prohibitions can also be removed without further considerations; obligations, however, require some housekeeping.",
                "When an obligation is to be removed, we must check it against all annotated prohibitions in order to update their annotations.",
                "We apply the conflict check and obtain a unifier, then remove this unifier from the prohibitions annotation.",
                "We invoke the removal algorithm as removeNorm(N, Δ): it returns a new normative state Δ in which N has been removed, with possible alterations to other normative positions as explained. 6.2 Enactment of a Normative Structure The enactment of a normative structure amounts to the parallel, distributed execution of normative scenes and normative transitions.",
                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",

                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud. Ten en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa Δs evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás. Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo. Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6. Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una posición normativa (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Definición 7. Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una regla de transición normativa. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un grafo bipartito al que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas. Definición 8. Una estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout. Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1. Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativas describiendo cómo una regla cambia una escena normativa de una estructura normativa existente, dando como resultado una nueva estructura normativa. Cada regla se activa una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes. Una fórmula atómica (es decir, una enunciación o una posición normativa) se cumple si es unificable con una enunciación o posición normativa que pertenece al estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Cada vez que se activa una regla, se lleva a cabo el comando normativo especificado en el lado derecho de esa regla, con la intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa del estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Sin embargo, la adición no es incondicional ya que pueden surgir conflictos. Este tema será tratado en las Secciones 4 y 6.1. 638 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. En nuestro ejemplo en curso tenemos la siguiente regla de transición normativa ejemplar: \"pago: obl(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)), pago: utt(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)) « entrega: add(obl(informar(Y, wm, X, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)))\". Es decir, durante la actividad de pago, una obligación en el cliente X de informar al contador Y sobre el pago P del artículo Z en el tiempo T y la correspondiente declaración que cumple con esta obligación permite el flujo de una norma hacia la actividad de entrega. La norma es una obligación para el agente Y (en este caso asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) de enviar un mensaje al cliente X informando que el artículo Z ha sido entregado. Mostramos en la Figura 2 una representación diagramática de cómo se relacionan las actividades y una estructura normativa: Nivel Normativo Contrato de Entrega de Pago Salida Registro Pago Entrega Negociación Nivel de Coordinación Contrato nt Figura 2: Actividades y Estructura Normativa A medida que se emiten enunciados ilocucionarios durante las actividades, surgen posiciones normativas. Las expresiones y posiciones normativas se combinan en reglas de transición, causando el flujo de posiciones normativas entre escenas normativas. La conexión entre los dos niveles se describe en la Sección 6.2.4. DEFINICIÓN DE CONFLICTO Los términos conflicto deóntico e inconsistencia deóntica se han utilizado indistintamente en la literatura. Sin embargo, en este documento adoptamos la perspectiva de [7] en la que los autores sugieren que surge una inconsistencia deontológica cuando una acción es simultáneamente permitida y prohibida, ya que una permisión puede no ser llevada a cabo, por lo que no se produce un conflicto real. Las situaciones en las que una acción está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida son, sin embargo, conflictos deontológicos, ya que tanto las obligaciones como las prohibiciones influyen en los comportamientos de manera conflictiva. El contenido de las posiciones normativas en este documento son actos ilocutivos. Por lo tanto, surge un conflicto normativo cuando una ilocución está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida. Proponemos utilizar la noción estándar de unificación [9] para detectar cuándo se superponen una prohibición y un permiso. Por ejemplo, una obligación obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) y una prohibición prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T)) están en conflicto ya que se unifican bajo σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T}. Capturamos formalmente esta noción: Def. 9. Un conflicto (deóntico) surge entre dos posiciones normativas N y N bajo una sustitución σ, denotado como conflict(N, N, σ), si y solo si N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I) y unificar(¯I, ¯I, σ). Es decir, una prohibición y una obligación están en conflicto si, y solo si, sus ilocuciones se unifican bajo σ. La sustitución σ, llamada aquí el conjunto de conflictos, unifica a los agentes, roles y fórmulas atómicas. Suponemos que unificar es una implementación adecuada de un algoritmo de unificación que i) siempre termina (posiblemente fallando, si no se puede encontrar un unificador); ii) es correcto; y iii) tiene complejidad computacional lineal. Las inconsistencias causadas por la misma ilocución siendo simultáneamente permitida y prohibida pueden ser formalizadas de manera similar. En este artículo nos enfocamos en conflictos de prohibición/obligación, pero la maquinaria computacional introducida en la Sección 6.1 también puede ser utilizada para detectar inconsistencias de prohibición/permiso, si sustituimos la modalidad obl por per. 5. FORMALIZANDO LA LIBERTAD DE CONFLICTOS En esta sección introducimos algunos conocimientos previos sobre las CPN asumiendo una comprensión básica de las Redes de Petri ordinarias. Para detalles técnicos remitimos al lector a [16]. Luego mapeamos los NSs a los CPNs y analizamos sus propiedades. Las CPNs combinan la potencia de las redes de Petri con la potencia de los lenguajes de programación funcional. Por un lado, las redes de Petri proporcionan los elementos básicos para la descripción de la sincronización de procesos concurrentes. Como se observó en [16], las CPNs tienen una semántica que se basa en la concurrencia verdadera en lugar de la interlección. En nuestra opinión, una semántica de verdadera concurrencia es más fácil de trabajar porque es la forma en que imaginamos que debe ser la conexión entre el nivel de coordinación y el nivel normativo de un sistema multiagente. Por otro lado, los lenguajes de programación funcional utilizados por las CPNs proporcionan los elementos básicos para la definición de tipos de datos y la manipulación de sus valores de datos. Por lo tanto, podemos traducir fácilmente expresiones de una estructura normativa. Por último, pero no menos importante, las CPN tienen una semántica bien definida que define de manera inequívoca el comportamiento de cada CPN. Además, las CPNs cuentan con una gran cantidad de métodos y herramientas de análisis formales mediante los cuales se pueden demostrar propiedades de las CPNs. En resumen, las CPNs nos proporcionan todas las características necesarias para razonar formalmente sobre estructuras normativas siempre que se proporcione un mapeo adecuado. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri, los estados de una CPN se representan mediante lugares. Pero a diferencia de las Redes de Petri, cada lugar tiene un tipo de dato asociado que determina el tipo de datos que el lugar puede contener. Un estado de una CPN se llama marcado. Consiste en una serie de fichas colocadas en los lugares individuales. Cada token lleva consigo un valor de datos que tiene el tipo del lugar correspondiente. En general, un lugar puede contener dos o más fichas con el mismo valor de datos. Por lo tanto, una marca de una CPN es una función que asigna a cada plaza un multiconjunto de fichas del tipo correcto. Uno a menudo se refiere a los valores de los tokens como colores de tokens y también se refiere a los tipos de datos como conjuntos de colores. Los tipos de una CPN pueden ser arbitrariamente complejos. Las acciones en una CPN se representan mediante transiciones. Un arco entrante en una transición desde un lugar indica que la transición puede eliminar fichas del lugar correspondiente, mientras que un arco saliente indica que la transición puede agregar fichas. El número exacto de tokens y sus valores de datos son determinados por las expresiones de arco, las cuales están codificadas utilizando el lenguaje de programación elegido para la CPN. Una transición está habilitada en una CPN si y solo si el multi-conjunto (o bolsa) 2 A es una extensión de la noción de conjunto, permitiendo la posibilidad de múltiples apariciones del mismo elemento. El Sexto Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), 639 variables en las expresiones de sus arcos entrantes están vinculadas a algún valor (cada uno de estos vínculos se denomina elemento de vinculación). Si es así, la transición puede ocurrir al eliminar fichas de sus lugares de entrada y agregar fichas a sus lugares de salida. Además de las expresiones de arco, es posible adjuntar una expresión de guardia booleana (con variables) a cada transición. Al juntar todos los elementos anteriores, obtenemos una definición formal de CPN que se empleará más adelante con fines de mapeo. Definición 10. Un CPN es una tupla Σ, P, T, A, N, C, G, E, I donde: (i) Σ es un conjunto finito de tipos no vacíos, también llamados conjuntos de colores; (ii) P es un conjunto finito de lugares; (iii) T es un conjunto finito de transiciones; (iv) A es un conjunto finito de arcos; (v) N es una función de nodo definida de A en P × T ∪ T × P; (vi) C es una función de color de P en Σ; (vii) G es una función de guarda de T en expresiones; (viii) E es una función de expresión de arco de A en expresiones; (ix) I es una función de inicialización de P en expresiones cerradas; Nótese que la explicación informal de las reglas de habilitación y ocurrencia proporcionadas anteriormente sienta las bases para comprender el comportamiento de un CPN. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri ordinarias, el comportamiento concurrente de una CPN se basa en la noción de paso. Formalmente, un paso es un multi-conjunto no vacío y finito sobre el conjunto de todos los elementos de enlace. Sea el paso S habilitado en una marcación M. Entonces, S puede ocurrir, cambiando la marcación M a M'. Además, decimos que la marca M es directamente alcanzable desde la marca M mediante la ocurrencia del paso S, y lo denotamos como M[S > M. Una secuencia de ocurrencias finitas es una secuencia finita de pasos y marcas: M1[S1 > M2... Mn[Sn > Mn+1 tal que n ∈ N y Mi[Si > Mi+1 ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. \n\n(Note: The original sentence seems to have a typo or missing information, as it is not complete or clear in its meaning.) El conjunto de todas las marcas posibles alcanzables para una red Net desde una marca M se llama su conjunto de alcanzabilidad, y se denota como R(Net, M). 5.1 Mapeo a Redes de Petri Coloreadas. Nuestra estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado. Lo mismo es cierto para una Red de Petri de Colores. Estamos presentando un mapeo f de uno a otro, con el fin de proporcionar semántica para la estructura normativa y demostrar propiedades sobre ella utilizando resultados teóricos bien conocidos del trabajo en CPNs. El mapeo f hace uso de correspondencias entre escenas normativas y lugares de CPN, transiciones normativas y transiciones de CPN y finalmente, entre etiquetas de arco y expresiones de arco de CPN. S → P B → T Lin ∪ Lout → E El conjunto de tipos es el conjunto unitario que contiene el color NP (es decir, Σ = {NP}). Este tipo complejo está estructurado de la siguiente manera (usamos la sintaxis CPN-ML [4]): color NPT = con Obl | Per | Prh | NoMod color IP = con informar | declarar | ofrecer color UTT = registro illp: IP ag1, rol1, ag2, rol2: cadena contenido: cadena tiempo: entero color NP = registro modo: NPT ilocución: UTT Modelar las ilocuciones como normas sin modalidad (NoMod) es un truco formal que utilizamos para asegurar que las subredes puedan combinarse como se explica a continuación. Los arcos son mapeados casi directamente. A es un conjunto finito de arcos y N es una función de nodo, tal que ∀a ∈ A ∃a ∈ Ain ∪Aout. N(a) = a. La función de inicialización I se define como I(p) = Δs (∀s ∈ S donde p se obtiene de s usando el mapeo; recuerda que s = ids, Δs). Finalmente, la función de color C asigna el color NP a cada lugar: C(p) = NP (∀p ∈ P). No estamos haciendo uso de la función de guardia G. En trabajos futuros, esta función puede ser utilizada para modelar restricciones cuando ampliemos la expresividad de nuestro lenguaje normativo. 5.2 Propiedades de Estructuras Normativas Habiendo definido la asignación de estructuras normativas a Redes de Petri de Colores, ahora examinamos propiedades de las RPC que nos ayudan a comprender la complejidad de la detección de conflictos. Una pregunta que nos gustaría responder es si, en un momento dado, una estructura normativa dada está libre de conflictos. Una instantánea de una estructura normativa corresponde a una marca en la CPN mapeada. Definición 11. Dada una marcación Mi, esta marcación es libre de conflictos si ¬∃p ∈ P. ∃np1, np2 ∈ Mi(p) tal que np1.modo = Obl y np2.modo = Prh y np1.illoc y np2.illoc unifican bajo una sustitución válida. Otra pregunta interesante sería si surgirá un conflicto a partir de tal instantánea del sistema al propagar las posiciones normativas. Para responder a esta pregunta, primero traducimos la instantánea de la estructura normativa al CPN correspondiente y luego ejecutamos la secuencia finita de ocurrencias de marcas y pasos, verificando la ausencia de conflictos en cada marca a medida que avanzamos. Definición 12. Dada una marca Mi, una secuencia finita de ocurrencias Si, Si+1, ..., Sn se llama libre de conflictos, si y solo si Mi[Si > Mi+1 . . . Mn[Sn > Mn+1 y Mk es libre de conflictos para todo k tal que i ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Sin embargo, la pregunta principal que nos gustaría investigar es si una estructura normativa dada es resistente al conflicto, es decir, si los agentes que implementan el MAS son capaces de generar conflictos a través de sus acciones. Tan pronto como se incluye la posibilidad de acciones (o enunciados) de agentes autónomos, se pierde el determinismo. Habiendo mapeado la estructura normativa a un CPN, ahora agregamos modelos de CPN de las interacciones de los agentes. Cada forma de interacción de agentes (es decir, cada actividad) puede ser modelada utilizando CPNs siguiendo la línea de Cost et al. [5]. Estas CPN no determinísticas alimentan tokens en la CPN que modela la estructura normativa. Esto conlleva a la introducción de no determinismo en la CPN combinada. La mitad inferior de la figura 3 muestra parte de un modelo CPN de un protocolo de agente donde el arco denotado con 1 representa alguna enunciación de una ilocución por un agente. La transición objetivo de este arco, no solo mueve un token al siguiente estado de esta CPN, sino que también coloca un token en el lugar correspondiente a la escena normativa apropiada en el modelo CPN de la estructura normativa (a través del arco 2). La transición 3 finalmente pudo propagar ese token en forma de obligación, por ejemplo. Por lo tanto, a partir de una marca dada, son posibles muchas secuencias de ocurrencia diferentes dependiendo de las acciones de los agentes. Hacemos uso del conjunto de alcanzabilidad R para definir una situación en la que los agentes no pueden causar conflictos. 640 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) Figura 3: Construyendo la CPN combinada Def. 13. Dado una red N, una marcación M es resistente a conflictos si y solo si todas las marcaciones en R(N,M) son libres de conflictos. Verificar la libertad de conflicto de una marca se puede hacer en tiempo polinómico al revisar todos los lugares de la CPN en busca de fichas en conflicto. La libertad de conflicto de una secuencia de ocurrencias en la CPN que representa la estructura normativa también se puede lograr en tiempo polinómico, ya que esta secuencia es determinista dado un instante. Ya sea que una estructura normativa esté diseñada de manera segura corresponde a verificar la resistencia al conflicto de la marca inicial M0. Ahora, verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una marca se convierte en una tarea muy difícil. Corresponde al problema de alcanzabilidad en una CPN: ¿se puede alcanzar un estado o lograr una marcación que contenga un conflicto? Este problema de alcanzabilidad se sabe que es NP-completo para las Redes de Petri ordinarias [22] y dado que las CPNs son funcionalmente idénticas, no podemos esperar verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una estructura normativa fuera de línea en una cantidad razonable de tiempo. Por lo tanto, se necesitan mecanismos distribuidos en tiempo de ejecución para garantizar que una estructura normativa mantenga la consistencia. Presentamos un mecanismo de este tipo en la siguiente sección. 6. Una vez que se ha detectado un conflicto (según se define en la Sección 4), proponemos emplear el unificador para resolver el conflicto. En nuestro ejemplo, si las variables en prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) no obtienen los valores especificados en la sustitución σ, entonces no habrá un conflicto. Sin embargo, en lugar de calcular el conjunto complementario de una sustitución (que puede ser un conjunto infinito), proponemos anotar la prohibición con el unificador mismo y usarlo para determinar qué variables no pueden ser en futuras unificaciones para evitar un conflicto. Por lo tanto, designamos las prohibiciones anotadas como prh(¯I) Σ, donde Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, es un conjunto de unificadores. Las normas anotadas se interpretan como construcciones deónticas con influencias limitadas, es decir, su efecto (sobre agentes, roles e ilocuciones) ha sido restringido por el conjunto Σ de unificadores. Una prohibición puede estar en conflicto con varias obligaciones en una escena normativa dada s = id, Δ y necesitamos registrar (y posiblemente evitar) todos estos conflictos. A continuación definimos un algoritmo que garantiza que una posición normativa se agregará a una escena normativa de tal manera que no cause conflictos. Aunque proponemos reducir las prohibiciones, la misma maquinaria puede utilizarse para definir la reducción de obligaciones en su lugar. Estas políticas diferentes dependen de la semántica deontológica prevista y de los requisitos de los sistemas abordados. Por ejemplo, algunas MASs pueden requerir que sus agentes no actúen en presencia de conflictos, es decir, que la obligación debe ser limitada. 6.1 Resolución de Conflictos Proponemos una forma detallada de resolver conflictos normativos a través de la unificación. Detectamos la superposición de las influencias de las normas, es decir, cómo afectan el comportamiento de los agentes involucrados, y reducimos la influencia de la posición normativa, utilizando adecuadamente las anotaciones al verificar si la norma se aplica a las ilocuciones. El algoritmo mostrado en la Figura 4 representa cómo mantenemos un conjunto de normas libre de conflictos. Agrega una norma dada N a un estado normativo Δ existente y libre de conflictos, obteniendo un nuevo estado normativo resultante Δ que es libre de conflictos, es decir, sus prohibiciones están anotadas con un conjunto de conjuntos de conflictos que indican qué asignaciones para variables deben evitarse para que no ocurran conflictos. algoritmo addNorm(N, Δ) comienza 1 marca de tiempo(N) 2 caso N de 3 per(¯I): Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 4 prh(I): si N ∈ Δ tal que conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Δ := Δ 5 de lo contrario Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 6 prh(¯I): 7 comienza 8 Σ := ∅ 9 para cada N ∈ Δ hacer 10 si conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Σ := Σ ∪ {σ} 11 Δ := Δ ∪ {N Σ} 12 fin 13 obl(¯I): 14 comienza 15 Δ1 := ∅; Δ2 := ∅ 16 para cada (N Σ) ∈ Δ hacer 17 si N = prh(I) entonces 18 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 19 de lo contrario nulo 20 de lo contrario 21 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces 22 comienza 23 Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 24 Δ2 := Δ2 ∪ {N (Σ ∪ {σ})} 25 fin 26 Δ := (Δ − Δ1) ∪ Δ2 ∪ {N} 27 fin 28 fin caso 29 devolver Δ fin Figura 4: Algoritmo para Preservar la Libertad de Conflictos El algoritmo utiliza una estructura de caso para diferenciar las diferentes posibilidades para una norma dada N. La línea 3 aborda el caso en el que la norma dada es un permiso: N simplemente se agrega a Δ. Las líneas 4-5 abordan el caso en el que intentamos agregar una prohibición de base a un estado normativo: si entra en conflicto con alguna obligación, entonces se descarta; de lo contrario, se agrega al estado normativo. Las líneas 6-12 describen la situación cuando la posición normativa a añadir es una prohibición no fundamentada. En este caso, el algoritmo inicializa Σ como un conjunto vacío y recorre en bucle (línea 9-10) las normas N en el estado normativo anterior Δ. Al encontrar uno que entre en conflicto con N, el algoritmo actualiza Σ agregando el conjunto de conflictos recién encontrado σ a él (línea 10). Al recorrer Δ en un bucle, podemos verificar cualquier conflicto entre la nueva prohibición y las obligaciones existentes, construyendo adecuadamente la anotación Σ que se utilizará al agregar N a Δ en la línea 11. Las líneas 13-27 describen cómo una nueva obligación se adapta a un estado normativo existente. Hacemos uso de dos conjuntos temporales inicialmente vacíos, Δ1, Δ2. El algoritmo recorre Δ (líneas 16-25) recogiendo aquellas prohibiciones anotadas N Σ que entran en conflicto con la nueva obligación. Sin embargo, hay dos casos con los que tratar: uno cuando un terreno La Sexta Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se encuentra la prohibición 641 (línea 17) y su excepción, que abarca prohibiciones no fundamentadas (línea 20). En ambos casos, la antigua prohibición se almacena en Δ1 (líneas 18 y 23) para ser posteriormente eliminada de Δ (línea 26). Sin embargo, en el caso de una prohibición no basada en tierra, el algoritmo actualiza su anotación de conjuntos de conflictos (línea 24). El bucle garantiza que se realice una búsqueda exhaustiva (lineal) a través de un estado normativo, verificando si la nueva obligación entra en conflicto con alguna prohibición existente, posiblemente actualizando las anotaciones de estas prohibiciones conflictivas. En la línea 26, el algoritmo construye el nuevo Δ actualizado eliminando las antiguas prohibiciones almacenadas en Δ1 y agregando las prohibiciones actualizadas almacenadas en Δ2 (si las hay), así como la nueva obligación N. Nuestro algoritmo propuesto es correcto en el sentido de que, para una posición normativa N dada y un estado normativo Δ, proporciona un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que todas las prohibiciones tienen anotaciones que registran cómo se unifican con las obligaciones existentes. Las anotaciones pueden estar vacías, sin embargo, este es el caso cuando tenemos una prohibición de base o una prohibición que no unifica/conflicta con ninguna obligación. Los permisos no afectan nuestro algoritmo y se manejan adecuadamente (línea 3). Cualquier intento de insertar una prohibición de base que entre en conflicto, produce el mismo estado normativo (línea 4). Cuando se agrega una nueva obligación, el algoritmo garantiza que se consideren todas las prohibiciones (líneas 14-27), lo que lleva a la eliminación de prohibiciones fundamentales conflictivas o la actualización de anotaciones de prohibiciones no fundamentales. El algoritmo siempre termina: los bucles están sobre un conjunto finito Δ y las verificaciones de conflictos y operaciones de conjunto siempre terminan. La complejidad del algoritmo es lineal: el conjunto Δ solo se examina una vez para cada posible caso de norma que se agregue. Al gestionar estados normativos, también puede ser necesario eliminar posiciones normativas. Esto es sencillo: los permisos se pueden eliminar sin problemas; las prohibiciones anotadas también se pueden eliminar sin más consideraciones; sin embargo, las obligaciones requieren cierto mantenimiento. Cuando una obligación debe ser eliminada, debemos verificarla con todas las prohibiciones anotadas para actualizar sus anotaciones. Aplicamos la verificación de conflictos y obtenemos un unificador, luego eliminamos este unificador de la anotación de prohibiciones. Invocamos el algoritmo de eliminación como removeNorm(N, Δ): devuelve un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que se ha eliminado N, con posibles alteraciones en otras posiciones normativas como se explica. 6.2 Promulgación de una Estructura Normativa La promulgación de una estructura normativa implica la ejecución paralela y distribuida de escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Con fines ilustrativos, a continuación describiremos la interacción entre las escenas normativas de pago y entrega y la transición normativa nt que las vincula en la mitad superior de la figura 2. Con este objetivo, considere por ejemplo que obl(inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpago y que Δentrega sostiene prh(inform(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)). Tales estados indican que el cliente Jules está obligado a pagar £400 por 350 kg de cobre al contador Rod de acuerdo con la escena normativa de pago, mientras que Rod, asumiendo el papel de gerente de almacén en esta ocasión, tiene prohibido entregar cualquier cosa al cliente Jules de acuerdo con la escena normativa de entrega. Para cada escena normativa, el proceso de promulgación es el siguiente. En primer lugar, procesa su cola de mensajes entrantes que contiene tres tipos de mensajes: enunciados de la actividad a la que está vinculado; y comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar posiciones normativas. Por ejemplo, en nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago recopila la ilocución I = utt((inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), 35)) que representa al cliente Jules pendiente de pago por cobre (a través de la flecha A en la figura 2). Las expresiones son marcadas con la hora y luego se agregan al estado normativo. Tendríamos Δpago = Δpago ∪ {I}, en nuestro ejemplo. Al recibir comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar una posición normativa, la escena normativa invoca el algoritmo de adición o eliminación correspondiente descrito en la Sección 6.1. En segundo lugar, la escena normativa reconoce su cambio de estado al enviar un mensaje de activación a cada transición normativa saliente a la que está conectada. En nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago estaría señalando su cambio de estado a la transición normativa nt. Para las transiciones normativas, el proceso funciona de manera diferente. Debido a que cada transición normativa controla la operación de una regla única, al recibir un mensaje de activación, sondea cada escena normativa entrante en busca de sustituciones para los esquemas ilocucionales relevantes en el LHS de su regla. En nuestro ejemplo, nt (siendo responsable de la regla descrita en la Sección 3.4), sondearía la escena normativa de pagos (a través de la flecha B) en busca de sustituciones. Al recibir respuestas de ellos (en forma de conjuntos de sustituciones junto con marcas de tiempo), se deben unificar las sustituciones de cada una de estas escenas normativas. Para cada unificación que encuentra, la regla se activa, y por lo tanto se envía el comando normativo correspondiente a la escena normativa de salida. La transición normativa luego lleva un registro del mensaje de activación que envió y de los sellos de tiempo de las posiciones normativas que desencadenaron la activación. Esto se hace para asegurar que las mismas posiciones normativas en el LHS de una regla solo activen su disparo una vez. En nuestro ejemplo, nt estaría recibiendo σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} de la escena normativa de pago. Dado que las sustituciones en σ unifican con la regla nts, la regla se activa y se envía el comando normativo adicionar(entrega : obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350), T)) a la escena normativa de entrega para obligar a Rod a entregar al cliente Jules 350 kg de cobre. Después de eso, la escena normativa de entrega invocaría el algoritmo addNorm de la figura 4 con Δentrega y N = obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350)) como argumentos. 7. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Y CONCLUSIONES Nuestras contribuciones en este artículo son triples. En primer lugar, presentamos un enfoque para la gestión y razonamiento sobre normas de manera distribuida. Hasta donde sabemos, hay poco trabajo publicado en esta dirección. En [8, 21], se presentan dos idiomas para la aplicación distribuida de normas en MAS. Sin embargo, en ambos trabajos, cada agente tiene una interfaz de mensajes local que reenvía mensajes legales de acuerdo con un conjunto de normas. Dado que estas interfaces son locales para cada agente, las normas solo pueden expresarse en términos de acciones de ese agente. Esta es una seria desventaja, por ejemplo, cuando se necesita activar una obligación hacia un agente debido a un mensaje de otro. La segunda contribución es la propuesta de una estructura normativa. La noción es fructífera porque permite la separación de preocupaciones normativas y procedimentales. La estructura normativa que proponemos pone de manifiesto la similitud entre la propagación de posiciones normativas y la propagación 642 de la Sexta Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) de tokens en Redes de Petri de Colores. Esa similitud sugiere fácilmente un mapeo entre ambos, y proporciona fundamentos para un tratamiento analítico conveniente de la estructura normativa, en general, y la complejidad de la detección de conflictos, en particular. La idea de modelar interacciones (en forma de conversaciones) a través de Redes de Petri ha sido investigada en [18], donde el medio de interacción y los agentes individuales son modelados como subredes de CPN que posteriormente se combinan para su análisis. En [5], las conversaciones se diseñan y analizan primero a nivel de CPNs y luego se traducen a protocolos. Lin et al. [20] mapean los esquemas de conversación a CPNs. Hasta donde sabemos, el uso de esta representación en el apoyo a la detección de conflictos en MAS regulados no ha sido reportado en otro lugar. Finalmente, presentamos un mecanismo distribuido para resolver conflictos normativos. Sartor [25] aborda los conflictos normativos desde el punto de vista de la teoría legal y sugiere una forma de ordenar las normas involucradas. Su idea se implementa en [12] pero requiere un recurso central para el mantenimiento de la norma. El enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos es una adaptación y extensión del trabajo sobre grafos de instanciación reportado en [17] y un algoritmo relacionado en [27]. El algoritmo presentado en el artículo actual se puede utilizar para gestionar estados normativos de forma distribuida: escenas normativas que ocurren en paralelo tienen un estado normativo asociado Δ al cual el algoritmo se aplica de forma independiente cada vez que se introduce una nueva norma. Estas tres contribuciones que presentamos en este artículo abren muchas posibilidades para trabajos futuros. Deberíamos mencionar primero que, como estrategia general, estamos trabajando en una generalización de la noción de estructura normativa para hacerla operar con diferentes modelos de coordinación, con un contenido deóntico más rico y sobre diferentes realizaciones computacionales de MAS regulados. Como primer paso en esta dirección, estamos aprovechando el desacoplamiento entre los protocolos de interacción y la orientación normativa declarativa que la estructura normativa pone a disposición, para proporcionar una capa normativa para las instituciones electrónicas (como se define en [1]). Esperamos que dicho acoplamiento dote a las instituciones electrónicas de un entorno normativo más flexible y expresivo. Además, queremos ampliar nuestro modelo en varias direcciones: (1) para manejar la negación y restricciones como parte del lenguaje normativo, y en particular la noción de tiempo; (2) para acomodar múltiples autoridades normativas jerárquicas basadas en roles, siguiendo las líneas de Cholvy y Cuppens [3] y las relaciones de poder sugeridas por Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) para capturar en el algoritmo de resolución de conflictos diferentes semánticas relacionadas con las nociones deónticas mediante el apoyo a diferentes axiomatizaciones (por ejemplo, la fuerza relativa de la prohibición versus la obligación, nociones deónticas por defecto, inconsistencias deónticas). En el lado teórico, pretendemos utilizar técnicas de análisis de CPNs para caracterizar clases de CPNs (por ejemplo, acíclicos, simétricos, etc.) correspondientes a familias de Estructuras Normativas que son susceptibles a la detección de conflictos offline manejables. La combinación de estas técnicas junto con nuestros mecanismos en línea de resolución de conflictos tiene como objetivo dotar a los diseñadores de MAS con la capacidad de incorporar normas en sus sistemas de manera fundamentada.

                "Recently, these systems have been successfully used to define agent architectures [11, 23].",
                "The metaphor translates to our current work as follows: the utterance of illocutions and/or the existence of normative positions in some normative scenes leads to the deduction of normative positions in other normative scenes.",

                "We take normative scenes to be sets of normative positions and utterances that are associated with an underlying interaction protocol corresponding to an activity.",
                "In this section, we first present a simple language capturing these aspects and formally introduce the notions of normative scene, normative transition rule and normative structure.",
                "We give the intended semantics of these rules and show how to control a MAS via norms in an example. 3.1 Basic Concepts The building blocks of our language are terms and atomic formulae: Def. 1.",
                "A term, denoted as t, is (i) any constant expressed using lowercase (with or without subscripts), e.g. a, b0, c or (ii) any variable expressed using uppercase (with or without subscripts), e.g.",

                "We will be making use of identifiers throughout the paper, which are constant terms and also need the following definition: Def. 2.",
                "An atomic formula is any construct p(t1, . . . , tn), where p is an n-ary predicate symbol and t1, . . . , tn are terms.",
                "The set of all atomic formulae is denoted as Δ.",
                "We focus on an expressive class of MASs in which interaction is carried out by means of illocutionary speech acts exchanged among participating agents: Def. 3.",
                "Illocutions I are ground atomic formulae which have the form p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) where p is an element of 1 Here, we abstract from protocols and refer to them generically as activities.",

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
                "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",
                "In the description of a protocol, for instance, the precise values of the message exchanged can be left unspecified.",
                "During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution.",
                "We can thus define illocution schemata: Def. 4.",
                "An illocution schema ¯I is any atomic formula p(ag, r, ag , r , δ, t) in which some of the terms may either be variables or may contain variables. 3.2 Formal Definition of the Notion of NS We first define normative scenes as follows: Def. 5.",
                "A normative scene is a tuple s = ids, Δs where ids is a scene identifier and Δs is the set of atomic formulae δ (i.e. utterances and normative positions) that hold in s. We will also refer to Δs as the state of normative scene s. For instance, a snapshot of the state of the delivery normative scene of our scenario could be represented as: Δs = 8 < : utt(request(sean, client, kev, wm, receive(wire, 200), 20)), utt(accept(kev, wm, sean, client, receive(wire, 200), 30)), obl(inform(kev, wm, sean, client, delivered(wire, 200), 30)) 9 = ; That is, agent Sean taking up the client role has requested agent Kev (taking up the warehouse manager role wm) to receive 200kg of wire, and agent Kev is obliged to deliver 200kg of wire to Sean since he accepted the request.",
                "Note that the state of a normative scene Δs evolves over time.",
                "These normative scenes are connected to one another via normative transitions that specify how utterances and normative positions in one scene affect other normative scenes.",
                "As mentioned above, activities are not independent since illocutions uttered in some of them may have an effect on other ones.",
                "Normative transition rules define the conditions under which a normative command is generated.",

                "Permissions do not affect our algorithm and they are appropriately dealt with (line 3).",
                "Any attempt to insert a ground prohibition which conflicts, yields the same normative state (line 4).",
                "When a new obligation is being added then the algorithm guarantees that all prohibitions are considered (lines 14-27), leading to the removal of conflicting ground prohibitions or the update of annotations of non-ground prohibitions.",
                "The algorithm always terminates: the loops are over a finite set Δ and the conflict checks and set operations always terminate.",
                "The complexity of the algorithm is linear: the set Δ is only examined once for each possible case of norm to be added.",
                "When managing normative states we may also need to remove normative positions.",
                "This is straightforward: permissions can be removed without any problems; annotated prohibitions can also be removed without further considerations; obligations, however, require some housekeeping.",
                "When an obligation is to be removed, we must check it against all annotated prohibitions in order to update their annotations.",
                "We apply the conflict check and obtain a unifier, then remove this unifier from the prohibitions annotation.",
                "We invoke the removal algorithm as removeNorm(N, Δ): it returns a new normative state Δ in which N has been removed, with possible alterations to other normative positions as explained. 6.2 Enactment of a Normative Structure The enactment of a normative structure amounts to the parallel, distributed execution of normative scenes and normative transitions.",
                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",

                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",

                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el nivel de coordinación (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud. Ten en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa Δs evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás. Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo. Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6. Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una posición normativa (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Definición 7. Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una regla de transición normativa. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un grafo bipartito al que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas. Definición 8. Una estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout. Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1. Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativas describiendo cómo una regla cambia una escena normativa de una estructura normativa existente, dando como resultado una nueva estructura normativa. Cada regla se activa una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes. Una fórmula atómica (es decir, una enunciación o una posición normativa) se cumple si es unificable con una enunciación o posición normativa que pertenece al estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Cada vez que se activa una regla, se lleva a cabo el comando normativo especificado en el lado derecho de esa regla, con la intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa del estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Sin embargo, la adición no es incondicional ya que pueden surgir conflictos. Este tema será tratado en las Secciones 4 y 6.1. 638 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. En nuestro ejemplo en curso tenemos la siguiente regla de transición normativa ejemplar: \"pago: obl(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)), pago: utt(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)) « entrega: add(obl(informar(Y, wm, X, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)))\". Es decir, durante la actividad de pago, una obligación en el cliente X de informar al contador Y sobre el pago P del artículo Z en el tiempo T y la correspondiente declaración que cumple con esta obligación permite el flujo de una norma hacia la actividad de entrega. La norma es una obligación para el agente Y (en este caso asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) de enviar un mensaje al cliente X informando que el artículo Z ha sido entregado. Mostramos en la Figura 2 una representación diagramática de cómo se relacionan las actividades y una estructura normativa: Nivel Normativo Contrato de Entrega de Pago Salida Registro Pago Entrega Negociación Nivel de Coordinación Contrato nt Figura 2: Actividades y Estructura Normativa A medida que se emiten enunciados ilocucionarios durante las actividades, surgen posiciones normativas. Las expresiones y posiciones normativas se combinan en reglas de transición, causando el flujo de posiciones normativas entre escenas normativas. La conexión entre los dos niveles se describe en la Sección 6.2.4. DEFINICIÓN DE CONFLICTO Los términos conflicto deóntico e inconsistencia deóntica se han utilizado indistintamente en la literatura. Sin embargo, en este documento adoptamos la perspectiva de [7] en la que los autores sugieren que surge una inconsistencia deontológica cuando una acción es simultáneamente permitida y prohibida, ya que una permisión puede no ser llevada a cabo, por lo que no se produce un conflicto real. Las situaciones en las que una acción está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida son, sin embargo, conflictos deontológicos, ya que tanto las obligaciones como las prohibiciones influyen en los comportamientos de manera conflictiva. El contenido de las posiciones normativas en este documento son actos ilocutivos. Por lo tanto, surge un conflicto normativo cuando una ilocución está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida. Proponemos utilizar la noción estándar de unificación [9] para detectar cuándo se superponen una prohibición y un permiso. Por ejemplo, una obligación obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) y una prohibición prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T)) están en conflicto ya que se unifican bajo σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T}. Capturamos formalmente esta noción: Def. 9. Un conflicto (deóntico) surge entre dos posiciones normativas N y N bajo una sustitución σ, denotado como conflict(N, N, σ), si y solo si N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I) y unificar(¯I, ¯I, σ). Es decir, una prohibición y una obligación están en conflicto si, y solo si, sus ilocuciones se unifican bajo σ. La sustitución σ, llamada aquí el conjunto de conflictos, unifica a los agentes, roles y fórmulas atómicas. Suponemos que unificar es una implementación adecuada de un algoritmo de unificación que i) siempre termina (posiblemente fallando, si no se puede encontrar un unificador); ii) es correcto; y iii) tiene complejidad computacional lineal. Las inconsistencias causadas por la misma ilocución siendo simultáneamente permitida y prohibida pueden ser formalizadas de manera similar. En este artículo nos enfocamos en conflictos de prohibición/obligación, pero la maquinaria computacional introducida en la Sección 6.1 también puede ser utilizada para detectar inconsistencias de prohibición/permiso, si sustituimos la modalidad obl por per. 5. FORMALIZANDO LA LIBERTAD DE CONFLICTOS En esta sección introducimos algunos conocimientos previos sobre las CPN asumiendo una comprensión básica de las Redes de Petri ordinarias. Para detalles técnicos remitimos al lector a [16]. Luego mapeamos los NSs a los CPNs y analizamos sus propiedades. Las CPNs combinan la potencia de las redes de Petri con la potencia de los lenguajes de programación funcional. Por un lado, las redes de Petri proporcionan los elementos básicos para la descripción de la sincronización de procesos concurrentes. Como se observó en [16], las CPNs tienen una semántica que se basa en la concurrencia verdadera en lugar de la interlección. En nuestra opinión, una semántica de verdadera concurrencia es más fácil de trabajar porque es la forma en que imaginamos que debe ser la conexión entre el nivel de coordinación y el nivel normativo de un sistema multiagente. Por otro lado, los lenguajes de programación funcional utilizados por las CPNs proporcionan los elementos básicos para la definición de tipos de datos y la manipulación de sus valores de datos. Por lo tanto, podemos traducir fácilmente expresiones de una estructura normativa. Por último, pero no menos importante, las CPN tienen una semántica bien definida que define de manera inequívoca el comportamiento de cada CPN. Además, las CPNs cuentan con una gran cantidad de métodos y herramientas de análisis formales mediante los cuales se pueden demostrar propiedades de las CPNs. En resumen, las CPNs nos proporcionan todas las características necesarias para razonar formalmente sobre estructuras normativas siempre que se proporcione un mapeo adecuado. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri, los estados de una CPN se representan mediante lugares. Pero a diferencia de las Redes de Petri, cada lugar tiene un tipo de dato asociado que determina el tipo de datos que el lugar puede contener. Un estado de una CPN se llama marcado. Consiste en una serie de fichas colocadas en los lugares individuales. Cada token lleva consigo un valor de datos que tiene el tipo del lugar correspondiente. En general, un lugar puede contener dos o más fichas con el mismo valor de datos. Por lo tanto, una marca de una CPN es una función que asigna a cada plaza un multiconjunto de fichas del tipo correcto. Uno a menudo se refiere a los valores de los tokens como colores de tokens y también se refiere a los tipos de datos como conjuntos de colores. Los tipos de una CPN pueden ser arbitrariamente complejos. Las acciones en una CPN se representan mediante transiciones. Un arco entrante en una transición desde un lugar indica que la transición puede eliminar fichas del lugar correspondiente, mientras que un arco saliente indica que la transición puede agregar fichas. El número exacto de tokens y sus valores de datos son determinados por las expresiones de arco, las cuales están codificadas utilizando el lenguaje de programación elegido para la CPN. Una transición está habilitada en una CPN si y solo si el multi-conjunto (o bolsa) 2 A es una extensión de la noción de conjunto, permitiendo la posibilidad de múltiples apariciones del mismo elemento. El Sexto Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), 639 variables en las expresiones de sus arcos entrantes están vinculadas a algún valor (cada uno de estos vínculos se denomina elemento de vinculación). Si es así, la transición puede ocurrir al eliminar fichas de sus lugares de entrada y agregar fichas a sus lugares de salida. Además de las expresiones de arco, es posible adjuntar una expresión de guardia booleana (con variables) a cada transición. Al juntar todos los elementos anteriores, obtenemos una definición formal de CPN que se empleará más adelante con fines de mapeo. Definición 10. Un CPN es una tupla Σ, P, T, A, N, C, G, E, I donde: (i) Σ es un conjunto finito de tipos no vacíos, también llamados conjuntos de colores; (ii) P es un conjunto finito de lugares; (iii) T es un conjunto finito de transiciones; (iv) A es un conjunto finito de arcos; (v) N es una función de nodo definida de A en P × T ∪ T × P; (vi) C es una función de color de P en Σ; (vii) G es una función de guarda de T en expresiones; (viii) E es una función de expresión de arco de A en expresiones; (ix) I es una función de inicialización de P en expresiones cerradas; Nótese que la explicación informal de las reglas de habilitación y ocurrencia proporcionadas anteriormente sienta las bases para comprender el comportamiento de un CPN. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri ordinarias, el comportamiento concurrente de una CPN se basa en la noción de paso. Formalmente, un paso es un multi-conjunto no vacío y finito sobre el conjunto de todos los elementos de enlace. Sea el paso S habilitado en una marcación M. Entonces, S puede ocurrir, cambiando la marcación M a M'. Además, decimos que la marca M es directamente alcanzable desde la marca M mediante la ocurrencia del paso S, y lo denotamos como M[S > M. Una secuencia de ocurrencias finitas es una secuencia finita de pasos y marcas: M1[S1 > M2... Mn[Sn > Mn+1 tal que n ∈ N y Mi[Si > Mi+1 ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. \n\n(Note: The original sentence seems to have a typo or missing information, as it is not complete or clear in its meaning.) El conjunto de todas las marcas posibles alcanzables para una red Net desde una marca M se llama su conjunto de alcanzabilidad, y se denota como R(Net, M). 5.1 Mapeo a Redes de Petri Coloreadas. Nuestra estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado. Lo mismo es cierto para una Red de Petri de Colores. Estamos presentando un mapeo f de uno a otro, con el fin de proporcionar semántica para la estructura normativa y demostrar propiedades sobre ella utilizando resultados teóricos bien conocidos del trabajo en CPNs. El mapeo f hace uso de correspondencias entre escenas normativas y lugares de CPN, transiciones normativas y transiciones de CPN y finalmente, entre etiquetas de arco y expresiones de arco de CPN. S → P B → T Lin ∪ Lout → E El conjunto de tipos es el conjunto unitario que contiene el color NP (es decir, Σ = {NP}). Este tipo complejo está estructurado de la siguiente manera (usamos la sintaxis CPN-ML [4]): color NPT = con Obl | Per | Prh | NoMod color IP = con informar | declarar | ofrecer color UTT = registro illp: IP ag1, rol1, ag2, rol2: cadena contenido: cadena tiempo: entero color NP = registro modo: NPT ilocución: UTT Modelar las ilocuciones como normas sin modalidad (NoMod) es un truco formal que utilizamos para asegurar que las subredes puedan combinarse como se explica a continuación. Los arcos son mapeados casi directamente. A es un conjunto finito de arcos y N es una función de nodo, tal que ∀a ∈ A ∃a ∈ Ain ∪Aout. N(a) = a. La función de inicialización I se define como I(p) = Δs (∀s ∈ S donde p se obtiene de s usando el mapeo; recuerda que s = ids, Δs). Finalmente, la función de color C asigna el color NP a cada lugar: C(p) = NP (∀p ∈ P). No estamos haciendo uso de la función de guardia G. En trabajos futuros, esta función puede ser utilizada para modelar restricciones cuando ampliemos la expresividad de nuestro lenguaje normativo. 5.2 Propiedades de Estructuras Normativas Habiendo definido la asignación de estructuras normativas a Redes de Petri de Colores, ahora examinamos propiedades de las RPC que nos ayudan a comprender la complejidad de la detección de conflictos. Una pregunta que nos gustaría responder es si, en un momento dado, una estructura normativa dada está libre de conflictos. Una instantánea de una estructura normativa corresponde a una marca en la CPN mapeada. Definición 11. Dada una marcación Mi, esta marcación es libre de conflictos si ¬∃p ∈ P. ∃np1, np2 ∈ Mi(p) tal que np1.modo = Obl y np2.modo = Prh y np1.illoc y np2.illoc unifican bajo una sustitución válida. Otra pregunta interesante sería si surgirá un conflicto a partir de tal instantánea del sistema al propagar las posiciones normativas. Para responder a esta pregunta, primero traducimos la instantánea de la estructura normativa al CPN correspondiente y luego ejecutamos la secuencia finita de ocurrencias de marcas y pasos, verificando la ausencia de conflictos en cada marca a medida que avanzamos. Definición 12. Dada una marca Mi, una secuencia finita de ocurrencias Si, Si+1, ..., Sn se llama libre de conflictos, si y solo si Mi[Si > Mi+1 . . . Mn[Sn > Mn+1 y Mk es libre de conflictos para todo k tal que i ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Sin embargo, la pregunta principal que nos gustaría investigar es si una estructura normativa dada es resistente al conflicto, es decir, si los agentes que implementan el MAS son capaces de generar conflictos a través de sus acciones. Tan pronto como se incluye la posibilidad de acciones (o enunciados) de agentes autónomos, se pierde el determinismo. Habiendo mapeado la estructura normativa a un CPN, ahora agregamos modelos de CPN de las interacciones de los agentes. Cada forma de interacción de agentes (es decir, cada actividad) puede ser modelada utilizando CPNs siguiendo la línea de Cost et al. [5]. Estas CPN no determinísticas alimentan tokens en la CPN que modela la estructura normativa. Esto conlleva a la introducción de no determinismo en la CPN combinada. La mitad inferior de la figura 3 muestra parte de un modelo CPN de un protocolo de agente donde el arco denotado con 1 representa alguna enunciación de una ilocución por un agente. La transición objetivo de este arco, no solo mueve un token al siguiente estado de esta CPN, sino que también coloca un token en el lugar correspondiente a la escena normativa apropiada en el modelo CPN de la estructura normativa (a través del arco 2). La transición 3 finalmente pudo propagar ese token en forma de obligación, por ejemplo. Por lo tanto, a partir de una marca dada, son posibles muchas secuencias de ocurrencia diferentes dependiendo de las acciones de los agentes. Hacemos uso del conjunto de alcanzabilidad R para definir una situación en la que los agentes no pueden causar conflictos. 640 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) Figura 3: Construyendo la CPN combinada Def. 13. Dado una red N, una marcación M es resistente a conflictos si y solo si todas las marcaciones en R(N,M) son libres de conflictos. Verificar la libertad de conflicto de una marca se puede hacer en tiempo polinómico al revisar todos los lugares de la CPN en busca de fichas en conflicto. La libertad de conflicto de una secuencia de ocurrencias en la CPN que representa la estructura normativa también se puede lograr en tiempo polinómico, ya que esta secuencia es determinista dado un instante. Ya sea que una estructura normativa esté diseñada de manera segura corresponde a verificar la resistencia al conflicto de la marca inicial M0. Ahora, verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una marca se convierte en una tarea muy difícil. Corresponde al problema de alcanzabilidad en una CPN: ¿se puede alcanzar un estado o lograr una marcación que contenga un conflicto? Este problema de alcanzabilidad se sabe que es NP-completo para las Redes de Petri ordinarias [22] y dado que las CPNs son funcionalmente idénticas, no podemos esperar verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una estructura normativa fuera de línea en una cantidad razonable de tiempo. Por lo tanto, se necesitan mecanismos distribuidos en tiempo de ejecución para garantizar que una estructura normativa mantenga la consistencia. Presentamos un mecanismo de este tipo en la siguiente sección. 6. Una vez que se ha detectado un conflicto (según se define en la Sección 4), proponemos emplear el unificador para resolver el conflicto. En nuestro ejemplo, si las variables en prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) no obtienen los valores especificados en la sustitución σ, entonces no habrá un conflicto. Sin embargo, en lugar de calcular el conjunto complementario de una sustitución (que puede ser un conjunto infinito), proponemos anotar la prohibición con el unificador mismo y usarlo para determinar qué variables no pueden ser en futuras unificaciones para evitar un conflicto. Por lo tanto, designamos las prohibiciones anotadas como prh(¯I) Σ, donde Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, es un conjunto de unificadores. Las normas anotadas se interpretan como construcciones deónticas con influencias limitadas, es decir, su efecto (sobre agentes, roles e ilocuciones) ha sido restringido por el conjunto Σ de unificadores. Una prohibición puede estar en conflicto con varias obligaciones en una escena normativa dada s = id, Δ y necesitamos registrar (y posiblemente evitar) todos estos conflictos. A continuación definimos un algoritmo que garantiza que una posición normativa se agregará a una escena normativa de tal manera que no cause conflictos. Aunque proponemos reducir las prohibiciones, la misma maquinaria puede utilizarse para definir la reducción de obligaciones en su lugar. Estas políticas diferentes dependen de la semántica deontológica prevista y de los requisitos de los sistemas abordados. Por ejemplo, algunas MASs pueden requerir que sus agentes no actúen en presencia de conflictos, es decir, que la obligación debe ser limitada. 6.1 Resolución de Conflictos Proponemos una forma detallada de resolver conflictos normativos a través de la unificación. Detectamos la superposición de las influencias de las normas, es decir, cómo afectan el comportamiento de los agentes involucrados, y reducimos la influencia de la posición normativa, utilizando adecuadamente las anotaciones al verificar si la norma se aplica a las ilocuciones. El algoritmo mostrado en la Figura 4 representa cómo mantenemos un conjunto de normas libre de conflictos. Agrega una norma dada N a un estado normativo Δ existente y libre de conflictos, obteniendo un nuevo estado normativo resultante Δ que es libre de conflictos, es decir, sus prohibiciones están anotadas con un conjunto de conjuntos de conflictos que indican qué asignaciones para variables deben evitarse para que no ocurran conflictos. algoritmo addNorm(N, Δ) comienza 1 marca de tiempo(N) 2 caso N de 3 per(¯I): Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 4 prh(I): si N ∈ Δ tal que conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Δ := Δ 5 de lo contrario Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 6 prh(¯I): 7 comienza 8 Σ := ∅ 9 para cada N ∈ Δ hacer 10 si conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Σ := Σ ∪ {σ} 11 Δ := Δ ∪ {N Σ} 12 fin 13 obl(¯I): 14 comienza 15 Δ1 := ∅; Δ2 := ∅ 16 para cada (N Σ) ∈ Δ hacer 17 si N = prh(I) entonces 18 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 19 de lo contrario nulo 20 de lo contrario 21 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces 22 comienza 23 Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 24 Δ2 := Δ2 ∪ {N (Σ ∪ {σ})} 25 fin 26 Δ := (Δ − Δ1) ∪ Δ2 ∪ {N} 27 fin 28 fin caso 29 devolver Δ fin Figura 4: Algoritmo para Preservar la Libertad de Conflictos El algoritmo utiliza una estructura de caso para diferenciar las diferentes posibilidades para una norma dada N. La línea 3 aborda el caso en el que la norma dada es un permiso: N simplemente se agrega a Δ. Las líneas 4-5 abordan el caso en el que intentamos agregar una prohibición de base a un estado normativo: si entra en conflicto con alguna obligación, entonces se descarta; de lo contrario, se agrega al estado normativo. Las líneas 6-12 describen la situación cuando la posición normativa a añadir es una prohibición no fundamentada. En este caso, el algoritmo inicializa Σ como un conjunto vacío y recorre en bucle (línea 9-10) las normas N en el estado normativo anterior Δ. Al encontrar uno que entre en conflicto con N, el algoritmo actualiza Σ agregando el conjunto de conflictos recién encontrado σ a él (línea 10). Al recorrer Δ en un bucle, podemos verificar cualquier conflicto entre la nueva prohibición y las obligaciones existentes, construyendo adecuadamente la anotación Σ que se utilizará al agregar N a Δ en la línea 11. Las líneas 13-27 describen cómo una nueva obligación se adapta a un estado normativo existente. Hacemos uso de dos conjuntos temporales inicialmente vacíos, Δ1, Δ2. El algoritmo recorre Δ (líneas 16-25) recogiendo aquellas prohibiciones anotadas N Σ que entran en conflicto con la nueva obligación. Sin embargo, hay dos casos con los que tratar: uno cuando un terreno La Sexta Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se encuentra la prohibición 641 (línea 17) y su excepción, que abarca prohibiciones no fundamentadas (línea 20). En ambos casos, la antigua prohibición se almacena en Δ1 (líneas 18 y 23) para ser posteriormente eliminada de Δ (línea 26). Sin embargo, en el caso de una prohibición no basada en tierra, el algoritmo actualiza su anotación de conjuntos de conflictos (línea 24). El bucle garantiza que se realice una búsqueda exhaustiva (lineal) a través de un estado normativo, verificando si la nueva obligación entra en conflicto con alguna prohibición existente, posiblemente actualizando las anotaciones de estas prohibiciones conflictivas. En la línea 26, el algoritmo construye el nuevo Δ actualizado eliminando las antiguas prohibiciones almacenadas en Δ1 y agregando las prohibiciones actualizadas almacenadas en Δ2 (si las hay), así como la nueva obligación N. Nuestro algoritmo propuesto es correcto en el sentido de que, para una posición normativa N dada y un estado normativo Δ, proporciona un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que todas las prohibiciones tienen anotaciones que registran cómo se unifican con las obligaciones existentes. Las anotaciones pueden estar vacías, sin embargo, este es el caso cuando tenemos una prohibición de base o una prohibición que no unifica/conflicta con ninguna obligación. Los permisos no afectan nuestro algoritmo y se manejan adecuadamente (línea 3). Cualquier intento de insertar una prohibición de base que entre en conflicto, produce el mismo estado normativo (línea 4). Cuando se agrega una nueva obligación, el algoritmo garantiza que se consideren todas las prohibiciones (líneas 14-27), lo que lleva a la eliminación de prohibiciones fundamentales conflictivas o la actualización de anotaciones de prohibiciones no fundamentales. El algoritmo siempre termina: los bucles están sobre un conjunto finito Δ y las verificaciones de conflictos y operaciones de conjunto siempre terminan. La complejidad del algoritmo es lineal: el conjunto Δ solo se examina una vez para cada posible caso de norma que se agregue. Al gestionar estados normativos, también puede ser necesario eliminar posiciones normativas. Esto es sencillo: los permisos se pueden eliminar sin problemas; las prohibiciones anotadas también se pueden eliminar sin más consideraciones; sin embargo, las obligaciones requieren cierto mantenimiento. Cuando una obligación debe ser eliminada, debemos verificarla con todas las prohibiciones anotadas para actualizar sus anotaciones. Aplicamos la verificación de conflictos y obtenemos un unificador, luego eliminamos este unificador de la anotación de prohibiciones. Invocamos el algoritmo de eliminación como removeNorm(N, Δ): devuelve un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que se ha eliminado N, con posibles alteraciones en otras posiciones normativas como se explica. 6.2 Promulgación de una Estructura Normativa La promulgación de una estructura normativa implica la ejecución paralela y distribuida de escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Con fines ilustrativos, a continuación describiremos la interacción entre las escenas normativas de pago y entrega y la transición normativa nt que las vincula en la mitad superior de la figura 2. Con este objetivo, considere por ejemplo que obl(inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpago y que Δentrega sostiene prh(inform(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)). Tales estados indican que el cliente Jules está obligado a pagar £400 por 350 kg de cobre al contador Rod de acuerdo con la escena normativa de pago, mientras que Rod, asumiendo el papel de gerente de almacén en esta ocasión, tiene prohibido entregar cualquier cosa al cliente Jules de acuerdo con la escena normativa de entrega. Para cada escena normativa, el proceso de promulgación es el siguiente. En primer lugar, procesa su cola de mensajes entrantes que contiene tres tipos de mensajes: enunciados de la actividad a la que está vinculado; y comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar posiciones normativas. Por ejemplo, en nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago recopila la ilocución I = utt((inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), 35)) que representa al cliente Jules pendiente de pago por cobre (a través de la flecha A en la figura 2). Las expresiones son marcadas con la hora y luego se agregan al estado normativo. Tendríamos Δpago = Δpago ∪ {I}, en nuestro ejemplo. Al recibir comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar una posición normativa, la escena normativa invoca el algoritmo de adición o eliminación correspondiente descrito en la Sección 6.1. En segundo lugar, la escena normativa reconoce su cambio de estado al enviar un mensaje de activación a cada transición normativa saliente a la que está conectada. En nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago estaría señalando su cambio de estado a la transición normativa nt. Para las transiciones normativas, el proceso funciona de manera diferente. Debido a que cada transición normativa controla la operación de una regla única, al recibir un mensaje de activación, sondea cada escena normativa entrante en busca de sustituciones para los esquemas ilocucionales relevantes en el LHS de su regla. En nuestro ejemplo, nt (siendo responsable de la regla descrita en la Sección 3.4), sondearía la escena normativa de pagos (a través de la flecha B) en busca de sustituciones. Al recibir respuestas de ellos (en forma de conjuntos de sustituciones junto con marcas de tiempo), se deben unificar las sustituciones de cada una de estas escenas normativas. Para cada unificación que encuentra, la regla se activa, y por lo tanto se envía el comando normativo correspondiente a la escena normativa de salida. La transición normativa luego lleva un registro del mensaje de activación que envió y de los sellos de tiempo de las posiciones normativas que desencadenaron la activación. Esto se hace para asegurar que las mismas posiciones normativas en el LHS de una regla solo activen su disparo una vez. En nuestro ejemplo, nt estaría recibiendo σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} de la escena normativa de pago. Dado que las sustituciones en σ unifican con la regla nts, la regla se activa y se envía el comando normativo adicionar(entrega : obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350), T)) a la escena normativa de entrega para obligar a Rod a entregar al cliente Jules 350 kg de cobre. Después de eso, la escena normativa de entrega invocaría el algoritmo addNorm de la figura 4 con Δentrega y N = obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350)) como argumentos. 7. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Y CONCLUSIONES Nuestras contribuciones en este artículo son triples. En primer lugar, presentamos un enfoque para la gestión y razonamiento sobre normas de manera distribuida. Hasta donde sabemos, hay poco trabajo publicado en esta dirección. En [8, 21], se presentan dos idiomas para la aplicación distribuida de normas en MAS. Sin embargo, en ambos trabajos, cada agente tiene una interfaz de mensajes local que reenvía mensajes legales de acuerdo con un conjunto de normas. Dado que estas interfaces son locales para cada agente, las normas solo pueden expresarse en términos de acciones de ese agente. Esta es una seria desventaja, por ejemplo, cuando se necesita activar una obligación hacia un agente debido a un mensaje de otro. La segunda contribución es la propuesta de una estructura normativa. La noción es fructífera porque permite la separación de preocupaciones normativas y procedimentales. La estructura normativa que proponemos pone de manifiesto la similitud entre la propagación de posiciones normativas y la propagación 642 de la Sexta Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) de tokens en Redes de Petri de Colores. Esa similitud sugiere fácilmente un mapeo entre ambos, y proporciona fundamentos para un tratamiento analítico conveniente de la estructura normativa, en general, y la complejidad de la detección de conflictos, en particular. La idea de modelar interacciones (en forma de conversaciones) a través de Redes de Petri ha sido investigada en [18], donde el medio de interacción y los agentes individuales son modelados como subredes de CPN que posteriormente se combinan para su análisis. En [5], las conversaciones se diseñan y analizan primero a nivel de CPNs y luego se traducen a protocolos. Lin et al. [20] mapean los esquemas de conversación a CPNs. Hasta donde sabemos, el uso de esta representación en el apoyo a la detección de conflictos en MAS regulados no ha sido reportado en otro lugar. Finalmente, presentamos un mecanismo distribuido para resolver conflictos normativos. Sartor [25] aborda los conflictos normativos desde el punto de vista de la teoría legal y sugiere una forma de ordenar las normas involucradas. Su idea se implementa en [12] pero requiere un recurso central para el mantenimiento de la norma. El enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos es una adaptación y extensión del trabajo sobre grafos de instanciación reportado en [17] y un algoritmo relacionado en [27]. El algoritmo presentado en el artículo actual se puede utilizar para gestionar estados normativos de forma distribuida: escenas normativas que ocurren en paralelo tienen un estado normativo asociado Δ al cual el algoritmo se aplica de forma independiente cada vez que se introduce una nueva norma. Estas tres contribuciones que presentamos en este artículo abren muchas posibilidades para trabajos futuros. Deberíamos mencionar primero que, como estrategia general, estamos trabajando en una generalización de la noción de estructura normativa para hacerla operar con diferentes modelos de coordinación, con un contenido deóntico más rico y sobre diferentes realizaciones computacionales de MAS regulados. Como primer paso en esta dirección, estamos aprovechando el desacoplamiento entre los protocolos de interacción y la orientación normativa declarativa que la estructura normativa pone a disposición, para proporcionar una capa normativa para las <br>instituciones electrónicas</br> (como se define en [1]). Esperamos que dicho acoplamiento dote a las <br>instituciones electrónicas</br> de un entorno normativo más flexible y expresivo. Además, queremos ampliar nuestro modelo en varias direcciones: (1) para manejar la negación y restricciones como parte del lenguaje normativo, y en particular la noción de tiempo; (2) para acomodar múltiples autoridades normativas jerárquicas basadas en roles, siguiendo las líneas de Cholvy y Cuppens [3] y las relaciones de poder sugeridas por Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) para capturar en el algoritmo de resolución de conflictos diferentes semánticas relacionadas con las nociones deónticas mediante el apoyo a diferentes axiomatizaciones (por ejemplo, la fuerza relativa de la prohibición versus la obligación, nociones deónticas por defecto, inconsistencias deónticas). En el lado teórico, pretendemos utilizar técnicas de análisis de CPNs para caracterizar clases de CPNs (por ejemplo, acíclicos, simétricos, etc.) correspondientes a familias de Estructuras Normativas que son susceptibles a la detección de conflictos offline manejables. La combinación de estas técnicas junto con nuestros mecanismos en línea de resolución de conflictos tiene como objetivo dotar a los diseñadores de MAS con la capacidad de incorporar normas en sus sistemas de manera fundamentada.

                "The intuitive meaning of p(ag, r, ag , r , m, t) is that agent ag playing role r sent message m to agent ag playing role r at time t. An example of an illocution is inform(ag4, supp, ag3, client, offer(wire, 12), 10).",
                "Sometimes it is useful to refer to illocutions that are not fully grounded, that is, those that may contain uninstantiated (free) variables.",
                "In the description of a protocol, for instance, the precise values of the message exchanged can be left unspecified.",
                "During the enactment of the protocol agents will produce the actual values which will give rise to a ground illocution.",

                "The loop guarantees that an exhaustive (linear) search through a normative state takes place, checking if the new obligation is in conflict with any existing prohibitions, possibly updating the annotations of these conflicting prohibitions.",
                "In line 26 the algorithm builds the new updated Δ by removing the old prohibitions stored in Δ1 and adding the updated prohibitions stored in Δ2 (if any), as well as the new obligation N. Our proposed algorithm is correct in that, for a given normative position N and a normative state Δ, it provides a new normative state Δ in which all prohibitions have annotations recording how they unify with existing obligations.",

                "When managing normative states we may also need to remove normative positions.",

                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",

                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",

                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) of tokens in Coloured Petri Nets.",
                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different coordination models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",
                "The combination of these techniques along with our online conflict resolution mechanisms is intended to endow MAS designers with the ability to incorporate norms into their systems in a principled way. 8.",

                "For illustrative purposes, hereafter we shall describe the interplay between the payment and delivery normative scenes and the normative transition nt linking them in the upper half of figure 2.",
                "With this aim, consider for instance that obl(inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpayment and that Δdelivery holds prh(inform(rod,wm, jules, client, delivered(Z, Q), T)).",
                "Such states indicate that client Jules is obliged to pay £400 for 350kg of copper to accountant Rod according to the payment normative scene, whereas Rod, taking up the role of warehouse manager this time, is prohibited to deliver anything to client Jules according to the delivery normative scene.",
                "For each normative scene, the enactment process goes as follows.",
                "Firstly, it processes its incoming message queue that contains three types of messages: utterances from the activity it is linked to; and normative commands either to add or remove normative positions.",
                "For instance, in our example, the payment normative scene collects the illocution I = utt((inform(jules, client, rod, acc, pay(copper, 400, 350), 35)) standing for client Jules pending payment for copper (via arrow A in figure 2).",
                "Utterances are timestamped and subsequently added to the normative state.",
                "We would have Δpayment = Δpayment ∪ {I}, in our example.",
                "Upon receiving normative commands to either add or remove a normative position, the normative scene invokes the corresponding addition or removal algorithm described in Section 6.1.",
                "Secondly, the normative scene acknowledges its state change by sending a trigger message to every outgoing normative transition it is connected to.",
                "In our example, the payment normative scene would be signalling its state change to normative transition nt.",
                "For normative transitions, the process works differently.",
                "Because each normative transition controls the operation of a single rule, upon receiving a trigger message, it polls every incoming normative scene for substitutions for the relevant illocution schemata on the LHS of its rule.",
                "In our example, nt (being responsible for the rule described in Section 3.4), would poll the payment normative scene (via arrow B) for substitutions.",
                "Upon receiving replies from them (in the form of sets of substitutions together with time-stamps), it has to unify substitutions from each of these normative scenes.",
                "For each unification it finds, the rule is fired, and hence the corresponding normative command is sent along to the output normative scene.",
                "The normative transition then keeps track of the firing message it sent on and of the time-stamps of the normative positions that triggered the firing.",
                "This is done to ensure that the very same normative positions in the LHS of a rule only trigger its firing once.",
                "In our example, nt would be receiving σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} from the payment normative scene.",
                "Since the substitions in σ unify with nts rule, the rule is fired, and the normative command add(delivery : obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350), T)) is sent along to the delivery normative scene to oblige Rod to deliver to client Jules 350kg of copper.",
                "After that, the delivery normative scene would invoke the addNorm algorithm from figure 4 with Δdelivery and N = obl(rod, wm, jules, client, delivered(copper, 350)) as arguments. 7.",
                "RELATED WORK AND CONCLUSIONS Our contributions in this paper are three-fold.",
                "Firstly, we introduce an approach for the management of and reasoning about norms in a distributed manner.",
                "To our knowledge, there is little work published in this direction.",
                "In [8, 21], two languages are presented for the distributed enforcement of norms in MAS.",
                "However, in both works, each agent has a local message interface that forwards legal messages according to a set of norms.",
                "Since these interfaces are local to each agent, norms can only be expressed in terms of actions of that agent.",
                "This is a serious disadvantage, e.g. when one needs to activate an obligation to one agent due to a certain message of another one.",
                "The second contribution is the proposal of a normative structure.",
                "The notion is fruitful because it allows the separation of normative and procedural concerns.",

                "That similarity readily suggests a mapping between the two, and gives grounds to a convenient analytical treatment of the normative structure, in general, and the complexity of conflict detection, in particular.",
                "The idea of modelling interactions (in the form of conversations) via Petri Nets has been investigated in [18], where the interaction medium and individual agents are modelled as CPN sub-nets that are subsequently combined for analysis.",
                "In [5], conversations are first designed and analysed at the level of CPNs and thereafter translated into protocols.",
                "Lin et al. [20] map conversation schemata to CPNs.",
                "To our knowledge, the use of this representation in the support of conflict detection in regulated MAS has not been reported elsewhere.",
                "Finally, we present a distributed mechanism to resolve normative conflicts.",
                "Sartor [25] treats normative conflicts from the point of view of legal theory and suggests a way to order the norms involved.",
                "His idea is implemented in [12] but requires a central resource for norm maintenance.",
                "The approach to conflict detection and resolution is an adaptation and extension of the work on instantiation graphs reported in [17] and a related algorithm in [27].",
                "The algorithm presented in the current paper can be used to manage normative states distributedly: normative scenes that happen in parallel have an associated normative state Δ to which the algorithm is independently applied each time a new norm is to be introduced.",
                "These three contributions we present in this paper open many possibilities for future work.",
                "We should mention first, that as a broad strategy we are working on a generalisation of the notion of normative structure to make it operate with different <br>coordination</br> models, with richer deontic content and on top of different computational realisations of regulated MAS.",
                "As a first step in this direction we are taking advantage of the de-coupling between interaction protocols and declarative normative guidance that the normative structure makes available, to provide a normative layer for electronic institutions (as defined in [1]).",
                "We expect such coupling will endow electronic institutions with a more flexible -and more expressive- normative environment.",
                "Furthermore, we want to extend our model along several directions: (1) to handle negation and constraints as part of the norm language, and in particular the notion of time; (2) to accommodate multiple, hierarchical norm authorities based on roles, along the lines of Cholvy and Cuppens [3] and power relationships as suggested by Carabelea et al. [2]; (3) to capture in the conflict resolution algorithm different semantics relating the deontic notions by supporting different axiomations (e.g., relative strength of prohibition versus obligation, default deontic notions, deontic inconsistencies).",
                "On the theoretical side, we intend to use analysis techniques of CPNs in order to characterise classes of CPNs (e.g., acyclic, symmetric, etc.) corresponding to families of Normative Structures that are susceptible to tractable offline conflict detection.",

La gestión distribuida de normas es un tema desafiante y observamos una falta de realizaciones computacionales verdaderamente distribuidas de modelos normativos. Para regular el comportamiento de agentes autónomos que participan en múltiples actividades relacionadas, proponemos un modelo normativo, la Estructura Normativa (EN), un artefacto basado en la propagación de posiciones normativas (obligaciones, prohibiciones, permisos), como consecuencias de las acciones de los agentes. Dentro de un SN, los conflictos pueden surgir debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Mostramos esto formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri de Colores y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos de ese campo. Dado que se requiere la resolución de conflictos en línea, presentamos un algoritmo manejable que se empleará de forma distribuida. Luego demostramos que este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de una NS. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Lenguajes y estructuras Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. Una característica fundamental de los sistemas multiagentes abiertos y regulados en los que interactúan agentes autónomos es que los agentes participantes deben cumplir con las convenciones del sistema. Las normas pueden ser utilizadas para modelar tales convenciones y, por lo tanto, como un medio para regular el comportamiento observable de los agentes [6, 29]. Hay muchas contribuciones sobre el tema de las normas de sociólogos, filósofos y lógicos (por ejemplo, [15, 28]). Sin embargo, hay muy pocas propuestas de realizaciones computacionales de modelos normativos, es decir, la forma en que las normas pueden integrarse en el diseño y la ejecución de los Sistemas Multiagentes. Los pocos que existen (por ejemplo, [10, 13, 24]), operan de manera centralizada, lo que crea cuellos de botella y puntos únicos de fallo. Hasta donde sabemos, ninguna propuesta realmente respalda la ejecución distribuida de entornos normativos. En nuestro artículo abordamos ese problema y proponemos medios para manejar compromisos conflictivos en sistemas multiagentes abiertos, regulados, de manera distribuida. El tipo de MAS regulado que imaginamos consiste en múltiples actividades concurrentes y relacionadas en las que interactúan agentes. Cada agente puede participar simultáneamente en varias actividades y cambiar de una actividad a otra. Las acciones de un agente dentro de una actividad pueden tener consecuencias en forma de posiciones normativas (es decir, obligaciones, permisos y prohibiciones) [26] que pueden limitar su comportamiento futuro. Por ejemplo, un agente comprador que se quede sin crédito puede ser prohibido de hacer más ofertas, o un agente vendedor está obligado a entregar después de cerrar un trato. Suponemos que los agentes pueden optar por no cumplir con todas sus obligaciones y, por lo tanto, pueden ser sancionados por la MAS. Ten en cuenta que, cuando las actividades están distribuidas, las posiciones normativas deben fluir desde las actividades en las que se generan hacia aquellas en las que tienen efecto. Por ejemplo, la obligación del vendedor mencionada anteriormente debe fluir (o propagarse) desde una actividad de negociación hasta una actividad de entrega. Dado que en un MAS abierto y regulado no se pueden incorporar aspectos normativos en el diseño de los agentes, adoptamos la perspectiva de que el MAS debería complementarse con un conjunto separado de normas que regulen aún más el comportamiento de los agentes participantes. Para modelar la separación de preocupaciones entre el <br>nivel de coordinación</br> (interacciones de agentes) y el nivel normativo (propagación de posiciones normativas), proponemos un artefacto llamado Estructura Normativa (EN). Dentro de un sistema multiagente pueden surgir conflictos debido a la naturaleza dinámica del MAS y la concurrencia de las acciones de los agentes. Por ejemplo, un agente puede estar obligado y prohibido de realizar la misma acción en una actividad. Dado que la regulación de un MAS implica que los agentes participantes deben ser conscientes de la validez de las acciones que tienen lugar dentro de él, dichos conflictos deben ser identificados y posiblemente resueltos si se requiere una afirmación de validez para que un agente participe en una acción o sea sancionado. Sin embargo, garantizar la libertad de conflicto de un NS en el momento del diseño es computacionalmente intratable. Lo demostramos formalizando la noción de conflicto, proporcionando un mapeo de NSs en Redes de Petri Coloreadas (CPNs) y tomando prestados resultados teóricos bien conocidos del campo de las CPNs. Creemos que es necesario la detección y resolución de conflictos en línea. Por lo tanto, presentamos un algoritmo manejable para la resolución de conflictos. Este algoritmo es fundamental para la ejecución distribuida de un NS. El documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2 detallamos un escenario que servirá como ejemplo a lo largo del documento. A continuación, en la Sección 3 definimos formalmente el artefacto de estructura normativa. Más adelante, en la Sección 4 formalizamos la noción de conflicto para posteriormente analizar la complejidad de la detección de conflictos en términos de CPNs en la Sección 5. La sección 6 describe la gestión computacional de las NSs al describir su puesta en práctica y presentar un algoritmo para la resolución de conflictos. Finalmente, comentamos sobre el trabajo relacionado, sacamos conclusiones e informamos sobre el trabajo futuro en la Sección 7.2. ESCENARIO Utilizamos un escenario de cadena de suministro en el que empresas e individuos se reúnen en un mercado en línea para realizar negocios. El procedimiento general de la transacción puede organizarse en seis actividades distribuidas, representadas como nodos en el diagrama de la Figura 1. Involucran a diferentes participantes cuyo comportamiento está coordinado a través de protocolos. En este escenario, los agentes pueden desempeñar uno de cuatro roles: contador de mercado (acc), cliente, proveedor (supp) y gerentes de almacén (wm). Las flechas que conectan las actividades representan cómo los agentes pueden moverse de una actividad a otra. Después de registrarse en el mercado, los clientes y proveedores se reúnen en una actividad donde negocian los términos de su transacción, es decir, precios, cantidades de productos a entregar, plazos y otros detalles. En la actividad contractual, se establece el pedido y se prepara una factura. El cliente participará luego en una actividad de pago, verificando su solvencia crediticia e instruyendo a su banco para transferir la cantidad correcta de dinero. El proveedor, mientras tanto, se encargará de que los bienes sean entregados (por ejemplo, a través de un gerente de almacén) en la actividad de entrega. Finalmente, los agentes pueden abandonar el mercado siguiendo un protocolo de salida predeterminado. El contador del mercado participa en la mayoría de las actividades como un proveedor de confianza de herramientas de auditoría. En el resto del documento construiremos sobre este escenario para ejemplificar la noción de estructura normativa e ilustrar nuestro enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos en un entorno distribuido. 3. ESTRUCTURA NORMATIVA En los MASs, los agentes interactúan de acuerdo con protocolos que naturalmente están distribuidos. Abogamos porque las acciones en un protocolo de este tipo pueden tener un efecto en la implementación de otros protocolos. Ciertas acciones pueden volverse prohibidas u obligatorias, por ejemplo. Tomamos las posiciones normativas como obligaciones, prohibiciones y permisos similares al trabajo descrito en [26]. La intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa la llamamos comando normativo. Las apariciones de posiciones normativas en un protocolo pueden tener consecuencias para otros protocolos. Para definir nuestro lenguaje normativo y especificar cómo se propagan las posiciones normativas, nos hemos inspirado en los sistemas de múltiples contextos [14]. Estos sistemas permiten la estructuración del conocimiento en teorías formales distintas y la definición de relaciones entre ellas. Las relaciones se expresan como reglas de puente: la deducibilidad de fórmulas en algunos contextos conduce a la deducción de otras fórmulas en otros contextos. Recientemente, estos sistemas han sido utilizados con éxito para definir arquitecturas de agentes [11, 23]. La metáfora se traduce a nuestro trabajo actual de la siguiente manera: la emisión de ilocuciones y/o la existencia de posiciones normativas en algunas escenas normativas conduce a la deducción de posiciones normativas en otras escenas normativas. Nos preocupamos por la propagación y distribución de posiciones normativas dentro de una red de escenas normativas distribuidas como consecuencia de las acciones de los agentes. Tomamos escenas normativas como conjuntos de posiciones normativas y enunciados que están asociados con un protocolo de interacción subyacente correspondiente a una actividad. En esta sección, primero presentamos un lenguaje simple que captura estos aspectos e introducimos formalmente las nociones de escena normativa, regla de transición normativa y estructura normativa. Damos la semántica prevista de estas reglas y mostramos cómo controlar un MAS a través de normas en un ejemplo. 3.1 Conceptos Básicos Los bloques de construcción de nuestro lenguaje son términos y fórmulas atómicas: Def. 1. Un término, denotado como t, es (i) cualquier constante expresada en minúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, a, b0, c o (ii) cualquier variable expresada en mayúsculas (con o sin subíndices), por ejemplo, X, Y, Zb o (iii) cualquier función f(t1, . . . , tn), donde f es un símbolo de función n-ario y t1, .., tn son términos. Algunos ejemplos de términos y funciones son Crédito, precio u oferta (biblia, 30) siendo respectivamente una variable, una constante y una función. Estaremos utilizando identificadores a lo largo del documento, los cuales son términos constantes y también necesitan la siguiente definición: Def. 2. Una fórmula atómica es cualquier construcción p(t1, . . . , tn), donde p es un símbolo de predicado n-ario y t1, . . . , tn son términos. El conjunto de todas las fórmulas atómicas se denota como Δ. Nos enfocamos en una clase expresiva de MASs en la que la interacción se lleva a cabo mediante actos de habla ilocucionarios intercambiados entre agentes participantes: Def. 3. Las ilocuciones I son fórmulas atómicas fundamentales que tienen la forma p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) donde p es un elemento de 1. Aquí, abstraemos de los protocolos y nos referimos a ellos genéricamente como actividades. El Sexto Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 637 un conjunto de partículas ilocucionarias (por ejemplo, informar, solicitar, ofrecer); ag, ag son identificadores de agentes; r, r son identificadores de roles; δ, un término de base arbitrario, es el contenido del mensaje, construido a partir de un lenguaje de contenido compartido; t ∈ N es una marca de tiempo. El significado intuitivo de p(ag, r, ag, r, m, t) es que el agente ag desempeñando el rol r envió el mensaje m al agente ag desempeñando el rol r en el tiempo t. Un ejemplo de una ilocución es informar(ag4, supp, ag3, cliente, oferta(wire, 12), 10). A veces es útil hacer referencia a las ilocuciones que no están completamente fundamentadas, es decir, aquellas que pueden contener variables no instanciadas (libres). En la descripción de un protocolo, por ejemplo, los valores precisos de los mensajes intercambiados pueden quedar sin especificar. Durante la promulgación del protocolo, los agentes producirán los valores reales que darán lugar a una ilocución de base. Por lo tanto, podemos definir los esquemas ilocutivos: Def. 4. Un esquema ilocutivo ¯I es cualquier fórmula atómica p(ag, r, ag, r, δ, t) en la que algunos de los términos pueden ser variables o pueden contener variables. 3.2 Definición formal de la noción de NS. Primero definimos las escenas normativas de la siguiente manera: Def. 5. Una escena normativa es una tupla s = ids, Δs donde ids es un identificador de escena y Δs es el conjunto de fórmulas atómicas δ (es decir, enunciados y posiciones normativas) que se cumplen en s. También nos referiremos a Δs como el estado de la escena normativa s. Por ejemplo, una instantánea del estado de la escena normativa de entrega de nuestro escenario podría representarse como: Δs = 8 < : utt(solicitud(sean, cliente, kev, wm, recibir(cable, 200), 20)), utt(aceptar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, recibir(cable, 200), 30)), obl(informar(kev, wm, sean, cliente, entregado(cable, 200), 30)) 9 = ; Es decir, el agente Sean asumiendo el rol de cliente ha solicitado al agente Kev (asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) recibir 200 kg de cable, y Kev está obligado a entregar 200 kg de cable a Sean ya que aceptó la solicitud. Ten en cuenta que el estado de una escena normativa Δs evoluciona con el tiempo. Estas escenas normativas están conectadas entre sí a través de transiciones normativas que especifican cómo las enunciaciones y posiciones normativas en una escena afectan a otras escenas normativas. Como se mencionó anteriormente, las actividades no son independientes ya que las ilocuciones pronunciadas en algunas de ellas pueden tener un efecto en las demás. Las reglas de transición normativas definen las condiciones bajo las cuales se genera un mandato normativo. Estas condiciones son ya sea enunciados o posiciones normativas asociadas con un protocolo dado (denotado por ejemplo actividad: enunciado) que generan un mandato normativo, es decir, la adición o eliminación de otra posición normativa, posiblemente relacionada con una actividad diferente. Nuestras reglas de transición están definidas de la siguiente manera: Def. 6. Una regla de transición normativa R tiene la forma: R ::= V C V ::= ids : D | V, V D ::= N | utt(¯I) N ::= per(¯I) | prh(¯I) | obl(¯I) C ::= add(ids : N) | remove(ids : N) donde ¯I es un esquema de ilocución, N es una posición normativa (es decir, permiso, prohibición u obligación), ids es un identificador para la actividad s y C es un comando normativo. Dotamos a nuestro lenguaje con la semántica habitual de los lenguajes basados en reglas [19]. Las reglas mapean una estructura normativa existente a una nueva estructura normativa donde solo cambia el estado de las escenas normativas. En las definiciones a continuación nos basamos en el concepto estándar de sustitución [9]. Definición 7. Una transición normativa es una tupla b = idb, rb donde idb es un identificador y rb es una regla de transición normativa. Estamos proponiendo extender la noción de MAS, regulada por protocolos, con una capa adicional que consiste en escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Esta capa se representa como un grafo bipartito al que llamamos estructura normativa. Una estructura normativa relaciona escenas normativas y transiciones normativas especificando qué posiciones normativas deben generarse o eliminarse en qué escenas normativas. Definición 8. Una estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado NS = Nodos, Bordes, Lin, Lout. Nodos es un conjunto S∪B donde S es un conjunto de escenas normativas y B es un conjunto de transiciones normativas. Los bordes es un conjunto Ain ∪ Aout donde Ain ⊆ S × B es un conjunto de arcos de entrada etiquetados con una fórmula atómica utilizando la función de etiquetado Lin : Ain → D; y Aout ⊆ B × S es un conjunto de arcos de salida etiquetados con una posición normativa utilizando la función de etiquetado Lout : Aout → N. Lo siguiente debe cumplirse: 1. Cada fórmula atómica que aparece en el LHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma (ids : D) donde s ∈ S y D ∈ Δ y ∃ain ∈ Ain tal que ain = (s, b) y Lin (ain) = D. 2. La fórmula atómica que aparece en el RHS de una regla rb debe tener la forma add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) donde s ∈ S y ∃aout ∈ Aout tal que aout = (b, s) y Lout(aout) = N. 3. ∀a ∈ Ain tal que a = (s, b) y b = idb, rb y Lin(a) = D entonces (ids:D) debe ocurrir en el LHS de rb. 4. ∀a ∈ Aout tal que a = (b, s) y b = idb, rb y Lout(a) = N entonces add(ids: N) o remove(ids: N) debe ocurrir en el RHS de rb. Los dos primeros puntos aseguran que cada fórmula atómica en el LHS de una regla de transición normativa etiqueta un arco que entra en la transición normativa apropiada en la estructura normativa, y que la fórmula atómica en el RHS etiqueta el arco saliente correspondiente. Los puntos tres y cuatro aseguran que las etiquetas de todos los arcos entrantes se utilicen en el LHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos entran, y que las etiquetas de todos los arcos salientes se utilicen en el RHS de la regla de transición normativa en la que estos arcos salen. 3.3 Semántica prevista La semántica formal se definirá mediante un mapeo a Redes de Petri de Colores en la Sección 5.1. Aquí comenzamos a definir la semántica prevista de las reglas de transición normativas describiendo cómo una regla cambia una escena normativa de una estructura normativa existente, dando como resultado una nueva estructura normativa. Cada regla se activa una vez por cada sustitución que unifica el lado izquierdo V de la regla con el estado de las escenas normativas correspondientes. Una fórmula atómica (es decir, una enunciación o una posición normativa) se cumple si es unificable con una enunciación o posición normativa que pertenece al estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Cada vez que se activa una regla, se lleva a cabo el comando normativo especificado en el lado derecho de esa regla, con la intención de agregar o eliminar una posición normativa del estado de la escena normativa correspondiente. Sin embargo, la adición no es incondicional ya que pueden surgir conflictos. Este tema será tratado en las Secciones 4 y 6.1. 638 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. En nuestro ejemplo en curso tenemos la siguiente regla de transición normativa ejemplar: \"pago: obl(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)), pago: utt(informar(X, cliente, Y, cuenta, pagar(Z, P, Q), T)) « entrega: add(obl(informar(Y, wm, X, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)))\". Es decir, durante la actividad de pago, una obligación en el cliente X de informar al contador Y sobre el pago P del artículo Z en el tiempo T y la correspondiente declaración que cumple con esta obligación permite el flujo de una norma hacia la actividad de entrega. La norma es una obligación para el agente Y (en este caso asumiendo el rol de gerente de almacén wm) de enviar un mensaje al cliente X informando que el artículo Z ha sido entregado. Mostramos en la Figura 2 una representación diagramática de cómo se relacionan las actividades y una estructura normativa: Nivel Normativo Contrato de Entrega de Pago Salida Registro Pago Entrega Negociación Nivel de Coordinación Contrato nt Figura 2: Actividades y Estructura Normativa A medida que se emiten enunciados ilocucionarios durante las actividades, surgen posiciones normativas. Las expresiones y posiciones normativas se combinan en reglas de transición, causando el flujo de posiciones normativas entre escenas normativas. La conexión entre los dos niveles se describe en la Sección 6.2.4. DEFINICIÓN DE CONFLICTO Los términos conflicto deóntico e inconsistencia deóntica se han utilizado indistintamente en la literatura. Sin embargo, en este documento adoptamos la perspectiva de [7] en la que los autores sugieren que surge una inconsistencia deontológica cuando una acción es simultáneamente permitida y prohibida, ya que una permisión puede no ser llevada a cabo, por lo que no se produce un conflicto real. Las situaciones en las que una acción está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida son, sin embargo, conflictos deontológicos, ya que tanto las obligaciones como las prohibiciones influyen en los comportamientos de manera conflictiva. El contenido de las posiciones normativas en este documento son actos ilocutivos. Por lo tanto, surge un conflicto normativo cuando una ilocución está simultáneamente obligada y prohibida. Proponemos utilizar la noción estándar de unificación [9] para detectar cuándo se superponen una prohibición y un permiso. Por ejemplo, una obligación obl(inform(A1, R1, A2, R2, p(c, X), T)) y una prohibición prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T)) están en conflicto ya que se unifican bajo σ = {A1/a1, R1/r1, A2/a2, R2/r2, Y/c, X/d, T/T}. Capturamos formalmente esta noción: Def. 9. Un conflicto (deóntico) surge entre dos posiciones normativas N y N bajo una sustitución σ, denotado como conflict(N, N, σ), si y solo si N = prh(¯I), N = obl(¯I) y unificar(¯I, ¯I, σ). Es decir, una prohibición y una obligación están en conflicto si, y solo si, sus ilocuciones se unifican bajo σ. La sustitución σ, llamada aquí el conjunto de conflictos, unifica a los agentes, roles y fórmulas atómicas. Suponemos que unificar es una implementación adecuada de un algoritmo de unificación que i) siempre termina (posiblemente fallando, si no se puede encontrar un unificador); ii) es correcto; y iii) tiene complejidad computacional lineal. Las inconsistencias causadas por la misma ilocución siendo simultáneamente permitida y prohibida pueden ser formalizadas de manera similar. En este artículo nos enfocamos en conflictos de prohibición/obligación, pero la maquinaria computacional introducida en la Sección 6.1 también puede ser utilizada para detectar inconsistencias de prohibición/permiso, si sustituimos la modalidad obl por per. 5. FORMALIZANDO LA LIBERTAD DE CONFLICTOS En esta sección introducimos algunos conocimientos previos sobre las CPN asumiendo una comprensión básica de las Redes de Petri ordinarias. Para detalles técnicos remitimos al lector a [16]. Luego mapeamos los NSs a los CPNs y analizamos sus propiedades. Las CPNs combinan la potencia de las redes de Petri con la potencia de los lenguajes de programación funcional. Por un lado, las redes de Petri proporcionan los elementos básicos para la descripción de la sincronización de procesos concurrentes. Como se observó en [16], las CPNs tienen una semántica que se basa en la concurrencia verdadera en lugar de la interlección. En nuestra opinión, una semántica de verdadera concurrencia es más fácil de trabajar porque es la forma en que imaginamos que debe ser la conexión entre el <br>nivel de coordinación</br> y el nivel normativo de un sistema multiagente. Por otro lado, los lenguajes de programación funcional utilizados por las CPNs proporcionan los elementos básicos para la definición de tipos de datos y la manipulación de sus valores de datos. Por lo tanto, podemos traducir fácilmente expresiones de una estructura normativa. Por último, pero no menos importante, las CPN tienen una semántica bien definida que define de manera inequívoca el comportamiento de cada CPN. Además, las CPNs cuentan con una gran cantidad de métodos y herramientas de análisis formales mediante los cuales se pueden demostrar propiedades de las CPNs. En resumen, las CPNs nos proporcionan todas las características necesarias para razonar formalmente sobre estructuras normativas siempre que se proporcione un mapeo adecuado. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri, los estados de una CPN se representan mediante lugares. Pero a diferencia de las Redes de Petri, cada lugar tiene un tipo de dato asociado que determina el tipo de datos que el lugar puede contener. Un estado de una CPN se llama marcado. Consiste en una serie de fichas colocadas en los lugares individuales. Cada token lleva consigo un valor de datos que tiene el tipo del lugar correspondiente. En general, un lugar puede contener dos o más fichas con el mismo valor de datos. Por lo tanto, una marca de una CPN es una función que asigna a cada plaza un multiconjunto de fichas del tipo correcto. Uno a menudo se refiere a los valores de los tokens como colores de tokens y también se refiere a los tipos de datos como conjuntos de colores. Los tipos de una CPN pueden ser arbitrariamente complejos. Las acciones en una CPN se representan mediante transiciones. Un arco entrante en una transición desde un lugar indica que la transición puede eliminar fichas del lugar correspondiente, mientras que un arco saliente indica que la transición puede agregar fichas. El número exacto de tokens y sus valores de datos son determinados por las expresiones de arco, las cuales están codificadas utilizando el lenguaje de programación elegido para la CPN. Una transición está habilitada en una CPN si y solo si el multi-conjunto (o bolsa) 2 A es una extensión de la noción de conjunto, permitiendo la posibilidad de múltiples apariciones del mismo elemento. El Sexto Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), 639 variables en las expresiones de sus arcos entrantes están vinculadas a algún valor (cada uno de estos vínculos se denomina elemento de vinculación). Si es así, la transición puede ocurrir al eliminar fichas de sus lugares de entrada y agregar fichas a sus lugares de salida. Además de las expresiones de arco, es posible adjuntar una expresión de guardia booleana (con variables) a cada transición. Al juntar todos los elementos anteriores, obtenemos una definición formal de CPN que se empleará más adelante con fines de mapeo. Definición 10. Un CPN es una tupla Σ, P, T, A, N, C, G, E, I donde: (i) Σ es un conjunto finito de tipos no vacíos, también llamados conjuntos de colores; (ii) P es un conjunto finito de lugares; (iii) T es un conjunto finito de transiciones; (iv) A es un conjunto finito de arcos; (v) N es una función de nodo definida de A en P × T ∪ T × P; (vi) C es una función de color de P en Σ; (vii) G es una función de guarda de T en expresiones; (viii) E es una función de expresión de arco de A en expresiones; (ix) I es una función de inicialización de P en expresiones cerradas; Nótese que la explicación informal de las reglas de habilitación y ocurrencia proporcionadas anteriormente sienta las bases para comprender el comportamiento de un CPN. De acuerdo con las redes de Petri ordinarias, el comportamiento concurrente de una CPN se basa en la noción de paso. Formalmente, un paso es un multi-conjunto no vacío y finito sobre el conjunto de todos los elementos de enlace. Sea el paso S habilitado en una marcación M. Entonces, S puede ocurrir, cambiando la marcación M a M'. Además, decimos que la marca M es directamente alcanzable desde la marca M mediante la ocurrencia del paso S, y lo denotamos como M[S > M. Una secuencia de ocurrencias finitas es una secuencia finita de pasos y marcas: M1[S1 > M2... Mn[Sn > Mn+1 tal que n ∈ N y Mi[Si > Mi+1 ∀i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. \n\n(Note: The original sentence seems to have a typo or missing information, as it is not complete or clear in its meaning.) El conjunto de todas las marcas posibles alcanzables para una red Net desde una marca M se llama su conjunto de alcanzabilidad, y se denota como R(Net, M). 5.1 Mapeo a Redes de Petri Coloreadas. Nuestra estructura normativa es un grafo bipartito etiquetado. Lo mismo es cierto para una Red de Petri de Colores. Estamos presentando un mapeo f de uno a otro, con el fin de proporcionar semántica para la estructura normativa y demostrar propiedades sobre ella utilizando resultados teóricos bien conocidos del trabajo en CPNs. El mapeo f hace uso de correspondencias entre escenas normativas y lugares de CPN, transiciones normativas y transiciones de CPN y finalmente, entre etiquetas de arco y expresiones de arco de CPN. S → P B → T Lin ∪ Lout → E El conjunto de tipos es el conjunto unitario que contiene el color NP (es decir, Σ = {NP}). Este tipo complejo está estructurado de la siguiente manera (usamos la sintaxis CPN-ML [4]): color NPT = con Obl | Per | Prh | NoMod color IP = con informar | declarar | ofrecer color UTT = registro illp: IP ag1, rol1, ag2, rol2: cadena contenido: cadena tiempo: entero color NP = registro modo: NPT ilocución: UTT Modelar las ilocuciones como normas sin modalidad (NoMod) es un truco formal que utilizamos para asegurar que las subredes puedan combinarse como se explica a continuación. Los arcos son mapeados casi directamente. A es un conjunto finito de arcos y N es una función de nodo, tal que ∀a ∈ A ∃a ∈ Ain ∪Aout. N(a) = a. La función de inicialización I se define como I(p) = Δs (∀s ∈ S donde p se obtiene de s usando el mapeo; recuerda que s = ids, Δs). Finalmente, la función de color C asigna el color NP a cada lugar: C(p) = NP (∀p ∈ P). No estamos haciendo uso de la función de guardia G. En trabajos futuros, esta función puede ser utilizada para modelar restricciones cuando ampliemos la expresividad de nuestro lenguaje normativo. 5.2 Propiedades de Estructuras Normativas Habiendo definido la asignación de estructuras normativas a Redes de Petri de Colores, ahora examinamos propiedades de las RPC que nos ayudan a comprender la complejidad de la detección de conflictos. Una pregunta que nos gustaría responder es si, en un momento dado, una estructura normativa dada está libre de conflictos. Una instantánea de una estructura normativa corresponde a una marca en la CPN mapeada. Definición 11. Dada una marcación Mi, esta marcación es libre de conflictos si ¬∃p ∈ P. ∃np1, np2 ∈ Mi(p) tal que np1.modo = Obl y np2.modo = Prh y np1.illoc y np2.illoc unifican bajo una sustitución válida. Otra pregunta interesante sería si surgirá un conflicto a partir de tal instantánea del sistema al propagar las posiciones normativas. Para responder a esta pregunta, primero traducimos la instantánea de la estructura normativa al CPN correspondiente y luego ejecutamos la secuencia finita de ocurrencias de marcas y pasos, verificando la ausencia de conflictos en cada marca a medida que avanzamos. Definición 12. Dada una marca Mi, una secuencia finita de ocurrencias Si, Si+1, ..., Sn se llama libre de conflictos, si y solo si Mi[Si > Mi+1 . . . Mn[Sn > Mn+1 y Mk es libre de conflictos para todo k tal que i ≤ k ≤ n + 1. Sin embargo, la pregunta principal que nos gustaría investigar es si una estructura normativa dada es resistente al conflicto, es decir, si los agentes que implementan el MAS son capaces de generar conflictos a través de sus acciones. Tan pronto como se incluye la posibilidad de acciones (o enunciados) de agentes autónomos, se pierde el determinismo. Habiendo mapeado la estructura normativa a un CPN, ahora agregamos modelos de CPN de las interacciones de los agentes. Cada forma de interacción de agentes (es decir, cada actividad) puede ser modelada utilizando CPNs siguiendo la línea de Cost et al. [5]. Estas CPN no determinísticas alimentan tokens en la CPN que modela la estructura normativa. Esto conlleva a la introducción de no determinismo en la CPN combinada. La mitad inferior de la figura 3 muestra parte de un modelo CPN de un protocolo de agente donde el arco denotado con 1 representa alguna enunciación de una ilocución por un agente. La transición objetivo de este arco, no solo mueve un token al siguiente estado de esta CPN, sino que también coloca un token en el lugar correspondiente a la escena normativa apropiada en el modelo CPN de la estructura normativa (a través del arco 2). La transición 3 finalmente pudo propagar ese token en forma de obligación, por ejemplo. Por lo tanto, a partir de una marca dada, son posibles muchas secuencias de ocurrencia diferentes dependiendo de las acciones de los agentes. Hacemos uso del conjunto de alcanzabilidad R para definir una situación en la que los agentes no pueden causar conflictos. 640 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) Figura 3: Construyendo la CPN combinada Def. 13. Dado una red N, una marcación M es resistente a conflictos si y solo si todas las marcaciones en R(N,M) son libres de conflictos. Verificar la libertad de conflicto de una marca se puede hacer en tiempo polinómico al revisar todos los lugares de la CPN en busca de fichas en conflicto. La libertad de conflicto de una secuencia de ocurrencias en la CPN que representa la estructura normativa también se puede lograr en tiempo polinómico, ya que esta secuencia es determinista dado un instante. Ya sea que una estructura normativa esté diseñada de manera segura corresponde a verificar la resistencia al conflicto de la marca inicial M0. Ahora, verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una marca se convierte en una tarea muy difícil. Corresponde al problema de alcanzabilidad en una CPN: ¿se puede alcanzar un estado o lograr una marcación que contenga un conflicto? Este problema de alcanzabilidad se sabe que es NP-completo para las Redes de Petri ordinarias [22] y dado que las CPNs son funcionalmente idénticas, no podemos esperar verificar la resistencia al conflicto de una estructura normativa fuera de línea en una cantidad razonable de tiempo. Por lo tanto, se necesitan mecanismos distribuidos en tiempo de ejecución para garantizar que una estructura normativa mantenga la consistencia. Presentamos un mecanismo de este tipo en la siguiente sección. 6. Una vez que se ha detectado un conflicto (según se define en la Sección 4), proponemos emplear el unificador para resolver el conflicto. En nuestro ejemplo, si las variables en prh(inform(a1, r1, a2, r2, p(Y, d), T )) no obtienen los valores especificados en la sustitución σ, entonces no habrá un conflicto. Sin embargo, en lugar de calcular el conjunto complementario de una sustitución (que puede ser un conjunto infinito), proponemos anotar la prohibición con el unificador mismo y usarlo para determinar qué variables no pueden ser en futuras unificaciones para evitar un conflicto. Por lo tanto, designamos las prohibiciones anotadas como prh(¯I) Σ, donde Σ = {σ1, . . . , σn}, es un conjunto de unificadores. Las normas anotadas se interpretan como construcciones deónticas con influencias limitadas, es decir, su efecto (sobre agentes, roles e ilocuciones) ha sido restringido por el conjunto Σ de unificadores. Una prohibición puede estar en conflicto con varias obligaciones en una escena normativa dada s = id, Δ y necesitamos registrar (y posiblemente evitar) todos estos conflictos. A continuación definimos un algoritmo que garantiza que una posición normativa se agregará a una escena normativa de tal manera que no cause conflictos. Aunque proponemos reducir las prohibiciones, la misma maquinaria puede utilizarse para definir la reducción de obligaciones en su lugar. Estas políticas diferentes dependen de la semántica deontológica prevista y de los requisitos de los sistemas abordados. Por ejemplo, algunas MASs pueden requerir que sus agentes no actúen en presencia de conflictos, es decir, que la obligación debe ser limitada. 6.1 Resolución de Conflictos Proponemos una forma detallada de resolver conflictos normativos a través de la unificación. Detectamos la superposición de las influencias de las normas, es decir, cómo afectan el comportamiento de los agentes involucrados, y reducimos la influencia de la posición normativa, utilizando adecuadamente las anotaciones al verificar si la norma se aplica a las ilocuciones. El algoritmo mostrado en la Figura 4 representa cómo mantenemos un conjunto de normas libre de conflictos. Agrega una norma dada N a un estado normativo Δ existente y libre de conflictos, obteniendo un nuevo estado normativo resultante Δ que es libre de conflictos, es decir, sus prohibiciones están anotadas con un conjunto de conjuntos de conflictos que indican qué asignaciones para variables deben evitarse para que no ocurran conflictos. algoritmo addNorm(N, Δ) comienza 1 marca de tiempo(N) 2 caso N de 3 per(¯I): Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 4 prh(I): si N ∈ Δ tal que conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Δ := Δ 5 de lo contrario Δ := Δ ∪ {N} 6 prh(¯I): 7 comienza 8 Σ := ∅ 9 para cada N ∈ Δ hacer 10 si conflicto(N, N , σ) entonces Σ := Σ ∪ {σ} 11 Δ := Δ ∪ {N Σ} 12 fin 13 obl(¯I): 14 comienza 15 Δ1 := ∅; Δ2 := ∅ 16 para cada (N Σ) ∈ Δ hacer 17 si N = prh(I) entonces 18 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 19 de lo contrario nulo 20 de lo contrario 21 si conflicto(N , N, σ) entonces 22 comienza 23 Δ1 := Δ1 ∪ {N Σ} 24 Δ2 := Δ2 ∪ {N (Σ ∪ {σ})} 25 fin 26 Δ := (Δ − Δ1) ∪ Δ2 ∪ {N} 27 fin 28 fin caso 29 devolver Δ fin Figura 4: Algoritmo para Preservar la Libertad de Conflictos El algoritmo utiliza una estructura de caso para diferenciar las diferentes posibilidades para una norma dada N. La línea 3 aborda el caso en el que la norma dada es un permiso: N simplemente se agrega a Δ. Las líneas 4-5 abordan el caso en el que intentamos agregar una prohibición de base a un estado normativo: si entra en conflicto con alguna obligación, entonces se descarta; de lo contrario, se agrega al estado normativo. Las líneas 6-12 describen la situación cuando la posición normativa a añadir es una prohibición no fundamentada. En este caso, el algoritmo inicializa Σ como un conjunto vacío y recorre en bucle (línea 9-10) las normas N en el estado normativo anterior Δ. Al encontrar uno que entre en conflicto con N, el algoritmo actualiza Σ agregando el conjunto de conflictos recién encontrado σ a él (línea 10). Al recorrer Δ en un bucle, podemos verificar cualquier conflicto entre la nueva prohibición y las obligaciones existentes, construyendo adecuadamente la anotación Σ que se utilizará al agregar N a Δ en la línea 11. Las líneas 13-27 describen cómo una nueva obligación se adapta a un estado normativo existente. Hacemos uso de dos conjuntos temporales inicialmente vacíos, Δ1, Δ2. El algoritmo recorre Δ (líneas 16-25) recogiendo aquellas prohibiciones anotadas N Σ que entran en conflicto con la nueva obligación. Sin embargo, hay dos casos con los que tratar: uno cuando un terreno La Sexta Internacional. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se encuentra la prohibición 641 (línea 17) y su excepción, que abarca prohibiciones no fundamentadas (línea 20). En ambos casos, la antigua prohibición se almacena en Δ1 (líneas 18 y 23) para ser posteriormente eliminada de Δ (línea 26). Sin embargo, en el caso de una prohibición no basada en tierra, el algoritmo actualiza su anotación de conjuntos de conflictos (línea 24). El bucle garantiza que se realice una búsqueda exhaustiva (lineal) a través de un estado normativo, verificando si la nueva obligación entra en conflicto con alguna prohibición existente, posiblemente actualizando las anotaciones de estas prohibiciones conflictivas. En la línea 26, el algoritmo construye el nuevo Δ actualizado eliminando las antiguas prohibiciones almacenadas en Δ1 y agregando las prohibiciones actualizadas almacenadas en Δ2 (si las hay), así como la nueva obligación N. Nuestro algoritmo propuesto es correcto en el sentido de que, para una posición normativa N dada y un estado normativo Δ, proporciona un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que todas las prohibiciones tienen anotaciones que registran cómo se unifican con las obligaciones existentes. Las anotaciones pueden estar vacías, sin embargo, este es el caso cuando tenemos una prohibición de base o una prohibición que no unifica/conflicta con ninguna obligación. Los permisos no afectan nuestro algoritmo y se manejan adecuadamente (línea 3). Cualquier intento de insertar una prohibición de base que entre en conflicto, produce el mismo estado normativo (línea 4). Cuando se agrega una nueva obligación, el algoritmo garantiza que se consideren todas las prohibiciones (líneas 14-27), lo que lleva a la eliminación de prohibiciones fundamentales conflictivas o la actualización de anotaciones de prohibiciones no fundamentales. El algoritmo siempre termina: los bucles están sobre un conjunto finito Δ y las verificaciones de conflictos y operaciones de conjunto siempre terminan. La complejidad del algoritmo es lineal: el conjunto Δ solo se examina una vez para cada posible caso de norma que se agregue. Al gestionar estados normativos, también puede ser necesario eliminar posiciones normativas. Esto es sencillo: los permisos se pueden eliminar sin problemas; las prohibiciones anotadas también se pueden eliminar sin más consideraciones; sin embargo, las obligaciones requieren cierto mantenimiento. Cuando una obligación debe ser eliminada, debemos verificarla con todas las prohibiciones anotadas para actualizar sus anotaciones. Aplicamos la verificación de conflictos y obtenemos un unificador, luego eliminamos este unificador de la anotación de prohibiciones. Invocamos el algoritmo de eliminación como removeNorm(N, Δ): devuelve un nuevo estado normativo Δ en el que se ha eliminado N, con posibles alteraciones en otras posiciones normativas como se explica. 6.2 Promulgación de una Estructura Normativa La promulgación de una estructura normativa implica la ejecución paralela y distribuida de escenas normativas y transiciones normativas. Con fines ilustrativos, a continuación describiremos la interacción entre las escenas normativas de pago y entrega y la transición normativa nt que las vincula en la mitad superior de la figura 2. Con este objetivo, considere por ejemplo que obl(inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), T) ∈ Δpago y que Δentrega sostiene prh(inform(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(Z, Q), T)). Tales estados indican que el cliente Jules está obligado a pagar £400 por 350 kg de cobre al contador Rod de acuerdo con la escena normativa de pago, mientras que Rod, asumiendo el papel de gerente de almacén en esta ocasión, tiene prohibido entregar cualquier cosa al cliente Jules de acuerdo con la escena normativa de entrega. Para cada escena normativa, el proceso de promulgación es el siguiente. En primer lugar, procesa su cola de mensajes entrantes que contiene tres tipos de mensajes: enunciados de la actividad a la que está vinculado; y comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar posiciones normativas. Por ejemplo, en nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago recopila la ilocución I = utt((inform(jules, cliente, rod, acc, pagar(cobre, 400, 350), 35)) que representa al cliente Jules pendiente de pago por cobre (a través de la flecha A en la figura 2). Las expresiones son marcadas con la hora y luego se agregan al estado normativo. Tendríamos Δpago = Δpago ∪ {I}, en nuestro ejemplo. Al recibir comandos normativos para agregar o eliminar una posición normativa, la escena normativa invoca el algoritmo de adición o eliminación correspondiente descrito en la Sección 6.1. En segundo lugar, la escena normativa reconoce su cambio de estado al enviar un mensaje de activación a cada transición normativa saliente a la que está conectada. En nuestro ejemplo, la escena normativa de pago estaría señalando su cambio de estado a la transición normativa nt. Para las transiciones normativas, el proceso funciona de manera diferente. Debido a que cada transición normativa controla la operación de una regla única, al recibir un mensaje de activación, sondea cada escena normativa entrante en busca de sustituciones para los esquemas ilocucionales relevantes en el LHS de su regla. En nuestro ejemplo, nt (siendo responsable de la regla descrita en la Sección 3.4), sondearía la escena normativa de pagos (a través de la flecha B) en busca de sustituciones. Al recibir respuestas de ellos (en forma de conjuntos de sustituciones junto con marcas de tiempo), se deben unificar las sustituciones de cada una de estas escenas normativas. Para cada unificación que encuentra, la regla se activa, y por lo tanto se envía el comando normativo correspondiente a la escena normativa de salida. La transición normativa luego lleva un registro del mensaje de activación que envió y de los sellos de tiempo de las posiciones normativas que desencadenaron la activación. Esto se hace para asegurar que las mismas posiciones normativas en el LHS de una regla solo activen su disparo una vez. En nuestro ejemplo, nt estaría recibiendo σ = {X/jules, Y/rod, Z/copper, Q/350} de la escena normativa de pago. Dado que las sustituciones en σ unifican con la regla nts, la regla se activa y se envía el comando normativo adicionar(entrega : obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350), T)) a la escena normativa de entrega para obligar a Rod a entregar al cliente Jules 350 kg de cobre. Después de eso, la escena normativa de entrega invocaría el algoritmo addNorm de la figura 4 con Δentrega y N = obl(rod, wm, jules, cliente, entregado(cobre, 350)) como argumentos. 7. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Y CONCLUSIONES Nuestras contribuciones en este artículo son triples. En primer lugar, presentamos un enfoque para la gestión y razonamiento sobre normas de manera distribuida. Hasta donde sabemos, hay poco trabajo publicado en esta dirección. En [8, 21], se presentan dos idiomas para la aplicación distribuida de normas en MAS. Sin embargo, en ambos trabajos, cada agente tiene una interfaz de mensajes local que reenvía mensajes legales de acuerdo con un conjunto de normas. Dado que estas interfaces son locales para cada agente, las normas solo pueden expresarse en términos de acciones de ese agente. Esta es una seria desventaja, por ejemplo, cuando se necesita activar una obligación hacia un agente debido a un mensaje de otro. La segunda contribución es la propuesta de una estructura normativa. La noción es fructífera porque permite la separación de preocupaciones normativas y procedimentales. La estructura normativa que proponemos pone de manifiesto la similitud entre la propagación de posiciones normativas y la propagación 642 de la Sexta Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) de tokens en Redes de Petri de Colores. Esa similitud sugiere fácilmente un mapeo entre ambos, y proporciona fundamentos para un tratamiento analítico conveniente de la estructura normativa, en general, y la complejidad de la detección de conflictos, en particular. La idea de modelar interacciones (en forma de conversaciones) a través de Redes de Petri ha sido investigada en [18], donde el medio de interacción y los agentes individuales son modelados como subredes de CPN que posteriormente se combinan para su análisis. En [5], las conversaciones se diseñan y analizan primero a nivel de CPNs y luego se traducen a protocolos. Lin et al. [20] mapean los esquemas de conversación a CPNs. Hasta donde sabemos, el uso de esta representación en el apoyo a la detección de conflictos en MAS regulados no ha sido reportado en otro lugar. Finalmente, presentamos un mecanismo distribuido para resolver conflictos normativos. Sartor [25] aborda los conflictos normativos desde el punto de vista de la teoría legal y sugiere una forma de ordenar las normas involucradas. Su idea se implementa en [12] pero requiere un recurso central para el mantenimiento de la norma. El enfoque para la detección y resolución de conflictos es una adaptación y extensión del trabajo sobre grafos de instanciación reportado en [17] y un algoritmo relacionado en [27]. El algoritmo presentado en el artículo actual se puede utilizar para gestionar estados normativos de forma distribuida: escenas normativas que ocurren en paralelo tienen un estado normativo asociado Δ al cual el algoritmo se aplica de forma independiente cada vez que se introduce una nueva norma. Estas tres contribuciones que presentamos en este artículo abren muchas posibilidades para trabajos futuros. Deberíamos mencionar primero que, como estrategia general, estamos trabajando en una generalización de la noción de estructura normativa para hacerla operar con diferentes modelos de <br>coordinación</br>, con un contenido deóntico más rico y sobre diferentes realizaciones computacionales de MAS regulados.
