The heterogeneity of its components turns the establishment of interaction or cooperation among them into a non trivial task, since agents may use different internal models and the decision about trust other agents is a crucial condition to the formation of agents cooperation. In this paper we propose the use of an ontology to deal with this issue. We experiment this idea by enhancing the ART reputation model with semantic data obtained from this ontology. This data is used during interaction among heterogeneous agents when exchanging reputation values and may be used for agents that use different reputation models. Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Multiagent systems General Terms Design, Experimentation, Standardization. 1. INTRODUCTION Open multiagent systems (MAS) are composed of autonomous distributed agents that may enter and leave the agent society at their will because open systems have no centralized control over the development of its parts [1]. Since agents are considered as autonomous entities, we cannot assume that there is a way to control their internal behavior. These features are interesting to obtain flexible and adaptive systems but they also create new risks about the reliability and the robustness of the system. Solutions to this problem have been proposed by the way of trust models where agents are endowed with a model of other agents that allows them to decide if they can or cannot trust another agent. Such trust decision is very important because it is an essential condition to the formation of agents cooperation. The trust decision processes use the concept of reputation as the basis of a decision. Reputation is a subject that has been studied in several works [4][5][8][9] with different approaches, but also with different semantics attached to the reputation concept. Casare and Sichman [2][3] proposed a Functional Ontology of Reputation (FORe) and some directions about how it could be used to allow the interoperability among different agent reputation models. This paper describes how the FORe can be applied to allow interoperability among agents that have different reputation models. An outline of this approach is sketched in the context of a testbed for the experimentation and comparison of trust models, the ART testbed [6]. 2. THE FUNCTIONAL ONTOLOGY OF REPUTATION (FORe) In the last years several computational models of reputation have been proposed [7][10][13][14]. As an example of research produced in the MAS field we refer to three of them: a cognitive reputation model [5], a typology of reputation [7] and the reputation model used in the ReGret system [9][10]. Each model includes its own specific concepts that may not exist in other models, or exist with a different name. For instance, Image and Reputation are two central concepts in the cognitive reputation model. These concepts do not exist in the typology of reputation or in the ReGret model. In the typology of reputation, we can find some similar concepts such as direct reputation and indirect reputation but there are some slight semantic differences. In the same way, the ReGret model includes four kinds of reputation (direct, witness, neighborhood and system) that overlap with the concepts of other models but that are not exactly the same. The Functional Ontology of Reputation (FORe) was defined as a common semantic basis that subsumes the concepts of the main reputation models. The FORe includes, as its kernel, the following concepts: reputation nature, roles involved in reputation formation and propagation, information sources for reputation, evaluation of reputation, and reputation maintenance. The ontology concept ReputationNature is composed of concepts such as IndividualReputation, GroupReputation and ProductReputation. Reputation formation and propagation involves several roles, played by the entities or agents that participate in those processes. The ontology defines the concepts ReputationProcess and ReputationRole. Moreover, reputation can be classified according to the origin of beliefs and opinions that can derive from several sources. The ontology defines the concept ReputationType which can be PrimaryReputation or SecondaryReputation. PrimaryReputation is composed of concepts ObservedReputation and DirectReputation and the concept SecondaryReputation is composed of concepts such as PropagatedReputation and CollectiveReputation. More details about the FORe can be found on [2][3]. 3. MAPPING THE AGENT REPUTATION MODELS TO THE FORe Visser et al [12] suggest three different ways to support semantic integration of different sources of information: a centralized approach, where each source of information is related to one common domain ontology; a decentralized approach, where every source of information is related to its own ontology; and a hybrid approach, where every source of information has its own ontology and the vocabulary of these ontologies are related to a common ontology. This latter organizes the common global vocabulary in order to support the source ontologies comparison. Casare and Sichman [3] used the hybrid approach to show that the FORe serves as a common ontology for several reputation models. Therefore, considering the ontologies which describe the agent reputation models we can define a mapping between these ontologies and the FORe whenever the ontologies use a common vocabulary. Also, the information concerning the mappings between the agent reputation models and the FORe can be directly inferred by simply classifying the resulting ontology from the integration of a given reputation model ontology and the FORe in an ontology tool with reasoning engine. For instance, a mapping between the Cognitive Reputation Model ontology and the FORe relates the concepts Image and Reputation to PrimaryReputation and SecondaryReputation from FORe, respectively. Also, a mapping between the Typology of Reputation and the FORe relates the concepts Direct Reputation and Indirect Reputation to PrimaryReputation and SecondaryReputation from FORe, respectively. Nevertheless, the concepts Direct Trust and Witness Reputation from the Regret System Reputation Model are mapped to PrimaryReputation and PropagatedReputation from FORe. Since PropagatedReputation is a sub-concept of SecondaryReputation, it can be inferred that Witness Reputation is also mapped to SecondaryReputation. 4. EXPERIMENTAL SCENARIOS USING THE ART TESTBED To exemplify the use of mappings from last section, we define a scenario where several agents are implemented using different agent reputation models. This scenario includes the agents interaction during the simulation of the game defined by ART [6] in order to describe the ways interoperability is possible between different trust models using the FORe. 4.1 The ART testbed The ART testbed provides a simulation engine on which several agents, using different trust models, may run. The simulation consists in a game where the agents have to decide to trust or not other agents. The games domain is art appraisal, in which agents are required to evaluate the value of paintings based on information exchanged among other agents during agents interaction. The information can be an opinion transaction, when an agent asks other agents to help it in its evaluation of a painting; or a reputation transaction, when the information required is about the reputation of another agent (a target) for a given era. More details about the ART testbed can be found in [6]. The ART common reputation model was enhanced with semantic data obtained from FORe. A general agent architecture for interoperability was defined [11] to allow agents to reason about the information received from reputation interactions. This architecture contains two main modules: the Reputation Mapping Module (RMM) which is responsible for mapping concepts between an agent reputation model and FORe; and the Reputation Reasoning Module (RRM) which is responsible for deal with information about reputation according to the agent reputation model. 4.2 Reputation transaction scenarios While including the FORe to the ART common reputation model, we have incremented it to allow richer interactions that involve reputation transaction. In this section we describe scenarios concerning reputation transactions in the context of ART testbed, but the first is valid for any kind of reputation transaction and the second is specific for the ART domain. 4.2.1 General scenario Suppose that agents A, B and C are implemented according to the aforementioned general agent architecture with the enhanced ART common reputation model, using different reputation models. Agent A uses the Typology of Reputation model, agent B uses the Cognitive Reputation Model and agent C uses the ReGret System model. Consider the interaction about reputation where agents A and B receive from agent C information about the reputation of agent Y. A big picture of this interaction is showed in Figure 2.

Interaction about reputation The information witness reputation from agent C is treated by its RMM and is sent as PropagatedReputation to both agents. The corresponding information in agent A reputation model is propagated reputation and in agent B reputation model is reputation. The way agents A and B make use of the information depends on their internal reputation model and their RRM implementation. 1048 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 4.2.2 ART scenario Considering the same agents A and B and the art appraisal domain of ART, another interesting scenario describes the following situation: agent A asks to agent B information about agents it knows that have skill on some specific painting era. In this case agent A wants information concerning the direct reputation agent B has about agents that have skill on an specific era, such as cubism. Following the same steps of the previous scenario, agent A message is prepared in its RRM using information from its internal model. A big picture of this interaction is in Figure 2. Typol. Ontology (agent = ?, value = ?, skill = cubism, reputation = directreputation) A (agent = ?, value = ?, skill = cubism, reputation = PrimaryReputation) CogMod. Ontology (agent = ?, value = ?, skill = cubism, reputation = image) B Typol. Ontology (agent = ?, value = ?, skill = cubism, reputation = directreputation) A (agent = ?, value = ?, skill = cubism, reputation = PrimaryReputation) CogMod. Ontology (agent = ?, value = ?, skill = cubism, reputation = image) B Figure 2. Interaction about specific types of reputation values Agent B response to agent A is processed in its RRM and it is composed of tuples (agent, value, cubism, image) , where the pair (agent, value) is composed of all agents and associated reputation values whose agent B knows their expertise about cubism by its own opinion. This response is forwarded to the RMM in order to be translated to the enriched common model and to be sent to agent A. After receiving the information sent by agent B, agent A processes it in its RMM and translates it to its own reputation model to be analyzed by its RRM. 5. CONCLUSION In this paper we present a proposal for reducing the incompatibility between reputation models by using a general agent architecture for reputation interaction which relies on a functional ontology of reputation (FORe), used as a globally shared reputation model. A reputation mapping module allows agents to translate information from their internal reputation model into the shared model and vice versa. The ART testbed has been enriched to use the ontology during agent transactions. Some scenarios were described to illustrate our proposal and they seem to be a promising way to improve the process of building reputation just using existing technologies. 6.

Estos datos se usan durante la interacción entre los agentes heterogéneos cuando se intercambian valores de reputación y pueden usarse para agentes que usan diferentes modelos de reputación. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos I.2.11 [Inteligencia artificial distribuida]: sistemas multiagentes Términos generales Diseño, experimentación, estandarización.1. Introducción Los sistemas multiagentes abiertos (MAS) están compuestos por agentes distribuidos autónomos que pueden ingresar y dejar a la sociedad de agentes en su testamento porque los sistemas abiertos no tienen un control centralizado sobre el desarrollo de sus piezas [1]. Dado que los agentes se consideran entidades autónomas, no podemos suponer que hay una manera de controlar su comportamiento interno. Estas características son interesantes para obtener sistemas flexibles y adaptativos, pero también crean nuevos riesgos sobre la confiabilidad y la robustez del sistema. Las soluciones a este problema se han propuesto por los modelos de confianza donde los agentes están dotados de un modelo de otros agentes que les permite decidir si pueden o no confiar en otro agente. Dicha decisión de confianza es muy importante porque es una condición esencial para la formación de la cooperación de los agentes. Los procesos de decisión de confianza utilizan el concepto de reputación como base de una decisión. La reputación es un tema que se ha estudiado en varias obras [4] [5] [8] [9] con diferentes enfoques, pero también con diferentes semánticas adjuntas al concepto de reputación. Casare y Sichman [2] [3] propusieron una ontología funcional de reputación (delantera) y algunas direcciones sobre cómo podría usarse para permitir la interoperabilidad entre los diferentes modelos de reputación de agentes. Este documento describe cómo se puede aplicar el frente para permitir la interoperabilidad entre los agentes que tienen diferentes modelos de reputación. Un resumen de este enfoque se esboza en el contexto de un Bed de prueba para la experimentación y comparación de modelos de confianza, el Bed Testbed [6].2. Se han propuesto la ontología funcional de la reputación (delantera) en los últimos años, se han propuesto varios modelos computacionales de reputación [7] [10] [13] [14]. Como ejemplo de investigación producida en el campo MAS, nos referimos a tres de ellos: un modelo de reputación cognitiva [5], una tipología de reputación [7] y el modelo de reputación utilizado en el sistema de arrepentimiento [9] [10]. Cada modelo incluye sus propios conceptos específicos que pueden no existir en otros modelos, o existir con un nombre diferente. Por ejemplo, la imagen y la reputación son dos conceptos centrales en el modelo de reputación cognitiva. Estos conceptos no existen en la tipología de la reputación o en el modelo de arrepentimiento. En la tipología de la reputación, podemos encontrar algunos conceptos similares, como la reputación directa y la reputación indirecta, pero hay algunas ligeras diferencias semánticas. De la misma manera, el modelo de arrepentimiento incluye cuatro tipos de reputación (directo, testigo, vecindario y sistema) que se superponen con los conceptos de otros modelos pero que no son exactamente lo mismo. La ontología funcional de la reputación (delantera) se definió como una base semántica común que subsume los conceptos de los principales modelos de reputación. El frente incluye, como su núcleo, los siguientes conceptos: naturaleza de reputación, roles involucrados en la formación y propagación de la reputación, fuentes de información para la reputación, evaluación de la reputación y mantenimiento de la reputación. La reputación conceptual de ontología se compone de conceptos como la representación individual, la groupreputación y la productreputación. La formación y propagación de la reputación implican varios roles, desempeñados por las entidades o agentes que participan en esos procesos. La ontología define el proceso de reputación y reputación de los conceptos. Además, la reputación se puede clasificar de acuerdo con el origen de las creencias y opiniones que pueden derivarse de varias fuentes. La ontología define el concepto de reputación de la reputación que puede ser la representación primaria o la reputación secundaria. La representación primaria está compuesta por conceptos observados, la reputación y la directrreputación y el concepto secundario se compone de conceptos tales como la representación propagada y la oportunidad colectiva. Se pueden encontrar más detalles sobre el frente en [2] [3].3. Mapeo de los modelos de reputación del agente a Fore Visser et al [12] sugieren tres formas diferentes de apoyar la integración semántica de diferentes fuentes de información: un enfoque centralizado, donde cada fuente de información está relacionada con una ontología de dominio común;un enfoque descentralizado, donde cada fuente de información está relacionada con su propia ontología;y un enfoque híbrido, donde cada fuente de información tiene su propia ontología y el vocabulario de estas ontologías está relacionado con una ontología común. Este último organiza el vocabulario global común para apoyar la comparación de ontologías de origen. Casare y Sichman [3] utilizaron el enfoque híbrido para mostrar que el frente sirve como una ontología común para varios modelos de reputación. Por lo tanto, teniendo en cuenta las ontologías que describen los modelos de reputación del agente, podemos definir un mapeo entre estas ontologías y el frente cada vez que las ontologías usan un vocabulario común. Además, la información sobre las asignaciones entre los modelos de reputación del agente y el frente se puede inferir directamente clasificando la ontología resultante a partir de la integración de un modelo de reputación dado y el frente en una herramienta de ontología con motor de razonamiento. Por ejemplo, un mapeo entre la ontología del modelo de reputación cognitiva y el frente relaciona la imagen de los conceptos y la reputación con la representación primaria y la reputación secundaria desde el principio, respectivamente. Además, un mapeo entre la tipología de la reputación y el frente relaciona los conceptos de reputación directa y reputación indirecta con la reputación primaria y la reputación secundaria desde el principio, respectivamente. Sin embargo, los conceptos dirigen la confianza y la reputación de los testigos del modelo de reputación del sistema de arrepentimiento se asignan a la representación primaria y la representación propagada desde el principio. Dado que la representación propagada es un subconcepto de la reputación secundaria, se puede inferir que la reputación de los testigos también se asigna a la reputación secundaria.4. Escenarios experimentales Usando el Bed de TRAT de ART para ejemplificar el uso de mapeos de la última sección, definimos un escenario en el que se implementen varios agentes utilizando diferentes modelos de reputación de agentes. Este escenario incluye la interacción de los agentes durante la simulación del juego definido por Art [6] para describir las formas en que la interoperabilidad es posible entre los diferentes modelos de confianza que usan el frente.4.1 La prueba de arte de Art, el Bed de la prueba de arte proporciona un motor de simulación en el que pueden ejecutarse varios agentes, utilizando diferentes modelos de confianza. La simulación consiste en un juego donde los agentes tienen que decidir confiar o no en otros agentes. El dominio de los juegos es la evaluación del arte, en la que los agentes deben evaluar el valor de las pinturas basadas en la información intercambiada entre otros agentes durante la interacción de los agentes. La información puede ser una transacción de opinión, cuando un agente pide a otros agentes que la ayuden en su evaluación de una pintura;o una transacción de reputación, cuando la información requerida es sobre la reputación de otro agente (un objetivo) para una era dada. Se pueden encontrar más detalles sobre el plato de prueba de arte en [6]. El modelo de reputación de Art Common se mejoró con los datos semánticos obtenidos de Fore. Se definió una arquitectura de agente general para la interoperabilidad [11] para permitir a los agentes razonar sobre la información recibida de las interacciones de reputación. Esta arquitectura contiene dos módulos principales: el Módulo de mapeo de reputación (RMM) que es responsable de mapear conceptos entre un modelo de reputación de agente y delantero;y el Módulo de razonamiento de reputación (RRM) que es responsable de tratar información sobre la reputación de acuerdo con el modelo de reputación del agente.4.2 Escenarios de transacción de reputación Si bien incluye el modelo de reputación común del arte al arte, lo hemos incrementado para permitir interacciones más ricas que implican transacciones de reputación. En esta sección describimos escenarios relacionados con las transacciones de reputación en el contexto de Art Testbed, pero el primero es válido para cualquier tipo de transacción de reputación y el segundo es específico para el dominio de ART.4.2.1 Escenario general Suponga que los agentes A, B y C se implementan de acuerdo con la arquitectura de agente general antes mencionado con el modelo de reputación común de arte mejorado, utilizando diferentes modelos de reputación. El agente A utiliza la tipología del modelo de reputación, el agente B utiliza el modelo de reputación cognitiva y el agente C utiliza el modelo de Remisión del Sistema. Considere la interacción sobre la reputación donde los agentes A y B reciben información del Agente C sobre la reputación del Agente Y. En la Figura 2 se muestra un panorama general de esta interacción. Ruébase de ontología (y, valor = 0.8, testigo de la reputación) c typol.

En este caso, el agente A desea información sobre la reputación directa El agente B tiene sobre agentes que tienen habilidad en una era específica, como el cubismo. Siguiendo los mismos pasos del escenario anterior, el agente un mensaje se prepara en su RRM utilizando información de su modelo interno. Un panorama general de esta interacción está en la Figura 2.

Esta respuesta se reenvía al RMM para ser traducido al modelo común enriquecido y se enviará al Agente A. Después de recibir la información enviada por el Agente B, el Agente A la procesa en su RMM y la traduce a su propio modelo de reputación para ser analizado por su RRM.5. Conclusión En este documento presentamos una propuesta para reducir la incompatibilidad entre los modelos de reputación mediante el uso de una arquitectura de agente general para la interacción de reputación que se basa en una ontología funcional de la reputación (delantera), utilizada como un modelo de reputación compartido a nivel mundial. Un módulo de mapeo de reputación permite a los agentes traducir información de su modelo de reputación interna en el modelo compartido y viceversa. El Bed de Test Test se ha enriquecido para usar la ontología durante las transacciones de agentes. Se describieron algunos escenarios para ilustrar nuestra propuesta y parecen ser una forma prometedora de mejorar el proceso de construcción de la reputación del solo uso de tecnologías existentes.6.

                "In the same way, the ReGret model includes four kinds of reputation (direct, witness, neighborhood and system) that overlap with the concepts of other models but that are not exactly the same.",
                "The Functional Ontology of Reputation (FORe) was defined as a common semantic basis that subsumes the concepts of the main reputation models.",
                "The FORe includes, as its kernel, the following concepts: reputation nature, roles involved in reputation formation and propagation, information sources for reputation, evaluation of reputation, and reputation maintenance.",

                "MAPPING THE AGENT REPUTATION MODELS TO THE FORe Visser et al [12] suggest three different ways to support semantic integration of different sources of information: a centralized approach, where each source of information is related to one common domain ontology; a decentralized approach, where every source of information is related to its own ontology; and a hybrid approach, where every source of information has its own ontology and the vocabulary of these ontologies are related to a common ontology.",

                "Casare and Sichman [3] used the hybrid approach to show that the FORe serves as a common ontology for several reputation models.",
                "Therefore, considering the ontologies which describe the agent reputation models we can define a mapping between these ontologies and the FORe whenever the ontologies use a common vocabulary.",
                "Also, the information concerning the mappings between the agent reputation models and the FORe can be directly inferred by simply classifying the resulting ontology from the integration of a given reputation model ontology and the FORe in an ontology tool with reasoning engine.",
                "For instance, a mapping between the Cognitive Reputation Model ontology and the FORe relates the concepts Image and Reputation to PrimaryReputation and SecondaryReputation from FORe, respectively.",

                "The simulation consists in a game where the agents have to decide to <br>trust</br> or not other agents.",
                "The games domain is art appraisal, in which agents are required to evaluate the value of paintings based on information exchanged among other agents during agents interaction.",
                "The information can be an opinion transaction, when an agent asks other agents to help it in its evaluation of a painting; or a reputation transaction, when the information required is about the reputation of another agent (a target) for a given era.",
