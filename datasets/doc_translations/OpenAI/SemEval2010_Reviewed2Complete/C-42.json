In this approach, an ensemble of geological models and production data of oil fields is used to forecast the dynamic response of oil wells. The Schlumberger ECLIPSE software is used for these simulations. Since models in the ensemble do not communicate, message-passing implementation is a good choice. Each model checks out an ECLIPSE license and therefore, parallelizability of reservoir simulations depends on the number licenses available. We have Grid-enabled the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation methodology for the TIGRE Grid computing environment. By pooling the licenses and computing resources across the collaborating institutions using GridWay metascheduler and TIGRE environment, the computational accuracy can be increased while reducing the simulation runtime. In this paper, we provide an account of our efforts in Gridenabling the ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation methodology. Potential benefits of this approach, observations and lessons learned will be discussed.

INTRODUCTION Grid computing [1] is an emerging collaborative computing paradigm to extend institution/organization specific high performance computing (HPC) capabilities greatly beyond local resources. Its importance stems from the fact that ground breaking research in strategic application areas such as bioscience and medicine, energy exploration and environmental modeling involve strong interdisciplinary components and often require intercampus collaborations and computational capabilities beyond institutional limitations. The Texas Internet Grid for Research and Education (TIGRE) [2,3] is a state funded cyberinfrastructure development project carried out by five (Rice, A&M, TTU, UH and UT Austin) major university systems - collectively called TIGRE Institutions. The purpose of TIGRE is to create a higher education Grid to sustain and extend research and educational opportunities across Texas. TIGRE is a project of the High Performance Computing across Texas (HiPCAT) [4] consortium. The goal of HiPCAT is to support advanced computational technologies to enhance research, development, and educational activities. The primary goal of TIGRE is to design and deploy state-of-the-art Grid middleware that enables integration of computing systems, storage systems and databases, visualization laboratories and displays, and even instruments and sensors across Texas. The secondary goal is to demonstrate the TIGRE capabilities to enhance research and educational opportunities in strategic application areas of interest to the State of Texas. These are bioscience and medicine, energy exploration and air quality modeling. Vision of the TIGRE project is to foster interdisciplinary and intercampus collaborations, identify novel approaches to extend academic-government-private partnerships, and become a competitive model for external funding opportunities. The overall goal of TIGRE is to support local, campus and regional user interests and offer avenues to connect with national Grid projects such as Open Science Grid [5], and TeraGrid [6]. Within the energy exploration strategic application area, we have Grid-enabled the ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) [7] approach for data assimilation in reservoir modeling and demonstrated the extensibility of the application using the TIGRE environment and the GridWay [8] metascheduler. Section 2 provides an overview of the TIGRE environment and capabilities. Application description and the need for Grid-enabling EnKF methodology is provided in Section 3. The implementation details and merits of our approach are discussed in Section 4. Conclusions are provided in Section 5. Finally, observations and lessons learned are documented in Section 6. 2. TIGRE ENVIRONMENT The TIGRE Grid middleware consists of minimal set of components derived from a subset of the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT) [9] which supports a variety of operating systems. The purpose of choosing a minimal software stack is to support applications at hand, and to simplify installation and distribution of client/server stacks across TIGRE sites. Additional components will be added as they become necessary. The PacMan [10] packaging and distribution mechanism is employed for TIGRE client/server installation and management. The PacMan distribution mechanism involves retrieval, installation, and often configuration of the packaged software. This approach allows the clients to keep current, consistent versions of TIGRE software. It also helps TIGRE sites to install the needed components on resources distributed throughout the participating sites. The TIGRE client/server stack consists of an authentication and authorization layer, Globus GRAM4-based job submission via web services (pre-web services installations are available up on request). The tools for handling Grid proxy generation, Grid-enabled file transfer and Grid-enabled remote login are supported. The pertinent details of TIGRE services and tools for job scheduling and management are provided below. 2.1. Certificate Authority The TIGRE security infrastructure includes a certificate authority (CA) accredited by the International Grid Trust Federation (IGTF) for issuing X. 509 user and resource Grid certificates [11]. The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), University of Texas at Austin is the TIGREs shared CA. The TIGRE Institutions serve as Registration Authorities (RA) for their respective local user base. For up-to-date information on securing user and resource certificates and their installation instructions see ref [2]. The users and hosts on TIGRE are identified by their distinguished name (DN) in their X.509 certificate provided by the CA. A native Grid-mapfile that contains a list of authorized DNs is used to authenticate and authorize user job scheduling and management on TIGRE site resources. At Texas Tech University, the users are dynamically allocated one of the many generic pool accounts. This is accomplished through the Grid User Management System (GUMS) [12]. 2.2. Job Scheduling and Management The TIGRE environment supports GRAM4-based job submission via web services. The job submission scripts are generated using XML. The web services GRAM translates the XML scripts into target cluster specific batch schedulers such as LSF, PBS, or SGE. The high bandwidth file transfer protocols such as GridFTP are utilized for staging files in and out of the target machine. The login to remote hosts for compilation and debugging is only through GSISSH service which requires resource authentication through X.509 certificates. The authentication and authorization of Grid jobs are managed by issuing Grid certificates to both users and hosts. The certificate revocation lists (CRL) are updated on a daily basis to maintain high security standards of the TIGRE Grid services. The TIGRE portal [2] documentation area provides a quick start tutorial on running jobs on TIGRE. 2.3. Metascheduler The metascheduler interoperates with the cluster level batch schedulers (such as LSF, PBS) in the overall Grid workflow management. In the present work, we have employed GridWay [8] metascheduler - a Globus incubator project - to schedule and manage jobs across TIGRE. The GridWay is a light-weight metascheduler that fully utilizes Globus functionalities. It is designed to provide efficient use of dynamic Grid resources by multiple users for Grid infrastructures built on top of Globus services. The TIGRE site administrator can control the resource sharing through a powerful built-in scheduler provided by GridWay or by extending GridWays external scheduling module to provide their own scheduling policies. Application users can write job descriptions using GridWays simple and direct job template format (see Section 4 for details) or standard Job Submission Description Language (JSDL). See section 4 for implementation details. 2.4. Customer Service Management System A TIGRE portal [2] was designed and deployed to interface users and resource providers. It was designed using GridPort [13] and is maintained by TACC. The TIGRE environment is supported by open source tools such as the Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) [14] for servicing trouble tickets, and MoinMoin [15] Wiki for TIGRE content and knowledge management for education, outreach and training. The links for OTRS and Wiki are consumed by the TIGRE portal [2] - the gateway for users and resource providers. The TIGRE resource status and loads are monitored by the Grid Port Information Repository (GPIR) service of the GridPort toolkit [13] which interfaces with local cluster load monitoring service such as Ganglia. The GPIR utilizes cron jobs on each resource to gather site specific resource characteristics such as jobs that are running, queued and waiting for resource allocation. 3. ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER APPLICATION The main goal of hydrocarbon reservoir simulations is to forecast the production behavior of oil and gas field (denoted as field hereafter) for its development and optimal management. In reservoir modeling, the field is divided into several geological models as shown in Figure 1. For accurate performance forecasting of the field, it is necessary to reconcile several geological models to the dynamic response of the field through history matching [16-20]. Figure 1. Cross-sectional view of the Field. Vertical layers correspond to different geological models and the nails are oil wells whose historical information will be used for forecasting the production behavior. (Figure Ref:http://faculty.smu.edu/zchen/research.html). The EnKF is a Monte Carlo method that works with an ensemble of reservoir models. This method utilizes crosscovariances [21] between the field measurements and the reservoir model parameters (derived from several models) to estimate prediction uncertainties. The geological model parameters in the ensemble are sequentially updated with a goal to minimize the prediction uncertainties. Historical production response of the field for over 50 years is used in these simulations. The main advantage of EnKF is that it can be readily linked to any reservoir simulator, and can assimilate latest production data without the need to re-run the simulator from initial conditions. Researchers in Texas are large subscribers of the Schlumberger ECLIPSE [22] package for reservoir simulations. In the reservoir modeling, each geological model checks out an ECLIPSE license. The simulation runtime of the EnKF methodology depends on the number of geological models used, number of ECLIPSE licenses available, production history of the field, and propagated uncertainties in history matching. The overall EnKF workflow is shown Figure 2. Figure 2. Ensemble Kaman Filter Data Assimilation Workflow. Each site has L licenses. At START, the master/control process (EnKF main program) reads the simulation configuration file for number (N) of models, and model-specific input files. Then, N working directories are created to store the output files. At the end of iteration, the master/control process collects the output files from N models and post processes crosscovariances [21] to estimate the prediction uncertainties. This information will be used to update models (or input files) for the next iteration. The simulation continues until the production histories are exhausted. Typical EnKF simulation with N=50 and field histories of 50-60 years, in time steps ranging from three months to a year, takes about three weeks on a serial computing environment. In parallel computing environment, there is no interprocess communication between the geological models in the ensemble. However, at the end of each simulation time-step, model-specific output files are to be collected for analyzing cross covariances [21] and to prepare next set of input files. Therefore, master-slave model in messagepassing (MPI) environment is a suitable paradigm. In this approach, the geological models are treated as slaves and are distributed across the available processors. The master Cluster or (TIGRE/GridWay) START Read Configuration File Create N Working Directories Create N Input files Model l Model 2 Model N. . . ECLIPSE on site A ECLIPSE on Site B ECLIPSE on Site Z Collect N Model Outputs, Post-process Output files END . . . process collects model-specific output files, analyzes and prepares next set of input files for the simulation. Since each geological model checks out an ECLIPSE license, parallelizability of the simulation depends on the number of licenses available. When the available number of licenses is less than the number of models in the ensemble, one or more of the nodes in the MPI group have to handle more than one model in a serial fashion and therefore, it takes longer to complete the simulation. A Petroleum Engineering Department usually procures 10-15 ECLIPSE licenses while at least ten-fold increase in the number of licenses would be necessary for industry standard simulations. The number of licenses can be increased by involving several Petroleum Engineering Departments that support ECLIPSE package. Since MPI does not scale very well for applications that involve remote compute clusters, and to get around the firewall issues with license servers across administrative domains, Grid-enabling the EnKF workflow seems to be necessary. With this motivation, we have implemented Grid-enabled EnKF workflow for the TIGRE environment and demonstrated parallelizability of the application across TIGRE using GridWay metascheduler. Further details are provided in the next section. 4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS To Grid-enable the EnKF approach, we have eliminated the MPI code for parallel processing and replaced with N single processor jobs (or sub-jobs) where, N is the number of geological models in the ensemble. These model-specific sub-jobs were distributed across TIGRE sites that support ECLIPSE package using the GridWay [8] metascheduler. For each sub-job, we have constructed a GridWay job template that specifies the executable, input and output files, and resource requirements. Since the TIGRE compute resources are not expected to change frequently, we have used static resource discovery policy for GridWay and the sub-jobs were scheduled dynamically across the TIGRE resources using GridWay. Figure 3 represents the sub-job template file for the GridWay metascheduler. Figure 3. GridWay Sub-Job Template In Figure 3, REQUIREMENTS flag is set to choose the resources that satisfy the application requirements. In the case of EnKF application, for example, we need resources that support ECLIPSE package. ARGUMENTS flag specifies the model in the ensemble that will invoke ECLIPSE at a remote site. INPUT_FILES is prepared by the EnKF main program (or master/control process) and is transferred by GridWay to the remote site where it is untared and is prepared for execution. Finally, OUTPUT_FILES specifies the name and location where the output files are to be written. The command-line features of GridWay were used to collect and process the model-specific outputs to prepare new set of input files. This step mimics MPI process synchronization in master-slave model. At the end of each iteration, the compute resources and licenses are committed back to the pool. Table 1 shows the sub-jobs in TIGRE Grid via GridWay using gwps command and for clarity, only selected columns were shown .

Job scheduling across TIGRE using GridWay Metascheduler. DM: Dispatch state, EM: Execution state, JID is the job id and HOST corresponds to site specific cluster and its local batch scheduler. When a job is submitted to GridWay, it will go through a series of dispatch (DM) and execution (EM) states. For DM, the states include pend(ing), prol(og), wrap(per), epil(og), and done. DM=prol means the job has been scheduled to a resource and the remote working directory is in preparation. DM=warp implies that GridWay is executing the wrapper which in turn executes the application. DM=epil implies the job has finished running at the remote site and results are being transferred back to the GridWay server. Similarly, when EM=pend implies the job is waiting in the queue for resource and the job is running when EM=actv. For complete list of message flags and their descriptions, see the documentation in ref [8]. We have demonstrated the Grid-enabled EnKF runs using GridWay for TIGRE environment. The jobs are so chosen that the runtime doesnt exceed more than a half hour. The simulation runs involved up to 20 jobs between A&M and TTU sites with TTU serving 10 licenses. For resource information, see Table I. One of the main advantages of Grid-enabled EnKF simulation is that both the resources and licenses are released back to the pool at the end of each simulation time step unlike in the case of MPI implementation where licenses and nodes are locked until the completion of entire simulation. However, the fact that each sub-job gets scheduled independently via GridWay could possibly incur another time delay caused by waiting in queue for execution in each simulation time step. Such delays are not expected EXECUTABLE=runFORWARD REQUIREMENTS=HOSTNAME=cosmos.tamu.edu | HOSTNAME=antaeus.hpcc.ttu.edu | HOSTNAME=minigar.hpcc.ttu.edu | ARGUMENTS=001 INPUT_FILES=001.in.tar OUTPUT_FILES=001.out.tar in MPI implementation where the node is blocked for processing sub-jobs (model-specific calculation) until the end of the simulation. There are two main scenarios for comparing Grid and cluster computing approaches. Scenario I: The cluster is heavily loaded. The conceived average waiting time of job requesting large number of CPUs is usually longer than waiting time of jobs requesting single CPU. Therefore, overall waiting time could be shorter in Grid approach which requests single CPU for each sub-job many times compared to MPI implementation that requests large number of CPUs at a single time. It is apparent that Grid scheduling is beneficial especially when cluster is heavily loaded and requested number of CPUs for the MPI job is not readily available. Scenario II: The cluster is relatively less loaded or largely available. It appears the MPI implementation is favorable compared to the Grid scheduling. However, parallelizability of the EnKF application depends on the number of ECLIPSE licenses and ideally, the number of licenses should be equal to the number of models in the ensemble. Therefore, if a single institution does not have sufficient number of licenses, the cluster availability doesnt help as much as it is expected. Since the collaborative environment such as TIGRE can address both compute and software resource requirements for the EnKF application, Grid-enabled approach is still advantageous over the conventional MPI implementation in any of the above scenarios. 5. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK TIGRE is a higher education Grid development project and its purpose is to sustain and extend research and educational opportunities across Texas. Within the energy exploration application area, we have Grid-enabled the MPI implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation methodology for reservoir characterization. This task was accomplished by removing MPI code for parallel processing and replacing with single processor jobs one for each geological model in the ensemble. These single processor jobs were scheduled across TIGRE via GridWay metascheduler. We have demonstrated that by pooling licenses across TIGRE sites, more geological models can be handled in parallel and therefore conceivably better simulation accuracy. This approach has several advantages over MPI implementation especially when a site specific cluster is heavily loaded and/or the number licenses required for the simulation is more than those available at a single site. Towards the future work, it would be interesting to compare the runtime between MPI, and Grid implementations for the EnKF application. This effort could shed light on quality of service (QoS) of Grid environments in comparison with cluster computing. Another aspect of interest in the near future would be managing both compute and license resources to address the job (or processor)-to-license ratio management. 6. OBSERVATIONS AND LESSIONS LEARNED The Grid-enabling efforts for EnKF application have provided ample opportunities to gather insights on the visibility and promise of Grid computing environments for application development and support. The main issues are industry standard data security and QoS comparable to cluster computing. Since the reservoir modeling research involves proprietary data of the field, we had to invest substantial efforts initially in educating the application researchers on the ability of Grid services in supporting the industry standard data security through role- and privilege-based access using X.509 standard. With respect to QoS, application researchers expect cluster level QoS with Grid environments. Also, there is a steep learning curve in Grid computing compared to the conventional cluster computing. Since Grid computing is still an emerging technology, and it spans over several administrative domains, Grid computing is still premature especially in terms of the level of QoS although, it offers better data security standards compared to commodity clusters. It is our observation that training and outreach programs that compare and contrast the Grid and cluster computing environments would be a suitable approach for enhancing user participation in Grid computing. This approach also helps users to match their applications and abilities Grids can offer. In summary, our efforts through TIGRE in Grid-enabling the EnKF data assimilation methodology showed substantial promise in engaging Petroleum Engineering researchers through intercampus collaborations. Efforts are under way to involve more schools in this effort. These efforts may result in increased collaborative research, educational opportunities, and workforce development through graduate/faculty research programs across TIGRE Institutions. 7.

En este enfoque, se utiliza un conjunto de modelos geológicos y datos de producción de campos petroleros para pronosticar la respuesta dinámica de los pozos de petróleo. El software Schlumberger Eclipse se utiliza para estas simulaciones. Dado que los modelos en el conjunto no se comunican, la implementación de pasos de mensajes es una buena opción. Cada modelo verifica una licencia de eclipse y, por lo tanto, la capacidad de paralela de las simulaciones de yacimientos depende de las licencias numéricas disponibles.

Categorías y descriptores de sujetos C 2.4 [Sistemas distribuidos]: Aplicaciones distribuidas Algoritmos de términos generales, diseño, rendimiento 1. Introducción a la computación de la cuadrícula [1] es un paradigma de computación colaborativo emergente para extender las capacidades específicas de informática de alto rendimiento (HPC) de la institución/organización (HPC) mucho más allá de los recursos locales. Su importancia se deriva del hecho de que la investigación innovadora en áreas de aplicación estratégica como la biosciencia y la medicina, la exploración energética y el modelado ambiental implican componentes interdisciplinarios fuertes y, a menudo, requieren colaboraciones de intercampus y capacidades computacionales más allá de las limitaciones institucionales. La red de Internet de Texas para Investigación y Educación (TIGRE) [2,3] es un proyecto de desarrollo de ciberinfraestructura financiado por el estado llevado a cabo por cinco sistemas universitarios principales (Rice, A&M, TTU, Uh y Ut Austin), colectivamente llamados instituciones Tigre. El propósito de Tigre es crear una cuadrícula de educación superior para mantener y extender las oportunidades de investigación y educación en todo Texas. Tigre es un proyecto de la computación de alto rendimiento en el consorcio de Texas (HIPCAT) [4]. El objetivo de HIPCAT es apoyar las tecnologías computacionales avanzadas para mejorar la investigación, el desarrollo y las actividades educativas. El objetivo principal de TIGRE es diseñar e implementar el middleware de la cuadrícula de última generación que permita la integración de sistemas informáticos, sistemas de almacenamiento y bases de datos, laboratorios y pantallas de visualización, e incluso instrumentos y sensores en Texas. El objetivo secundario es demostrar las capacidades de TIGRE para mejorar las oportunidades de investigación y educación en áreas de aplicación estratégica de interés para el estado de Texas. Estos son biosciencia y medicina, exploración energética y modelado de calidad del aire. La visión del proyecto TIGRE es fomentar las colaboraciones interdisciplinarias e intercampus, identificar enfoques novedosos para extender las asociaciones académicas-gubernamentales-privadas y convertirse en un modelo competitivo para oportunidades de financiamiento externas. El objetivo general de TIGRE es apoyar los intereses locales, del campus y regionales de los usuarios y ofrecer vías para conectarse con proyectos de red nacional como la cuadrícula de ciencias abiertas [5] y Teragrid [6]. Dentro del área de aplicación estratégica de exploración de energía, tenemos un enfoque de filtro Kalman (ENKF) [7] habilitado para la cuadrícula para la asimilación de datos en el modelado de yacimientos y demostramos la extensibilidad de la aplicación utilizando el entorno TIGRE y el metasquedulador de la red [8]. La Sección 2 proporciona una descripción general del entorno y las capacidades TIGRE. La descripción de la aplicación y la necesidad de metodología ENKF que habilita la red se proporciona en la Sección 3. Los detalles de implementación y los méritos de nuestro enfoque se discuten en la Sección 4. Las conclusiones se proporcionan en la Sección 5. Finalmente, las observaciones y las lecciones aprendidas se documentan en la Sección 6. 2. Entorno TIGRE El middleware de la cuadrícula Tigre consta de un conjunto mínimo de componentes derivados de un subconjunto del conjunto de herramientas de datos virtuales (VDT) [9] que admite una variedad de sistemas operativos. El propósito de elegir una pila de software mínima es admitir aplicaciones a mano y simplificar la instalación y distribución de las pilas de clientes/servidores en los sitios de TIGRE. Se agregarán componentes adicionales a medida que sean necesarios. El mecanismo de embalaje y distribución de Pacman [10] se emplea para la instalación y administración de Tigre Client/Server. El mecanismo de distribución de Pacman implica la recuperación, la instalación y, a menudo, la configuración del software empaquetado. Este enfoque permite a los clientes mantener versiones actuales y consistentes del software Tigre. También ayuda a los sitios de Tigre a instalar los componentes necesarios en los recursos distribuidos en los sitios participantes. La pila de clientes/servidores de Tigre consta de una capa de autenticación y autorización, envío de trabajo basado en Globus Gram4 a través de servicios web (las instalaciones de servicios previos a la WEB están disponibles a pedido). Se admiten las herramientas para manejar la generación de proxy de la cuadrícula, la transferencia de archivos habilitada para la cuadrícula y el inicio de sesión remoto habilitado para la red. A continuación se proporcionan los detalles pertinentes de los servicios y herramientas de TIGRE para la programación y gestión de empleos.2.1. Autoridad de certificado La infraestructura de seguridad TIGRE incluye una autoridad de certificado (CA) acreditada por la Federación Internacional de Fideicomiso de Grid (IGTF) para emitir X. 509 Certificados de cuadrícula de usuarios y recursos [11]. El Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), Universidad de Texas en Austin es el Tigres compartido CA. Las instituciones de Tigre sirven como autoridades de registro (RA) para su respectiva base de usuarios locales. Para obtener información actualizada sobre la obtención de certificados de usuarios y recursos y sus instrucciones de instalación, consulte Ref [2]. Los usuarios y los hosts en Tigre se identifican por su nombre distinguido (DN) en su certificado X.509 proporcionado por la CA. Un mapas de cuadrícula nativo que contiene una lista de DNS autorizados se utiliza para autenticar y autorizar la programación y gestión de trabajos del usuario en los recursos del sitio de Tigre. En la Universidad de Texas Tech, los usuarios están asignados dinámicamente una de las muchas cuentas de piscinas genéricas. Esto se logra a través del sistema de gestión de usuarios de la red (Gums) [12].2.2. Programación y gestión de empleo El entorno TIGRE admite el envío de empleo basado en Gram4 a través de servicios web. Los scripts de envío de trabajo se generan usando XML. El GRAM de servicios web traduce los scripts XML en programadores de lotes específicos del clúster de destino como LSF, PBS o SGE. Los protocolos de transferencia de archivos de alto ancho de banda, como GRIDFTP, se utilizan para organizar archivos dentro y fuera de la máquina de destino. El inicio de sesión en hosts remotos para la compilación y la depuración es solo a través del servicio GSISSH que requiere autenticación de recursos a través de certificados X.509. La autenticación y la autorización de los trabajos de la red se gestionan mediante la emisión de certificados de red a usuarios y hosts. Las listas de revocación de certificados (CRL) se actualizan diariamente para mantener altos estándares de seguridad de los servicios de red de Tigre. El área de documentación de Tigre Portal [2] proporciona un tutorial de inicio rápido sobre la ejecución de trabajos en Tigre.2.3. MetaScheduler El MetaScheduler interopera con los programadores de lotes de nivel de clúster (como LSF, PBS) en la gestión general del flujo de trabajo de la cuadrícula. En el presente trabajo, hemos empleado la vía de red [8] Metascheduler, un proyecto de incubadora Globus, para programar y administrar trabajos en Tigre. La red es un metasquedulador de peso ligero que utiliza completamente las funcionalidades del globo. Está diseñado para proporcionar un uso eficiente de recursos de cuadrícula dinámica por parte de múltiples usuarios para infraestructuras de cuadrícula construidas en la parte superior de los servicios de Globus. El administrador del sitio de Tigre puede controlar el intercambio de recursos a través de un poderoso programador incorporado proporcionado por la red o extendiendo el módulo de programación externa de las redes de cuadrícula para proporcionar sus propias políticas de programación. Los usuarios de la aplicación pueden escribir descripciones de trabajo utilizando el formato de plantilla de trabajo simple y directa (consulte la Sección 4 para más detalles) o el lenguaje de descripción de envío de trabajo estándar (JSDL). Consulte la Sección 4 para obtener detalles de implementación.2.4. Sistema de gestión de servicio al cliente Un portal de Tigre [2] fue diseñado e implementado para interfaz usuarios y proveedores de recursos. Fue diseñado usando Gridport [13] y es mantenido por TACC. El entorno TIGRE está respaldado por herramientas de código abierto, como el Sistema de solicitud de boletos abiertos (OTRS) [14] para el servicio de los boletos de problemas y la wiki de Moinmoin [15] para el contenido de Tigre y la gestión del conocimiento para la educación, la divulgación y la capacitación. Los enlaces para OTR y Wiki son consumidos por el portal de Tigre [2]: la puerta de enlace para usuarios y proveedores de recursos. El estado y las cargas del recurso TIGRE se controlan mediante el servicio del repositorio de información del puerto de cuadrícula (GPR) del kit de herramientas de la red de red [13] que interactúa con el servicio de monitoreo de carga de clúster local como los ganglios. El GPIR utiliza trabajos CRON en cada recurso para recopilar características de recursos específicas del sitio, como trabajos que se ejecutan, se colocan en cola y esperan la asignación de recursos.3. Aplicación del filtro Kalman del conjunto El objetivo principal de las simulaciones de yacimientos de hidrocarburos es pronosticar el comportamiento de producción del campo de petróleo y gas (denotado como campo en adelante) por su desarrollo y manejo óptimo. En el modelado del depósito, el campo se divide en varios modelos geológicos como se muestra en la Figura 1. Para el pronóstico de rendimiento preciso del campo, es necesario conciliar varios modelos geológicos con la respuesta dinámica del campo a través de la coincidencia de la historia [16-20]. Figura 1. Vista transversal del campo. Las capas verticales corresponden a diferentes modelos geológicos y las uñas son pozos de aceite cuya información histórica se utilizará para pronosticar el comportamiento de producción.(Figura Ref: http: //faculty.smu.edu/zchen/research.html). El ENKF es un método Monte Carlo que funciona con un conjunto de modelos de yacimientos. Este método utiliza covariaciones cruzadas [21] entre las mediciones de campo y los parámetros del modelo de yacimiento (derivados de varios modelos) para estimar las incertidumbres de predicción. Los parámetros del modelo geológico en el conjunto se actualizan secuencialmente con el objetivo de minimizar las incertidumbres de predicción. La respuesta de producción histórica del campo durante más de 50 años se usa en estas simulaciones. La principal ventaja de ENKF es que se puede vincular fácilmente a cualquier simulador de depósito, y puede asimilar los últimos datos de producción sin la necesidad de volver a ejecutar el simulador de las condiciones iniciales. Los investigadores en Texas son grandes suscriptores del paquete Schlumberger Eclipse [22] para simulaciones de yacimientos. En el modelado del depósito, cada modelo geológico verifica una licencia de eclipse. El tiempo de ejecución de simulación de la metodología ENKF depende del número de modelos geológicos utilizados, el número de licencias de eclipse disponibles, el historial de producción del campo y las incertidumbres propagadas en la coincidencia de la historia. El flujo de trabajo general de ENKF se muestra en la Figura 2. Figura 2. Conjunto Kaman Filtro Data Assimilación de flujo de trabajo. Cada sitio tiene L licencias. Al inicio, el proceso de maestría/control (programa principal de ENKF) lee el archivo de configuración de simulación para el número (n) de los modelos y los archivos de entrada específicos del modelo. Luego, se crean directorios de trabajo para almacenar los archivos de salida. Al final de la iteración, el proceso de maestría/control recopila los archivos de salida de los modelos n y los procesos posteriores a las covariaciones cruzadas [21] para estimar las incertidumbres de predicción. Esta información se utilizará para actualizar modelos (o archivos de entrada) para la siguiente iteración. La simulación continúa hasta que se agotan las historias de producción. La simulación típica de ENKF con N = 50 e historias de campo de 50-60 años, en pasos de tiempo que van de tres meses a un año, lleva aproximadamente tres semanas en un entorno de computación en serie. En el entorno informático paralelo, no existe una comunicación entre procesos entre los modelos geológicos en el conjunto. Sin embargo, al final de cada paso de tiempo de simulación, se deben recopilar archivos de salida específicos del modelo para analizar las covarianzas cruzadas [21] y para preparar el siguiente conjunto de archivos de entrada. Por lo tanto, el modelo maestro-esclavo en el entorno de paso de mensajes (MPI) es un paradigma adecuado. En este enfoque, los modelos geológicos se tratan como esclavos y se distribuyen en los procesadores disponibles. El clúster maestro o (Tigre/Gridway) inicia el archivo de configuración de lectura.. Eclipse en el sitio A Eclipse en el sitio B Eclipse en el sitio Z COMECT N SALIDAS DEL MODELO, FINALES DE POSTRO A POSPROCO...El proceso recopila archivos de salida específicos del modelo, analiza y prepara el siguiente conjunto de archivos de entrada para la simulación. Dado que cada modelo geológico verifica una licencia de eclipse, la paralela de la simulación depende de la cantidad de licencias disponibles. Cuando el número de licencias disponible es menor que el número de modelos en el conjunto, uno o más de los nodos en el grupo MPI tienen que manejar más de un modelo de manera en serie y, por lo tanto, lleva más tiempo completar la simulación. Un departamento de ingeniería de petróleo generalmente obtiene 10-15 licencias de eclipse, mientras que al menos un aumento de diez veces en el número de licencias sería necesario para las simulaciones estándar de la industria. El número de licencias se puede aumentar al involucrar a varios departamentos de ingeniería de petróleo que admiten el paquete Eclipse. Dado que MPI no escala muy bien para las aplicaciones que involucran grupos de cómputo remotos, y para evitar los problemas de firewall con los servidores de licencias en los dominios administrativos, parece necesaria que habilitar el flujo de trabajo ENKF el flujo de trabajo ENKF. Con esta motivación, hemos implementado el flujo de trabajo ENKF habilitado para la red para el entorno TIGRE y demostrado la paralelización de la aplicación a través de TIGRE utilizando metasquedulador de la red. Se proporcionan más detalles en la siguiente sección.4. Detalles de implementación para habilitar el enfoque ENKF, hemos eliminado el código MPI para el procesamiento paralelo y reemplazado por n trabajos de procesador único (o subjobs) donde, n es el número de modelos geológicos en el conjunto. Estos sub-Jobs específicos del modelo se distribuyeron en sitios TIGRE que admiten el paquete Eclipse utilizando el metasquedulador de la red [8]. Para cada submob, hemos construido una plantilla de trabajo de vía de cuadrícula que especifica los archivos ejecutables, de entrada y salida, y los requisitos de recursos. Dado que no se espera que los recursos de cómputo de Tigre cambien con frecuencia, hemos utilizado la política de descubrimiento de recursos estáticos para la red de red y los sub-Jobs se programaron dinámicamente a través de los recursos de Tigre utilizando la red. La Figura 3 representa el archivo de plantilla de submobo para el metasquedulador de la red. Figura 3. Plantilla de subjob de la red en la Figura 3, el indicador de requisitos está configurado para elegir los recursos que satisfacen los requisitos de la aplicación. En el caso de la aplicación ENKF, por ejemplo, necesitamos recursos que admitan el paquete Eclipse. El indicador de argumentos especifica el modelo en el conjunto que invocará Eclipse en un sitio remoto. Input_files es preparado por el programa principal de ENKF (o proceso maestro/de control) y se transfiere mediante una vía de cuadrícula al sitio remoto donde no está grabado y está preparado para la ejecución. Finalmente, Output_Files especifica el nombre y la ubicación donde se escribirán los archivos de salida. Las características de la línea de comandos de la red de cuadrícula se usaron para recopilar y procesar las salidas específicas del modelo para preparar un nuevo conjunto de archivos de entrada. Este paso imita la sincronización del proceso MPI en el modelo maestro-esclavo. Al final de cada iteración, los recursos y licencias de cómputo se comprometen a la piscina. La Tabla 1 muestra los sub-Jobs en la cuadrícula Tigre a través de la red utilizando el comando GWPS y, para mayor claridad, solo se mostraron columnas seleccionadas.

Programación de empleo a través de Tigre utilizando Metascheduler de red. DM: Dispatch State, EM: Ejecution State, JID es la identificación de trabajo y el host corresponde al clúster específico del sitio y su planificador de lotes local. Cuando se envía un trabajo a la red, pasará por una serie de estados de envío (DM) y ejecución (EM). Para DM, los estados incluyen PEND (ING), Prol (OG), WRAP (PER), EPIL (OG) y Hecho. DM = PROM significa que el trabajo ha sido programado para un recurso y el directorio de trabajo remoto está en preparación. DM = WarP implica que la red de cuadrícula está ejecutando el envoltorio que a su vez ejecuta la aplicación. DM = EPIL implica que el trabajo ha terminado de ejecutarse en el sitio remoto y los resultados se están transfiriendo al servidor de la red. Del mismo modo, cuando EM = Pend implica que el trabajo está esperando en la cola de recursos y el trabajo se ejecuta cuando EM = ACTV. Para obtener una lista completa de banderas de mensajes y sus descripciones, consulte la documentación en Ref [8]. Hemos demostrado las ejecuciones de ENKF habilitadas para la cuadrícula utilizando la red para el entorno TIGRE. Los trabajos son tan elegidos que el tiempo de ejecución no excede más de media hora. La simulación se ejecuta hasta 20 empleos entre los sitios A&M y TTU con TTU que sirve 10 licencias. Para obtener información sobre recursos, consulte la Tabla I. Una de las principales ventajas de la simulación ENKF habilitada para la red es que tanto los recursos como las licencias se devuelven al grupo al final de cada paso de tiempo de simulación, a diferencia del caso de la implementación de MPI, donde las licencias y los nodos están bloqueados hasta la finalización de completosimulación. Sin embargo, el hecho de que cada submob se programe de forma independiente a través de la red de red podría incurrir en otro retraso de tiempo causado por esperar en la cola para la ejecución en cada paso de tiempo de simulación. No se esperan tales retrasos ejecutables = requisitos runforward = hostname = cosmos.tamu.edu |Hostname = antaeus.hpcc.ttu.edu |Hostname = minigar.hpcc.ttu.edu |Argumentos = 001 input_files = 001.in.tar output_files = 001.out.tar en la implementación de MPI donde el nodo está bloqueado para procesar subjobs (cálculo específico del modelo) hasta el final de la simulación. Hay dos escenarios principales para comparar los enfoques de computación de la red y clúster. Escenario I: El clúster está muy cargado. El tiempo de espera promedio concebido del trabajo que solicita un gran número de CPU suele ser más largo que el tiempo de espera de los trabajos que solicitan una CPU única. Por lo tanto, el tiempo de espera general podría ser más corto en el enfoque de la red que solicita una CPU única para cada subchob muchas veces en comparación con la implementación de MPI que solicita una gran cantidad de CPU en un solo momento. Es evidente que la programación de la red es beneficiosa, especialmente cuando el clúster está muy cargado y el número de CPU solicitados para el trabajo de MPI no está fácilmente disponible. Escenario II: el clúster está relativamente menos cargado o en gran medida disponible. Parece que la implementación de MPI es favorable en comparación con la programación de la cuadrícula. Sin embargo, la paralelización de la aplicación ENKF depende del número de licencias de eclipse e idealmente, el número de licencias debe ser igual al número de modelos en el conjunto. Por lo tanto, si una sola institución no tiene suficiente número de licencias, la disponibilidad del clúster no ayuda tanto como se espera. Dado que el entorno colaborativo, como Tigre, puede abordar los requisitos de recursos de cómputo y software para la aplicación ENKF, el enfoque habilitado para la red sigue siendo ventajoso sobre la implementación convencional de MPI en cualquiera de los escenarios anteriores.5. Conclusiones y el trabajo futuro Tigre es un proyecto de desarrollo de redes de educación superior y su propósito es mantener y extender las oportunidades de investigación y educación en todo Texas. Dentro del área de aplicación de exploración de energía, tenemos la implementación de MPI de la metodología de asimilación de datos del filtro Kalman para la caracterización del depósito. Esta tarea se logró eliminando el código MPI para el procesamiento paralelo y el reemplazo con trabajos de procesador único uno para cada modelo geológico en el conjunto. Estos trabajos de procesadores individuales se programaron en Tigre a través de Metascheduler de red. Hemos demostrado que al agrupar las licencias en los sitios de Tigre, se pueden manejar más modelos geológicos en paralelo y, por lo tanto, posiblemente mejor precisión de simulación. Este enfoque tiene varias ventajas sobre la implementación de MPI, especialmente cuando un clúster específico del sitio está muy cargado y/o las licencias numéricas requeridas para la simulación son más que las disponibles en un solo sitio. Hacia el trabajo futuro, sería interesante comparar el tiempo de ejecución entre MPI y las implementaciones de la red para la aplicación ENKF. Este esfuerzo podría arrojar luz sobre la calidad del servicio (QoS) de entornos de cuadrícula en comparación con la computación de clúster. Otro aspecto del interés en el futuro cercano sería administrar recursos de cálculo y licencia para abordar la gestión de la relación trabajo (o procesador)-licencia.6. Las observaciones y las lesiones aprendieron que los esfuerzos de habilitación de la red para la aplicación ENKF han brindado amplias oportunidades para reunir información sobre la visibilidad y la promesa de entornos de computación de la red para el desarrollo y el soporte de aplicaciones. Los principales problemas son la seguridad de datos estándar de la industria y los QoS comparables a la computación de clúster. Dado que la investigación de modelado de embalses involucra datos propietarios del campo, tuvimos que invertir esfuerzos sustanciales inicialmente en la educación de los investigadores de aplicaciones sobre la capacidad de los servicios de red para apoyar la seguridad de los datos estándar de la industria a través del acceso basado en roles y privilegios utilizando X.509 Standard. Con respecto a los QoS, los investigadores de aplicaciones esperan QoS de nivel de clúster con entornos de cuadrícula. Además, hay una curva de aprendizaje pronunciada en la computación de la red en comparación con la computación de clúster convencional. Dado que la computación en la red sigue siendo una tecnología emergente, y abarca varios dominios administrativos, la informática de la red sigue siendo prematura, especialmente en términos del nivel de QoS, aunque ofrece mejores estándares de seguridad de datos en comparación con los grupos de productos básicos. Es nuestra observación que los programas de capacitación y divulgación que comparan y contrastan los entornos de computación de la red y clúster sería un enfoque adecuado para mejorar la participación del usuario en la informática de la red. Este enfoque también ayuda a los usuarios a igualar sus aplicaciones y habilidades que las cuadrículas pueden ofrecer. En resumen, nuestros esfuerzos a través de TIGRE en la metodología de asimilación de datos ENKF que habilitan la red mostraron una promesa sustancial para involucrar a los investigadores de ingeniería de petróleo a través de colaboraciones de intercampus. Se están realizando esfuerzos para involucrar más escuelas en este esfuerzo. Estos esfuerzos pueden dar como resultado una mayor investigación colaborativa, oportunidades educativas y desarrollo de la fuerza laboral a través de programas de investigación de posgrado/facultad en las instituciones de Tigre.7.

        "Since the reservoir modeling research involves proprietary data of the field, we had to invest substantial efforts initially in educating the application researchers on the ability of Grid services in supporting the industry standard data security through role- and privilege-based access using X.509 standard.",
        "With respect to QoS, application researchers expect cluster level QoS with Grid environments.",
        "Also, there is a steep learning curve in Grid computing compared to the conventional cluster computing.",
        "Since Grid computing is still an emerging technology, and it spans over several administrative domains, Grid computing is still premature especially in terms of the level of QoS although, it offers better data security standards compared to commodity clusters.",

                "Since the reservoir modeling research involves proprietary data of the field, we had to invest substantial efforts initially in educating the application researchers on the ability of Grid services in supporting the industry standard data security through role- and privilege-based access using X.509 standard.",
                "With respect to QoS, application researchers expect cluster level QoS with Grid environments.",

                "Since Grid computing is still an emerging technology, and it spans over several administrative domains, Grid computing is still premature especially in terms of the level of QoS although, it offers better data security standards compared to commodity clusters.",
