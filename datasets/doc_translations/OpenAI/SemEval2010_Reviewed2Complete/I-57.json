Our starting point is to consider an agent attempting to estimate the utility of a contract, and we show that this leads to a model of computational trust whereby an agent must determine a vector of estimates that represent the probability that any dimension of the contract will be successfully fulfilled, and a covariance matrix that describes the uncertainty and correlations in these probabilities. We present a formalism based on the Dirichlet distribution that allows an agent to calculate these probabilities and correlations from their direct experience of contract outcomes, and we show that this leads to superior estimates compared to an alternative approach using multiple independent beta distributions. We then show how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to communicate and fuse reputation within a decentralised reputation system. Finally, we present a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within such systems. This solution uses the notion of private and shared information, and provides estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding bias and overconfidence.

INTRODUCTION The role of computational models of trust within multi-agent systems in particular, and open distributed systems in general, has recently generated a great deal of research interest. In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments. To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review). Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11]. This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means. In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents. Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety). However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7]. This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made. Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations. For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity. A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time. Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension. To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details). To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts. The starting point for our work is to consider how an agent can estimate the utility that it will derive from interacting with a supplier. Here we use standard approaches from the literature of data fusion (since this is a well developed field where the notion of multi-dimensional correlated estimates is well established1 ) to show that this naturally leads to a trust model where the agent must estimate probabilities and correlations over 1 In this context, the multiple dimensions typically represent the physical coordinates of a target being tracked, and correlations arise through the operation and orientation of sensors. 1070 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS multiple dimensions. Building upon this, we then devise a novel trust model that addresses the three desiderata discussed above. In more detail, in this paper we extend the state of the art in four key ways: 1. We devise a novel multi-dimensional probabilistic trust model that enables an agent to estimate the expected utility of a contract, by estimating (i) the probability that each contract dimension will be successfully fulfilled, and (ii) the correlations between these estimates. 2. We present an exact probabilistic model based upon the Dirichlet distribution that allows agents to use their direct experience of contract outcomes to calculate the probabilities and correlations described above. We then benchmark this solution and show that it leads to good estimates. 3. We show that agents can use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution in order to exchange reputation reports with one another. The sufficient statistics represent aggregations of their direct experience, and thus, express contract outcomes in a compact format with no loss of information. 4. We show that, while being efficient, the aggregation of contract outcomes can lead to double counting, and rumour propagation, in decentralised reputation systems. Thus, we present a novel solution based upon the idea of private and shared information. We show that it yields estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding overconfidence. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: in section 2 we review related work. In section 3 we present our notation for a single dimensional contract, before introducing our multi-dimensional trust model in section 4. In sections 5 and 6 we discuss communicating reputation, and present our solution to rumour propagation in decentralised reputation systems. We conclude in section 7. 2. RELATED WORK The need for a multi-dimensional trust model has been recognised by a number of researchers. Sabater and Sierra present a model of reputation, in which agents form contracts based on multiple variables (such as delivery date and quality), and define impressions as subjective evaluations of the outcome of these contracts. They provide heuristic approaches to combining these impressions to form a measure they call subjective reputation. Likewise, Griffiths decomposes overall trust into a number of different dimensions such as success, cost, timeliness and quality [4]. In his case, each dimension is scored as a real number that represents a comparative value with no strong semantic meaning. He develops an heuristic rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers. Whilst, he comments that the trust values could have some associated confidence level, heuristics for updating these levels are not presented. Gujral et al. take a similar approach and present a trust model over multiple domain specific dimensions [5]. They define multidimensional goal requirements, and evaluate an expected payoff based on a suppliers estimated behaviour. These estimates are, however, simple aggregations over the direct experience of several agents, and there is no measure of the uncertainty. Nevertheless, they show that agents who select suppliers based on these multiple dimensions outperform those who consider just a single one. By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension. Jøsang and Ismail describe the Beta Reputation System whereby the reputation of an agent is compiled from the positive and negative reports from other agents who have interacted with it [6]. The beta distribution represents a natural choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a principled means of representing uncertainty. Moreover, they provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques to deal with reputations that may change over time. Likewise, Teacy et al. use the beta distribution to describe an agents belief in the probability that another agent will successfully fulfill its commitments [11]. They present a formalism using a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other agents. They provide a number of extensions to this initial model, and, in particular, they consider that agents may not always truthfully report their trust estimates. Thus, they present a principled approach to detecting and removing inconsistent reports. Our work builds upon these more principled approaches. However, the starting point of our approach is to consider an agent that is attempting to estimate the expected utility of a contract. We show that estimating this expected utility requires that an agent must estimate the probability with which the supplier will fulfill its contract. In the single-dimensional case, this naturally leads to a trust model using the beta distribution (as per Jøsang and Ismail and Teacy et al.). However, we then go on to extend this analysis to multiple dimensions, where we use the natural extension of the beta distribution, namely the Dirichlet distribution, to represent the agents belief over multiple dimensions. 3. SINGLE-DIMENSIONAL TRUST Before presenting our multi-dimensional trust model, we first introduce the notation and formalism that we will use by describing the more familiar single dimensional case. We consider an agent who must decide whether to engage in a future contract with a supplier. This contract will lead to some outcome, o, and we consider that o = 1 if the contract is successfully fulfilled, and o = 0 if not2 . In order for the agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract. We assume that in the case that the contract is successfully fulfilled, the agent derives a utility u(o = 1), otherwise it receives no utility3 . Now, given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the supplier will fulfill the contract, it should consider the expected utility that it will derive, E[U], and this is given by: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) where p(o = 1) is the probability that the supplier will successfully fulfill the contract. However, whilst u(o = 1) is known by the agent, p(o = 1) is not. The best the agent can do is to determine a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct experience of previous contract outcomes. Given that it has been able to do so, it can then determine an estimate of the expected utility4 of the contract, E[E[U]], and a measure of its uncertainty in this expected utility, Var(E[U]). This uncertainty is important since a risk averse agent may make a decision regarding a contract, 2 Note that we only consider binary contract outcomes, although extending this to partial outcomes is part of our future work. 3 Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is derived from an unsuccessful outcome. 4 Note that this is often called the expected expected utility, and this is the notation that we adopt here [2]. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1071 not only on its estimate of the expected utility of the contract, but also on the probability that the expected utility will exceed some minimum amount. These two properties are given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) where ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) are the estimate and uncertainty of the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, and are calculated from the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) that the agent determines from its direct experience. The utility based approach that we present here provides an attractive motivation for this model of Teacy et al. [11]. Now, in the case of binary contract outcomes, the beta distribution is the natural choice to represent the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) since within Bayesian statistics this well known to be the conjugate prior for binomial observations [3]. By adopting the beta distribution, we can calculate ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) using standard results, and thus, if an agent observed N previous contracts of which n were successfully fulfilled, then: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 and: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Note that as expected, the greater the number of contracts the agent observes, the smaller the variance term Var(p(o = 1)), and, thus, the less the uncertainty regarding the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1). 4. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TRUST We now extend the description above, to consider contracts between suppliers and agents that are represented by multiple dimensions, and hence the success or failure of a contract can be decomposed into the success or failure of each separate dimension. Consider again the example of the supply chain that specifies the timeliness, quantity, and quality of the goods that are to be delivered. Thus, within our trust model oa = 1 now indicates a successful outcome over dimension a of the contract and oa = 0 indicates an unsuccessful one. A contract outcome, X, is now composed of a vector of individual contract part outcomes (e.g. X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .}). Given a multi-dimensional contract whose outcome is described by the vector X, we again consider that in order for an agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract. To this end, we can make the general statement that the expected utility of a contract is given by: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) where p(X) is a joint probability distribution over all possible contract outcomes: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) and U(X) is the utility derived from these possible outcomes: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) As before, whilst U(X) is known to the agent, the probability distribution p(X) is not. Rather, given the agents direct experience of the supplier, the agent can determine a distribution over possible values for p(X). In the single dimensional case, a beta distribution was the natural choice over possible values of p(o = 1). In the multi-dimensional case, where p(X) itself is a vector of probabilities, the corresponding natural choice is the Dirichlet distribution, since this is a conjugate prior for multinomial proportions [3]. Given this distribution, the agent is then able to calculate an estimate of the expected utility of a contract. As before, this estimate is itself represented by an expected value given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) and a variance, describing the uncertainty in this expected utility: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) where: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Thus, whilst the single dimensional case naturally leads to a trust model in which the agents attempt to derive an estimate of probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1), along with a scalar variance that describes the uncertainty in this probability, Var(p(o = 1)), in this case, the agents must derive an estimate of a vector of probabilities, ˆp(X), along with a covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), that represents the uncertainty in p(X) given the observed contractual outcomes. At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract. However, in the multi-dimensional case the agent must determine ˆp(X), and since this describes the probability of all possible contract outcomes, including those that are completely un-fulfilled, this direct semantic interpretation is not present. In the next section, we describe the exemplar utility function that we shall use in the remainder of this paper. 4.1 Exemplar Utility Function The approach described so far is completely general, in that it applies to any utility function of the form described above, and also applies to the estimation of any joint probability distribution. In the remainder of this paper, for illustrative purposes, we shall limit the discussion to the simplest possible utility function that exhibits a dependence upon the correlations between the contract dimensions. That is, we consider the case that expected utility is dependent only on the marginal probabilities of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, rather than the full joint probabilities: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Thus, ˆp(X) is a vector estimate of the probability of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, and maintains the clear semantic interpretation seen in the single dimensional case: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) The correlations between the contract dimensions affect the uncertainty in the expected utility. To see this, consider the covariance 1072 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) matrix that describes this uncertainty, Cov(p(X)), is now given by: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . . Cab Vb Cbc . . . Cac Cbc Vc . . . ... ... ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (12) In this matrix, the diagonal terms, Va, Vb and Vc, represent the uncertainties in p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) and p(oc = 1) within p(X). The off-diagonal terms, Cab, Cac and Cbc, represent the correlations between these probabilities. In the next section, we use the Dirichlet distribution to calculate both ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) from an agents direct experience of previous contract outcomes. We first illustrate why this is necessary by considering an alternative approach to modelling multi-dimensional contracts whereby an agent na¨ıvely assumes that the dimensions are independent, and thus, it models each individually by separate beta distributions (as in the single dimensional case we presented in section 3). This is actually equivalent to setting the off-diagonal terms within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), to zero. However, doing so can lead an agent to assume that its estimate of the expected utility of the contract is more accurate than it actually is. To illustrate this, consider a specific scenario with the following values: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 and Va = Vb = 0.2. In this case, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), and thus, if the correlation Cab is ignored then the variance in the expected utility is 0.4. However, if the contract outcomes are completely correlated then Cab = 1 and Var(E[U]) is actually 0.8. Thus, in order to have an accurate estimate of the variance of the expected contract utility, and to make a rational decision, it is essential that the agent is able to represent and calculate these correlation terms. In the next section, we describe how an agent may do so using the Dirichlet distribution. 4.2 The Dirichlet Distribution In this section, we describe how the agent may use its direct experience of previous contracts, and the standard results of the Dirichlet distribution, to determine an estimate of the probability that each contract dimension will be successful fulfilled, ˆp(X), and a measure of the uncertainties in these probabilities that expresses the correlations between the contract dimensions, Cov(p(X)). We first consider the calculation of ˆp(X) and the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)). As described above, the derivation of these results is identical to the case of the single dimensional beta distribution, where out of N contract outcomes, n are successfully fulfilled. In the multi-dimensional case, however, we have a vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} that represents the number of outcomes for which each of the individual contract dimensions were successfully fulfilled. Thus, in terms of the standard Dirichlet parameters where αa = na + 1 and α0 = N + 2, the agent can estimate the probability of this contract dimension being successfully fulfilled: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 and can also calculate the variance in any contract dimension: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) However, calculating the off-diagonal terms within Cov(p(X)) is more complex since it is necessary to consider the correlations between the contract dimensions. Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j. For example, nab 10 represents the number of contracts for which oa = 1 and ob = 0. Now, using the standard Dirichlet notation, we can define αab ij nab ij + 1 for all i and j taking values 0 and 1, and then, to calculate the cross-correlations between contract pairs a and b, we note that the Dirichlet distribution over pair-wise joint probabilities is: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 where: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 and Kab is a normalising constant [3]. From this we can derive pair-wise probability estimates and variances: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) where: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) and in fact, α0 = N + 2, where N is the total number of contracts observed. Likewise, we can express the covariance in these pairwise probabilities in similar terms: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0) Finally, we can use the expression: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) to determine the covariance Cab. To do so, we first simplify the notation by defining V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] and Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)]. The covariance for the probability of positive contract outcomes is then the covariance between j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) and i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), and thus: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11 . Thus, given a set of contract outcomes that represent the agents previous interactions with a supplier, we may use the Dirichlet distribution to calculate the mean and variance of the probability of any contract dimension being successfully fulfilled (i.e. ˆp(oa = 1) and Va). In addition, by a somewhat more complex procedure we can also calculate the correlations between these probabilities (i.e. Cab). This allows us to calculate an estimate of the probability that any contract dimension will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(X), and also represent the uncertainty and correlations in these probabilities by the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)). In turn, these results may be used to calculate the estimate and uncertainty in the expected utility of the contract. In the next section we present empirical results that show that in practise this formalism yields significant improvements in these estimates compared to the na¨ıve approximation using multiple independent beta distributions. 4.3 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our formalism, and show the importance of the off-diagonal terms in Cov(p(X)), we compare two approaches: The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1073 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Correlation (ρ) Var(E[U]) Dirichlet Distribution Indepedent Beta Distributions −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Correlation (ρ) Information(I) Dirichlet Distribution Indepedent Beta Distributions Figure 1: Plots showing (i) the variance of the expected contract utility and (ii) the information content of the estimates computed using the Dirichlet distribution and multiple independent beta distributions. Results are averaged over 106 runs, and the error bars show the standard error in the mean. • Dirichlet Distribution: We use the full Dirichlet distribution, as described above, to calculate ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) including all its off-diagonal terms that represent the correlations between the contract dimensions. • Independent Beta Distributions: We use independent beta distributions to represent each contract dimension, in order to calculate ˆp(X), and then, as described earlier, we approximate Cov(p(X)) and ignore the correlations by setting all the off-diagonal terms to zero. We consider a two-dimensional case where u(oa = 1) = 6 and u(ob = 1) = 2, since this allows us to plot ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) as ellipses in a two-dimensional plane, and thus explain the differences between the two approaches. Specifically, we initially allocate the agent some previous contract outcomes that represents its direct experience with a supplier. The number of contracts is drawn uniformly between 10 and 20, and the actual contract outcomes are drawn from an arbitrary joint distribution intended to induce correlations between the contract dimensions. For each set of contracts, we use the approaches described above to calculate ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)), and hence, the variance in the expected contract utility, Var(E[U]). In addition, we calculate a scalar measure of the information content, I, of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)), which is a standard way of measuring the uncertainty encoded within the covariance matrix [1]. More specifically, we calculate the determinant of the inverse of the covariance matrix: I = det(Cov(p(X))−1 ) (16) and note that the larger the information content, the more precise ˆp(X) will be, and thus, the better the estimate of the expected utility that the agent is able to calculate. Finally, we use the results 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 p(o =1) p(o=1) a b Dirichlet Distribution Indepedent Beta Distributions Figure 2: Examples of ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) plotted as second standard error ellipses. presented in section 4.2 to calculate the actual correlation, ρ, associated with this particular set of contract outcomes: ρ = Cab √ VaVb (17) where Cab, Va and Vb are calculated as described in section 4.2. The results of this analysis are shown in figure 1. Here we show the values of I and Var(E[U]) calculated by the agents, plotted against the correlation of the contract outcomes, ρ, that constituted their direct experience. The results are averaged over 106 simulation runs. Note that as expected, when the dimensions of the contract outcomes are uncorrelated (i.e. ρ = 0), then both approaches give the same results. However, the value of using our formalism with the full Dirichlet distribution is shown when the correlation between the dimensions increases (either negatively or positively). As can be seen, if we approximate the Dirichlet distribution with multiple independent beta distributions, all of the correlation information contained within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), is lost, and thus, the information content of the matrix is much lower. The loss of this correlation information leads the variance of the expected utility of the contract to be incorrect (either over or under estimated depending on the correlation)5 , with the exact amount of mis-estimation depending on the actual utility function chosen (i.e. the values of u(oa = 1) and u(ob = 1)). In addition, in figure 2 we illustrate an example of the estimates calculated through both methods, for a single exemplar set of contract outcomes. We represent the probability estimates, ˆp(X), and the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), in the standard way as an ellipse [1]. That is, ˆp(X) determines the position of the center of the ellipse, Cov(p(X)) defines its size and shape. Note that whilst the ellipse resulting from the full Dirichlet formalism accurately reflects the true distribution (samples of which are plotted as points), that calculated by using multiple independent Beta distributions (and thus ignoring the correlations) results in a much larger ellipse that does not reflect the true distribution. The larger size of this ellipse is a result of the off-diagonal terms of the covariance matrix being set to zero, and corresponds to the agent miscalculating the uncertainty in the probability of each contract dimension being fulfilled. This, in turn, leads it to miscalculate the uncertainty in the expected utility of a contract (shown in figure 1 as Var(E[U]). 5. COMMUNICATING REPUTATION Having described how an individual agent can use its own direct experience of contract outcomes in order to estimate the probabil5 Note that the plots are not smooth due to the fact that given a limited number of contract outcomes, then the mean of Va and Vb do not vary smoothly with ρ. 1074 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) ity that a multi-dimensional contract will be successfully fulfilled, we now go on to consider how agents within an open multi-agent system can communicate these estimates to one another. This is commonly referred to as reputation and allows agents with limited direct experience of a supplier to make rational decisions. Both Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al. present models whereby reputation is communicated between agents using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution [6, 11]. This approach is attractive since these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of contracts observed, N, and the number of these that were successfully fulfilled, n). Under the probabilistic framework of the beta distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agents own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes. We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution. In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions). For instance, in the case of three dimensions, N, is given by: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information. Again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier. Finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here, by adopting the same principled approach as Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within this multi-dimensional model. However, we now go on to consider a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks. 6. RUMOUR PROPAGATION WITHIN REPUTATION SYSTEMS In the previous section, we described the use of sufficient statistics to communicate reputation, and we showed that by aggregating contract outcomes together into these sufficient statistics, a large number of contract outcomes can be represented and communicated in a compact form. Whilst, this is an attractive property, it can be problematic in practise, since the individual provenance of each contract outcome is lost in the aggregation. Thus, to ensure an accurate estimate, the reputation system must ensure that each observation of a contract outcome is included within the aggregated statistics no more than once. Within a centralised reputation system, where all agents report their direct experience to a trusted center, such double counting of contract outcomes is easy to avoid. However, in a decentralised reputation system, where agents communicate reputation to one another, and aggregate their direct experience with these reputation reports on-the-fly, avoiding double counting is much more difficult. a1 a2 a3 ¨ ¨¨ ¨¨ ¨¨B E T N1 N1 N1 + N2 Figure 3: Example of rumour propagation in a decentralised reputation system. For example, consider the case shown in figure 3 where three agents (a1 . . . a3), each with some direct experience of a supplier, share reputation reports regarding this supplier. If agent a1 were to provide its estimate to agents a2 and a3 in the form of the sufficient statistics of its Dirichlet distribution, then these agents can aggregate these contract outcomes with their own, and thus obtain more precise estimates. If at a later stage, agent a2 were to send its aggregate vector of contract outcomes to agent a3, then agent a3 being unaware of the full history of exchanges, may attempt to combine these contract outcomes with its own aggregated vector. However, since both vectors contain a contribution from agent a1, these will be counted twice in the final aggregated vector, and will result in a biased and overconfident estimate. This is termed rumour propagation or data incest in the data fusion literature [9]. One possible solution would be to uniquely identify the source of each contract outcome, and then propagate each vector, along with its label, through the network. Agents can thus identify identical observations that have arrived through different routes, and after removing the duplicates, can aggregate these together to form their estimates. Whilst this appears to be attractive in principle, for a number of reasons, it is not always a viable solution in practise [12]. Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage. As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with). Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system). Finally, it may actually be difficult to assign globally agreeable, consistent, and unique labels for each agent within an open system. In the next section, we develop a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems. Our solution is based on an approach developed within the area of target tracking and data fusion [9]. It avoids the need to uniquely identify an agent, it allows agents to restrict the number of other agents who they reveal their private estimates to, and yet it still allows information to propagate throughout the network. 6.1 Private and Shared Information Our solution to rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems introduces the notion of private information that an agent knows it has not communicated to any other agent, and shared information that has been communicated to, or received from, another agent. Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately. Both the origThe Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1075 inating and receiving agents then update their two vectors appropriately. To understand this, consider the case that agent aα sends its private and shared contract outcome vectors, Nα p and Nα s , to agent aβ that itself has private and shared contract outcomes Nβ p and Nβ s . Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private. Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes). It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s . Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate. Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate. If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector. This procedure has a number of attractive properties. Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided. However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network. Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases. Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours. If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information. Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents. Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents. Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3). At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions. We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section. That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes. At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience. In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience. In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates. We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent. This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network. However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns. Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution. The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4. Here we show the sum of the information content of each agents covariance matrix (calculated as discussed earlier in section 4.3), for each of these four different approaches. We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration. Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved. This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases. Next, we note that in the case of rumour propagation, the information content increases continually, and rapidly exceeds the centralised reputation result. The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events. Finally, we note that using private and shared information represents a compromise between the private information only case and the centralised reputation case. Information is still allowed to propagate around the network, however rumours are eliminated. As before, we also plot a single instance of the trust estimates from one agent (i.e. ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X))) as a set of ellipses on a 1076 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1 2 3 4 5 10 4 10 6 10 8 10 10 Iteration Information(I) Private & Shared Information Rumour Propagation Private Information Only Centralised Reputation Figure 4: Sum of information over all agents as a function of the communication iteration. two-dimensional plane (along with samples from the true distribution). As expected, the centralised reputation system achieves the best estimate of the true distribution, since it uses the direct experience of all agents. The private information only case shows the largest ellipse since it propagates the least information around the network. The rumour propagation case shows the smallest ellipse, but it is inconsistent with the actual distribution p(X). Thus, propagating rumours around the network and double counting contract outcomes in the belief that they are independent events, results in an overconfident estimate. However, we note that our solution, using separate vectors of private and shared information, allows us to propagate more information than the private information only case, but we completely avoid the problems of rumour propagation. Finally, we consider the effect that this has on the agents calculation of the expected utility of the contract. We assume the same utility function as used in section 4.3 (i.e. u(oa = 1) = 6 and u(ob = 1) = 2), and in table 1 we present the estimate of the expected utility, and its standard deviation calculated for all four cases by a single agent at iteration five (after communication has ceased to have any further effect for all methods other than rumour propagation). We note that the rumour propagation case is clearly inconsistent with the centralised reputation system, since its standard deviation is too small and does not reflect the true uncertainty in the expected utility, given the contract outcomes. However, we observe that our solution represents the closest case to the centralised reputation system, and thus succeeds in propagating information throughout the network, whilst also avoiding bias and overconfidence. The exact difference between it and the centralised reputation system depends upon the topology of the network, and the history of exchanges that take place within it. 7. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we addressed the need for a principled probabilistic model of computational trust that deals with contracts that have multiple correlated dimensions. Our starting point was an agent estimating the expected utility of a contract, and we showed that this leads to a model of computational trust that uses the Dirichlet distribution to calculate a trust estimate from the direct experience of an agent. We then showed how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to represent and communicate reputation within a decentralised reputation system, and we presented a solution to rumour propagation within these systems. Our future work in this area is to extend the exchange of reputation to the case where contracts are not homogeneous. That is, not all agents observe the same contract dimensions. This is a challenging extension, since in this case, the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution can not be used directly.

INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Él desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5]. Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión. Jøsang e Ismail describen el Sistema de Reputación Beta, en el cual la reputación de un agente se compila a partir de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6]. La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio fundamentado para representar la incertidumbre. Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluyen un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descontar las opiniones de agentes que tienen calificaciones de reputación bajas, y técnicas para manejar reputaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo. Asimismo, Teacy et al. utilizan la distribución beta para describir la creencia de un agente en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla exitosamente con sus compromisos [11]. Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad basándose en su experiencia directa, y nuevamente utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes. Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial, y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan con veracidad sus estimaciones de confianza. Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque basado en principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes. Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más fundamentados. Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato. En el caso unidimensional, esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.). Sin embargo, luego pasamos a extender este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, es decir, la distribución de Dirichlet, para representar la creencia de los agentes sobre múltiples dimensiones. 3. CONFIANZA UNIDIMENSIONAL Antes de presentar nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional, primero introducimos la notación y el formalismo que utilizaremos describiendo el caso más familiar unidimensional. Consideramos a un agente que debe decidir si comprometerse en un contrato futuro con un proveedor. Este contrato llevará a algún resultado, o, y consideramos que o = 1 si el contrato se cumple con éxito, y o = 0 si no. Para que el agente pueda tomar una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Suponemos que en caso de que el contrato se cumpla con éxito, el agente obtiene una utilidad u(o = 1), de lo contrario no recibe ninguna utilidad. Ahora, dado que el agente no está seguro de la fiabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá el contrato, debería considerar la utilidad esperada que obtendrá, E[U], y esto se da por: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) donde p(o = 1) es la probabilidad de que el proveedor cumpla exitosamente con el contrato. Sin embargo, aunque el agente conoce u(o = 1), no conoce p(o = 1). Lo mejor que el agente puede hacer es determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1) dados sus experiencias directas de resultados de contratos anteriores. Dado que ha sido capaz de hacerlo, puede entonces determinar una estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, E[E[U]], y una medida de su incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada, Var(E[U]). Esta incertidumbre es importante ya que un agente adverso al riesgo puede tomar una decisión con respecto a un contrato. Nota que solo consideramos resultados de contratos binarios, aunque extender esto a resultados parciales es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro. Claramente esto puede extenderse al caso en el que se derive cierta utilidad de un resultado no exitoso. Nota que esto a menudo se llama la utilidad esperada esperada, y esta es la notación que adoptamos aquí. El Sexto Internacional. La Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) no solo se basa en su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, sino también en la probabilidad de que la utilidad esperada supere cierta cantidad mínima. Estas dos propiedades se dan por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) donde ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) son la estimación y la incertidumbre de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, y se calculan a partir de la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) que el agente determina a partir de su experiencia directa. El enfoque basado en utilidad que presentamos aquí proporciona una motivación atractiva para este modelo de Teacy et al. [11]. Ahora, en el caso de resultados de contratos binarios, la distribución beta es la elección natural para representar la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) ya que dentro de la estadística bayesiana se sabe que es la distribución previa conjugada para observaciones binomiales [3]. Al adoptar la distribución beta, podemos calcular ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) utilizando resultados estándar, y así, si un agente observó N contratos anteriores de los cuales n se cumplieron con éxito, entonces: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 y: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Tenga en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuanto mayor sea el número de contratos que el agente observa, menor será el término de varianza Var(p(o = 1)), y, por lo tanto, menor será la incertidumbre con respecto a la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1). CONFIANZA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL Ahora extendemos la descripción anterior para considerar contratos entre proveedores y agentes que están representados por múltiples dimensiones, por lo que el éxito o fracaso de un contrato puede descomponerse en el éxito o fracaso de cada dimensión por separado. Considera nuevamente el ejemplo de la cadena de suministro que especifica la puntualidad, cantidad y calidad de los bienes que deben ser entregados. Por lo tanto, dentro de nuestro modelo de confianza, oa = 1 ahora indica un resultado exitoso sobre la dimensión a del contrato y oa = 0 indica uno no exitoso. Un resultado de contrato, X, está compuesto ahora por un vector de resultados de partes individuales del contrato (por ejemplo, X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . . }). Dado un contrato multidimensional cuyo resultado está descrito por el vector X, consideramos nuevamente que para que un agente tome una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Con este fin, podemos hacer la afirmación general de que la utilidad esperada de un contrato se da por: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) donde p(X) es una distribución conjunta de probabilidad sobre todos los posibles resultados del contrato: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) y U(X) es la utilidad derivada de estos posibles resultados: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) Como antes, mientras que U(X) es conocido por el agente, la distribución de probabilidad p(X) no lo es. Más bien, dada la experiencia directa de los agentes con el proveedor, el agente puede determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(X). En el caso unidimensional, una distribución beta fue la elección natural sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1). En el caso multi-dimensional, donde p(X) en sí mismo es un vector de probabilidades, la elección natural correspondiente es la distribución de Dirichlet, ya que esta es una distribución previa conjugada para proporciones multinomiales [3]. Dada esta distribución, el agente puede calcular una estimación de la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Como antes, esta estimación está representada por un valor esperado dado por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) y una varianza, que describe la incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) donde: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Así, mientras que el caso unidimensional naturalmente conduce a un modelo de confianza en el que los agentes intentan derivar una estimación de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1), junto con una varianza escalar que describe la incertidumbre en esta probabilidad, Var(p(o = 1)), en este caso, los agentes deben derivar una estimación de un vector de probabilidades, ˆp(X), junto con una matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), que representa la incertidumbre en p(X) dadas las consecuencias contractuales observadas. En este punto, es interesante notar que la estimación en el caso unidimensional, ˆp(o = 1), tiene un claro significado semántico en relación con la confianza; es la creencia de los agentes en la probabilidad de que un proveedor cumpla exitosamente un contrato. Sin embargo, en el caso multidimensional, el agente debe determinar ˆp(X), y dado que esto describe la probabilidad de todos los posibles resultados del contrato, incluidos aquellos que no se cumplen en absoluto, esta interpretación semántica directa no está presente. En la siguiente sección, describimos la función de utilidad ejemplar que utilizaremos en el resto de este documento. 4.1 Función de Utilidad Ejemplar El enfoque descrito hasta ahora es completamente general, ya que se aplica a cualquier función de utilidad del tipo descrito anteriormente, y también se aplica a la estimación de cualquier distribución de probabilidad conjunta. En el resto de este documento, con fines ilustrativos, limitaremos la discusión a la función de utilidad más simple posible que muestre una dependencia de las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Es decir, consideramos el caso en el que la utilidad esperada depende solo de las probabilidades marginales de que se cumpla exitosamente cada dimensión del contrato, en lugar de las probabilidades conjuntas completas: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Por lo tanto, ˆp(X) es una estimación vectorial de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se cumpla exitosamente, y mantiene la clara interpretación semántica vista en el caso unidimensional: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) Las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato afectan la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada. Para ver esto, considera la covarianza 1072 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. La matriz que describe esta incertidumbre, Cov(p(X)), en la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se da ahora por: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . . I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab Vb Cbc . . .\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for translation? En esta matriz, los términos diagonales, Va, Vb y Vc, representan las incertidumbres en p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) y p(oc = 1) dentro de p(X). Los términos fuera de la diagonal, Cab, Cac y Cbc, representan las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades. En la siguiente sección, utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular tanto ˆp(X) como Cov(p(X)) a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente en los resultados de contratos anteriores. Primero ilustramos por qué esto es necesario considerando un enfoque alternativo para modelar contratos multidimensionales, en el cual un agente asume ingenuamente que las dimensiones son independientes, y por lo tanto, modela cada una individualmente mediante distribuciones beta separadas (como en el caso unidimensional que presentamos en la sección 3). Esto es en realidad equivalente a establecer los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), a cero. Sin embargo, hacerlo puede llevar a un agente a asumir que su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato es más precisa de lo que en realidad es. Para ilustrar esto, considera un escenario específico con los siguientes valores: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 y Va = Vb = 0.2. En este caso, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), y por lo tanto, si se ignora la correlación Cab, la varianza en la utilidad esperada es de 0.4. Sin embargo, si los resultados del contrato están completamente correlacionados, entonces Cab = 1 y Var(E[U]) es en realidad 0.8. Por lo tanto, para tener una estimación precisa de la varianza de la utilidad del contrato esperada, y para tomar una decisión racional, es esencial que el agente sea capaz de representar y calcular estos términos de correlación. En la siguiente sección, describimos cómo un agente puede hacerlo utilizando la distribución de Dirichlet. 4.2 La Distribución de Dirichlet En esta sección, describimos cómo el agente puede utilizar su experiencia directa de contratos anteriores y los resultados estándar de la distribución de Dirichlet para determinar una estimación de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato sea cumplida exitosamente, ˆp(X), y una medida de las incertidumbres en estas probabilidades que expresa las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato, Cov(p(X)). Primero consideramos el cálculo de ˆp(X) y los términos diagonales de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)). Como se describe arriba, la derivación de estos resultados es idéntica al caso de la distribución beta unidimensional, donde de N resultados de contratos, n se cumplen exitosamente. En el caso multi-dimensional, sin embargo, tenemos un vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} que representa el número de resultados para los cuales se cumplieron con éxito cada una de las dimensiones individuales del contrato. Por lo tanto, en términos de los parámetros estándar de Dirichlet donde αa = na + 1 y α0 = N + 2, el agente puede estimar la probabilidad de que esta dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 y también puede calcular la varianza en cualquier dimensión del contrato: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Sin embargo, calcular los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de Cov(p(X)) es más complejo ya que es necesario considerar las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Por lo tanto, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), debemos considerar todas las posibles combinaciones de resultados de contrato, y así definimos nab ij como el número de resultados de contrato para los cuales tanto oa = i como ob = j. Por ejemplo, nab 10 representa el número de contratos para los cuales oa = 1 y ob = 0. Ahora, utilizando la notación estándar de Dirichlet, podemos definir αab ij nab ij + 1 para todos los i y j que toman valores 0 y 1, y luego, para calcular las correlaciones cruzadas entre los pares de contratos a y b, observamos que la distribución de Dirichlet sobre las probabilidades conjuntas par a par es: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 donde: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 y Kab es una constante de normalización [3]. A partir de esto podemos derivar estimaciones de probabilidad y varianzas por pares: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) donde: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) y de hecho, α0 = N + 2, donde N es el número total de contratos observados. Asimismo, podemos expresar la covarianza en estas probabilidades por pares en términos similares: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0). Finalmente, podemos utilizar la expresión: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) para determinar la covarianza Cab. Para hacerlo, primero simplificamos la notación definiendo V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] y Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)]. La covarianza para la probabilidad de resultados positivos de contrato es entonces la covarianza entre j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) e i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), y por lo tanto: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11. Por lo tanto, dado un conjunto de resultados de contratos que representan las interacciones previas de los agentes con un proveedor, podemos utilizar la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular la media y la varianza de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato (es decir, ˆp(oa = 1) y Va). Además, mediante un procedimiento algo más complejo también podemos calcular las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades (es decir, ... I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab).\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for me to translate to Spanish? Esto nos permite calcular una estimación de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato, ˆp(X), y también representar la incertidumbre y correlaciones en estas probabilidades mediante la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)). A su vez, estos resultados pueden ser utilizados para calcular la estimación y la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada del contrato. En la siguiente sección presentamos resultados empíricos que muestran que en la práctica este formalismo produce mejoras significativas en estas estimaciones en comparación con la aproximación ingenua que utiliza múltiples distribuciones beta independientes. Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de nuestro formalismo y mostrar la importancia de los términos fuera de la diagonal en Cov(p(X)), comparamos dos enfoques: La Sexta Conferencia Internacional.

Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones, y las barras de error muestran el error estándar en la media. • Distribución de Dirichlet: Utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet completa, como se describe arriba, para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), incluyendo todos sus términos fuera de la diagonal que representan las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. • Distribuciones Beta Independientes: Utilizamos distribuciones beta independientes para representar cada dimensión del contrato, con el fin de calcular ˆp(X), y luego, como se describió anteriormente, aproximamos Cov(p(X)) e ignoramos las correlaciones al establecer todos los términos fuera de la diagonal en cero. Consideramos un caso bidimensional donde u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2, ya que esto nos permite trazar ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) como elipses en un plano bidimensional, y así explicar las diferencias entre los dos enfoques. Específicamente, inicialmente asignamos al agente algunos resultados de contratos anteriores que representan su experiencia directa con un proveedor. El número de contratos se elige de forma uniforme entre 10 y 20, y los resultados reales de los contratos se eligen de una distribución conjunta arbitraria destinada a inducir correlaciones entre las dimensiones de los contratos. Para cada conjunto de contratos, utilizamos los enfoques descritos anteriormente para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), y por lo tanto, la varianza en la utilidad esperada del contrato, Var(E[U]). Además, calculamos una medida escalar del contenido de información, I, de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)), que es una forma estándar de medir la incertidumbre codificada dentro de la matriz de covarianza [1]. Más específicamente, calculamos el determinante de la inversa de la matriz de covarianza: I = det(Cov(p(X))−1 ) (16) y observamos que cuanto mayor sea el contenido de información, más precisa será ˆp(X), y por lo tanto, mejor será la estimación de la utilidad esperada que el agente puede calcular. Finalmente, utilizamos los resultados 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 p(o =1) p(o=1) a b Distribución de Dirichlet Distribuciones Beta Independientes Figura 2: Ejemplos de ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) representados como elipses de segundo error estándar. presentados en la sección 4.2 para calcular la correlación real, ρ, asociada con este conjunto particular de resultados de contrato: ρ = Cab √ VaVb (17) donde Cab, Va y Vb se calculan como se describe en la sección 4.2. Los resultados de este análisis se muestran en la figura 1. Aquí mostramos los valores de I y Var(E[U]) calculados por los agentes, representados en función de la correlación de los resultados del contrato, ρ, que constituyeron su experiencia directa. Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones de simulación. Se debe tener en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuando las dimensiones de los resultados del contrato no están correlacionadas (es decir, ρ = 0), ambos enfoques dan los mismos resultados. Sin embargo, el valor de utilizar nuestro formalismo con la distribución de Dirichlet completa se muestra cuando la correlación entre las dimensiones aumenta (ya sea de forma negativa o positiva). Como se puede observar, si aproximamos la distribución de Dirichlet con múltiples distribuciones beta independientes, toda la información de correlación contenida en la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), se pierde, y por lo tanto, el contenido informativo de la matriz es mucho menor. La pérdida de esta información de correlación hace que la varianza de la utilidad esperada del contrato sea incorrecta (ya sea sobreestimada o subestimada dependiendo de la correlación), con la cantidad exacta de subestimación dependiendo de la función de utilidad real elegida (es decir, los valores de u(oa = 1) y u(ob = 1)). Además, en la figura 2 ilustramos un ejemplo de las estimaciones calculadas a través de ambos métodos, para un único conjunto de resultados de contratos. Representamos las estimaciones de probabilidad, ˆp(X), y la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), de la manera estándar como una elipse [1]. Es decir, ˆp(X) determina la posición del centro de la elipse, Cov(p(X)) define su tamaño y forma. Cabe destacar que si bien la elipse resultante del formalismo completo de Dirichlet refleja con precisión la verdadera distribución (cuyas muestras se representan como puntos), la calculada al utilizar múltiples distribuciones Beta independientes (y por lo tanto ignorando las correlaciones) resulta en una elipse mucho más grande que no refleja la verdadera distribución. El tamaño más grande de esta elipse es resultado de que los términos fuera de la diagonal de la matriz de covarianza se establecieron en cero, y corresponde a que el agente calculó erróneamente la incertidumbre en la probabilidad de que se cumpla cada dimensión del contrato. Esto, a su vez, hace que se calcule de forma incorrecta la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada de un contrato (mostrada en la figura 1 como Var(E[U]). 5. COMUNICANDO REPUTACIÓN Habiendo descrito cómo un agente individual puede utilizar su propia experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para estimar la probabilidad. Nota que las gráficas no son suaves debido al hecho de que, dado un número limitado de resultados de contratos, la media de Va y Vb no varía suavemente con ρ. 1074 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), ahora pasamos a considerar cómo los agentes dentro de un sistema multiagente abierto pueden comunicar estas estimaciones entre sí. Esto se conoce comúnmente como reputación y permite a los agentes con experiencia directa limitada de un proveedor tomar decisiones racionales. Tanto Jøsang e Ismail, como Teacy y colaboradores, presentan modelos en los que la reputación se comunica entre agentes utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta [6, 11]. Este enfoque es atractivo ya que estas estadísticas suficientes son simples agregaciones de los resultados de los contratos (más precisamente, simplemente son el número total de contratos observados, N, y el número de estos que se cumplieron exitosamente, n). Bajo el marco probabilístico de la distribución beta, los informes de reputación en esta forma simplemente pueden ser agregados con la propia experiencia directa de un agente, con el fin de obtener una estimación más precisa basada en un conjunto más amplio de resultados de contratos. Podemos extender inmediatamente este enfoque al caso multidimensional considerado aquí, al requerir que los agentes intercambien las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet en lugar de la distribución beta. En este caso, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), los agentes deben comunicar un vector de resultados de contrato, N, que son las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet, dadas por: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Por lo tanto, un agente puede comunicar las estadísticas suficientes de su propia distribución de Dirichlet en términos de solo 2d(d − 1) números (donde d es el número de dimensiones de contrato). Por ejemplo, en el caso de tres dimensiones, N, se da por: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > y, por lo tanto, conjuntos grandes de resultados de contratos pueden ser comunicados dentro de un tamaño de mensaje relativamente pequeño, sin pérdida de información. Una vez más, los agentes que reciben estas estadísticas suficientes pueden simplemente agregarlas a su propia experiencia directa para obtener una estimación más precisa de la confiabilidad de un proveedor. Finalmente, cabe destacar que si bien no es el enfoque de nuestro trabajo aquí, al adoptar el mismo enfoque basado en principios que Jøsang e Ismail, y Teacy y otros, muchas de las técnicas que han desarrollado (como descontar informes de agentes no confiables y filtrar informes inconsistentes de agentes egoístas) pueden aplicarse directamente dentro de este modelo multidimensional. Sin embargo, ahora pasamos a considerar un nuevo problema que surge tanto en los modelos unidimensionales como multidimensionales, a saber, los problemas que surgen cuando dichas estadísticas suficientes agregadas se propagan dentro de redes de agentes descentralizados. 6. PROPAGACIÓN DE RUMORES DENTRO DE SISTEMAS DE REPUTACIÓN En la sección anterior, describimos el uso de estadísticas suficientes para comunicar la reputación, y demostramos que al agregar los resultados de los contratos en estas estadísticas suficientes, se puede representar y comunicar un gran número de resultados de contratos de forma compacta. Si bien esta es una propiedad atractiva, puede ser problemática en la práctica, ya que la procedencia individual de cada resultado de contrato se pierde en la agregación. Por lo tanto, para garantizar una estimación precisa, el sistema de reputación debe asegurarse de que cada observación de un resultado de contrato se incluya en las estadísticas agregadas no más de una vez. Dentro de un sistema de reputación centralizado, donde todos los agentes informan sus experiencias directas a un centro de confianza, es fácil evitar el doble conteo de resultados de contratos. Sin embargo, en un sistema de reputación descentralizado, donde los agentes comunican la reputación entre sí y agregan su experiencia directa con estos informes de reputación sobre la marcha, evitar el doble conteo es mucho más difícil. Por ejemplo, considera el caso mostrado en la figura 3 donde tres agentes (a1 . . . a3), cada uno con cierta experiencia directa de un proveedor, comparten informes de reputación sobre este proveedor. Si el agente a1 proporcionara su estimación a los agentes a2 y a3 en forma de las estadísticas suficientes de su distribución de Dirichlet, entonces estos agentes pueden agregar estos resultados contractuales con los suyos propios, y así obtener estimaciones más precisas. Si en una etapa posterior, el agente a2 enviara su vector agregado de resultados de contratos al agente a3, entonces el agente a3, al no estar al tanto de toda la historia de intercambios, podría intentar combinar estos resultados de contratos con su propio vector agregado. Sin embargo, dado que ambos vectores contienen una contribución del agente a1, estos serán contados dos veces en el vector agregado final, lo que resultará en una estimación sesgada y excesivamente confiada. Esto se denomina propagación de rumores o incesto de datos en la literatura de fusión de datos [9]. Una posible solución sería identificar de manera única la fuente de cada resultado de contrato, y luego propagar cada vector, junto con su etiqueta, a través de la red. Los agentes pueden identificar así observaciones idénticas que han llegado por diferentes rutas, y después de eliminar los duplicados, pueden agregarlos juntos para formar sus estimaciones. Si bien esto parece atractivo en principio, por varias razones, no siempre es una solución viable en la práctica [12]. En primer lugar, los agentes pueden no desear que sus resultados de contrato etiquetados de manera única se compartan en un sistema abierto, ya que dicha información puede tener importancia comercial o práctica que podría ser utilizada en su contra. Por lo tanto, es posible que los agentes solo estén dispuestos a intercambiar resultados de contratos identificables con un pequeño número de otros agentes (quizás aquellos con los que tengan algún tipo de relación recíproca). En segundo lugar, el hecho de que no haya una agregación de los resultados del contrato a medida que circulan por la red significa que el tamaño del mensaje aumenta con el tiempo, y el tamaño final de estos mensajes está limitado únicamente por el número de agentes dentro del sistema (posiblemente un número extremadamente grande para un sistema global). Finalmente, puede resultar realmente difícil asignar etiquetas globalmente aceptables, consistentes y únicas para cada agente dentro de un sistema abierto. En la siguiente sección, desarrollamos una solución novedosa al problema de la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Nuestra solución se basa en un enfoque desarrollado dentro del área de seguimiento de objetivos y fusión de datos [9]. Evita la necesidad de identificar de forma única a un agente, permite a los agentes restringir la cantidad de otros agentes a los que revelan sus estimaciones privadas, y aún así permite que la información se propague por toda la red. 6.1 Información Privada y Compartida Nuestra solución para la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados introduce la noción de información privada que un agente sabe que no ha comunicado a ningún otro agente, y de información compartida que ha sido comunicada a, o recibida de, otro agente. Por lo tanto, el agente puede descomponer su vector de resultado de contrato, N, en dos vectores, uno privado, Np, que no ha sido comunicado a otro agente, y uno compartido, Ns, que ha sido compartido con, o recibido de, otro agente: N = Np + Ns (19). Ahora, cada vez que un agente comunica la reputación, comunica ambos vectores privados y compartidos por separado. Ambos el origEl Sexto Intl. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), los agentes emisores y receptores actualizan sus dos vectores de manera apropiada. Para entender esto, considera el caso en el que el agente aα envía sus vectores de resultados de contrato privados y compartidos, Nα p y Nα s, al agente aβ que a su vez tiene resultados de contrato privados y compartidos Nβ p y Nβ s. Cada agente actualiza sus vectores de resultados de contrato de acuerdo con el siguiente procedimiento: • Agente de origen: Una vez que el agente de origen ha enviado tanto sus vectores de resultados de contrato compartidos como privados a otro agente, su información privada ya no es privada. Por lo tanto, debe eliminar los resultados de contrato que estaban en su vector privado y agregarlos a su vector compartido: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Agente Receptor: El objetivo del agente receptor es acumular el mayor número de resultados de contrato (ya que esto resultará en la estimación más precisa) sin incluir información compartida tanto de sí mismo como del otro agente (ya que esto podría resultar en la duplicación de resultados de contrato). Tiene dos opciones dependiendo del número total de resultados de contrato dentro de su propio vector compartido, Nβ s , y dentro del del agente de origen, Nα s. Así, actualiza su vector de acuerdo con el procedimiento siguiente: - Nβ s > Nα s: Si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un mayor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente combina su vector compartido con el vector privado del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. - Nβ s < Nα s: Alternativamente, si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un menor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente receptor descarta su propio vector compartido y forma uno nuevo a partir de los vectores privado y compartido del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. En caso de que Nβ s = Nα s, entonces cualquiera de las opciones es apropiada. Una vez que el agente receptor ha actualizado sus conjuntos, utiliza los resultados del contrato en ambos para formar su estimación de confianza. Si los agentes reciben varios vectores simultáneamente, este enfoque se generaliza al agente receptor utilizando el vector compartido más grande, y los vectores privados de sí mismo y de todos los agentes originales para formar su nuevo vector compartido. Este procedimiento tiene varias propiedades atractivas. En primer lugar, dado que los resultados de los contratos en un vector compartido de agentes nunca se combinan con los de otro agente en el vector compartido, los resultados que provienen del mismo agente nunca se combinan entre sí, y por lo tanto, la propagación de rumores se evita por completo. Sin embargo, dado que el agente receptor puede descartar su propio vector compartido y adoptar el vector compartido del agente de origen, la información sigue propagándose por la red. Además, dado que los resultados de los contratos se agregan juntos dentro de los vectores privados y compartidos, el tamaño del mensaje es constante y no aumenta a medida que aumenta el número de interacciones. Finalmente, un agente solo comunica los resultados de su propio contrato privado a sus vecinos inmediatos. Si este agente 6 lo transmite posteriormente, lo hace como información agregada no identificable dentro de su información compartida. Por lo tanto, un agente puede limitar el número de agentes con los que está dispuesto a revelar resultados de contratos identificables, y sin embargo, estos resultados de contratos aún pueden propagarse dentro de la red, y así mejorar las estimaciones de otros agentes. A continuación, demostramos empíricamente que estas propiedades pueden ser realizadas en la práctica. 6.2 Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de este procedimiento, simulamos redes aleatorias compuestas por diez agentes. Cada agente tiene cierta experiencia directa de interactuar con un proveedor (como se describe en la sección 4.3). En cada iteración de la simulación, interactúa con sus vecinos inmediatos y intercambia informes de reputación a través de las estadísticas suficientes de sus distribuciones de Dirichlet. Comparamos nuestra solución con dos de las alternativas descentralizadas más obvias: • Información Privada y Compartida: Los agentes siguen el procedimiento descrito en la sección anterior. Es decir, mantienen vectores separados privados y compartidos de resultados de contrato, y en cada iteración comunican ambos vectores a sus vecinos inmediatos. • Propagación de rumores: Los agentes no diferencian entre resultados de contrato privados y compartidos. En la primera iteración comunican todos los resultados del contrato que constituyen su experiencia directa. En iteraciones posteriores, propagan los resultados de los contratos que reciben de cualquiera de los vecinos a todos sus otros vecinos inmediatos. • Solo Información Privada: Los agentes solo comunican los resultados de los contratos que constituyen su experiencia directa. En todos los casos, en cada iteración, los agentes utilizan la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular sus estimaciones de confianza. Comparamos estos tres enfoques descentralizados con un sistema de reputación centralizado: • Reputación Centralizada: Todos los agentes transmiten su experiencia directa a un sistema de reputación centralizado que las agrega y devuelve esta estimación a cada agente. Esta solución centralizada hace el uso más efectivo de la información disponible en la red. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los problemas del mundo real requieren soluciones descentralizadas debido a preocupaciones de escalabilidad, modularidad y comunicación. Por lo tanto, esta solución centralizada se incluye ya que representa el caso óptimo, y nos permite comparar nuestra solución descentralizada. Los resultados de estas comparaciones se muestran en la figura 4. Aquí mostramos la suma del contenido de información de la matriz de covarianza de cada agente (calculada como se discutió anteriormente en la sección 4.3), para cada uno de estos cuatro enfoques diferentes. Primero observamos que cuando solo se comunica información privada, no hay cambio en la información después de la primera iteración. Una vez que cada agente ha recibido la experiencia directa de sus vecinos inmediatos, no se puede lograr un aumento adicional en la información. Esto representa la comunicación mínima y exhibe la menor cantidad total de información de los cuatro casos. A continuación, observamos que en el caso de la propagación de rumores, el contenido de la información aumenta continuamente y supera rápidamente el resultado de la reputación centralizada. El hecho de que el caso de propagación de rumores exceda incorrectamente este límite indica que está contando continuamente los mismos resultados de contrato a medida que circulan por la red, creyendo que son eventos independientes. Finalmente, observamos que el uso de información privada y compartida representa un compromiso entre el caso de solo información privada y el caso de reputación centralizada. La información todavía se permite propagar por la red, sin embargo los rumores son eliminados. Como antes, también representamos una única instancia de las estimaciones de confianza de un agente (es decir, ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X))) como un conjunto de elipses en un 1076 The Sixth Intl.

Como era de esperar, el sistema de reputación centralizado logra la mejor estimación de la distribución real, ya que utiliza la experiencia directa de todos los agentes. El caso de información privada muestra la elipse más grande ya que propaga la menor cantidad de información alrededor de la red. El caso de propagación de rumores muestra la elipse más pequeña, pero es inconsistente con la distribución real p(X). Por lo tanto, propagar rumores en la red y contar dos veces los resultados de los contratos creyendo que son eventos independientes, resulta en una estimación excesivamente confiada. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución, utilizando vectores separados de información privada y compartida, nos permite propagar más información que en el caso de solo información privada, pero evitamos por completo los problemas de propagación de rumores. Finalmente, consideramos el efecto que esto tiene en el cálculo del valor esperado de utilidad del contrato por parte de los agentes. Suponemos la misma función de utilidad que se utilizó en la sección 4.3 (es decir, u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2), y en la tabla 1 presentamos la estimación de la utilidad esperada y su desviación estándar calculada para los cuatro casos por un único agente en la quinta iteración (después de que la comunicación haya dejado de tener efecto adicional para todos los métodos excepto la propagación de rumores). Observamos que el caso de propagación de rumores es claramente inconsistente con el sistema de reputación centralizado, ya que su desviación estándar es demasiado pequeña y no refleja la verdadera incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada, dadas las consecuencias del contrato. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución representa el caso más cercano al sistema de reputación centralizado, y por lo tanto logra propagar la información a lo largo de la red, evitando al mismo tiempo el sesgo y la sobreconfianza. La diferencia exacta entre esto y el sistema de reputación centralizado depende de la topología de la red y de la historia de intercambios que tienen lugar dentro de ella. 7. CONCLUSIONES En este artículo abordamos la necesidad de un modelo probabilístico fundamentado de confianza computacional que maneje contratos con múltiples dimensiones correlacionadas. Nuestro punto de partida fue un agente que estimaba la utilidad esperada de un contrato, y demostramos que esto conduce a un modelo de confianza computacional que utiliza la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular una estimación de confianza a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente. Luego mostramos cómo los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para representar y comunicar la reputación dentro de un sistema de reputación descentralizado, y presentamos una solución a la propagación de rumores dentro de estos sistemas. Nuestro trabajo futuro en esta área es extender el intercambio de reputación al caso en el que los contratos no son homogéneos. Es decir, no todos los agentes observan las mismas dimensiones del contrato. Esta es una extensión desafiante, ya que en este caso, las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet no pueden ser utilizadas directamente.

        "{reece,sjrob}@robots.ox.ac.uk 2 Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK. {acr,nrj}@ecs.soton.ac.uk ABSTRACT In this paper we develop a novel probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",
        "Our starting point is to consider an agent attempting to estimate the utility of a contract, and we show that this leads to a model of computational trust whereby an agent must determine a vector of estimates that represent the probability that any dimension of the contract will be successfully fulfilled, and a covariance matrix that describes the uncertainty and correlations in these probabilities.",
        "We present a formalism based on the Dirichlet distribution that allows an agent to calculate these probabilities and correlations from their direct experience of contract outcomes, and we show that this leads to superior estimates compared to an alternative approach using multiple independent beta distributions.",
        "We then show how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to communicate and fuse reputation within a decentralised reputation system.",
        "Finally, we present a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within such systems.",
        "This solution uses the notion of private and shared information, and provides estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding bias and overconfidence.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Intelligent agents General Terms Algorithms, Design, Theory 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION The role of computational models of trust within multi-agent systems in particular, and open distributed systems in general, has recently generated a great deal of research interest.",
        "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
        "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
        "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
        "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
        "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
        "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
        "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
        "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
        "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
        "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
        "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
        "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
        "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",
        "To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",
        "The starting point for our work is to consider how an agent can estimate the utility that it will derive from interacting with a supplier.",
        "Here we use standard approaches from the literature of data fusion (since this is a well developed field where the notion of multi-dimensional correlated estimates is well established1 ) to show that this naturally leads to a trust model where the agent must estimate probabilities and correlations over 1 In this context, the multiple dimensions typically represent the physical coordinates of a target being tracked, and correlations arise through the operation and orientation of sensors. 1070 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS multiple dimensions.",
        "Building upon this, we then devise a novel trust model that addresses the three desiderata discussed above.",
        "In more detail, in this paper we extend the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
        "We devise a novel multi-dimensional probabilistic trust model that enables an agent to estimate the expected utility of a contract, by estimating (i) the probability that each contract dimension will be successfully fulfilled, and (ii) the correlations between these estimates. 2.",
        "We present an exact probabilistic model based upon the Dirichlet distribution that allows agents to use their direct experience of contract outcomes to calculate the probabilities and correlations described above.",
        "We then benchmark this solution and show that it leads to good estimates. 3.",
        "We show that agents can use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution in order to exchange reputation reports with one another.",
        "The sufficient statistics represent aggregations of their direct experience, and thus, express contract outcomes in a compact format with no loss of information. 4.",
        "We show that, while being efficient, the aggregation of contract outcomes can lead to double counting, and rumour propagation, in decentralised reputation systems.",
        "Thus, we present a novel solution based upon the idea of private and shared information.",
        "We show that it yields estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding overconfidence.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: in section 2 we review related work.",
        "In section 3 we present our notation for a single dimensional contract, before introducing our multi-dimensional trust model in section 4.",
        "In sections 5 and 6 we discuss communicating reputation, and present our solution to rumour propagation in decentralised reputation systems.",
        "We conclude in section 7. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK The need for a multi-dimensional trust model has been recognised by a number of researchers.",
        "Sabater and Sierra present a model of reputation, in which agents form contracts based on multiple variables (such as delivery date and quality), and define impressions as subjective evaluations of the outcome of these contracts.",
        "They provide heuristic approaches to combining these impressions to form a measure they call subjective reputation.",
        "Likewise, Griffiths decomposes overall trust into a number of different dimensions such as success, cost, timeliness and quality [4].",
        "In his case, each dimension is scored as a real number that represents a comparative value with no strong semantic meaning.",
        "He develops an heuristic rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers.",
        "Whilst, he comments that the trust values could have some associated confidence level, heuristics for updating these levels are not presented.",
        "Gujral et al. take a similar approach and present a trust model over multiple domain specific dimensions [5].",
        "They define multidimensional goal requirements, and evaluate an expected payoff based on a suppliers estimated behaviour.",
        "These estimates are, however, simple aggregations over the direct experience of several agents, and there is no measure of the uncertainty.",
        "Nevertheless, they show that agents who select suppliers based on these multiple dimensions outperform those who consider just a single one.",
        "By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension.",
        "Jøsang and Ismail describe the Beta Reputation System whereby the reputation of an agent is compiled from the positive and negative reports from other agents who have interacted with it [6].",
        "The beta distribution represents a natural choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a principled means of representing uncertainty.",
        "Moreover, they provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques to deal with reputations that may change over time.",
        "Likewise, Teacy et al. use the beta distribution to describe an agents belief in the probability that another agent will successfully fulfill its commitments [11].",
        "They present a formalism using a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other agents.",
        "They provide a number of extensions to this initial model, and, in particular, they consider that agents may not always truthfully report their trust estimates.",
        "Thus, they present a principled approach to detecting and removing inconsistent reports.",
        "Our work builds upon these more principled approaches.",
        "However, the starting point of our approach is to consider an agent that is attempting to estimate the expected utility of a contract.",
        "We show that estimating this expected utility requires that an agent must estimate the probability with which the supplier will fulfill its contract.",
        "In the single-dimensional case, this naturally leads to a trust model using the beta distribution (as per Jøsang and Ismail and Teacy et al.).",
        "However, we then go on to extend this analysis to multiple dimensions, where we use the natural extension of the beta distribution, namely the Dirichlet distribution, to represent the agents belief over multiple dimensions. 3.",
        "SINGLE-DIMENSIONAL TRUST Before presenting our multi-dimensional trust model, we first introduce the notation and formalism that we will use by describing the more familiar single dimensional case.",
        "We consider an agent who must decide whether to engage in a future contract with a supplier.",
        "This contract will lead to some outcome, o, and we consider that o = 1 if the contract is successfully fulfilled, and o = 0 if not2 .",
        "In order for the agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract.",
        "We assume that in the case that the contract is successfully fulfilled, the agent derives a utility u(o = 1), otherwise it receives no utility3 .",
        "Now, given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the supplier will fulfill the contract, it should consider the expected utility that it will derive, E[U], and this is given by: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) where p(o = 1) is the probability that the supplier will successfully fulfill the contract.",
        "However, whilst u(o = 1) is known by the agent, p(o = 1) is not.",
        "The best the agent can do is to determine a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct experience of previous contract outcomes.",
        "Given that it has been able to do so, it can then determine an estimate of the expected utility4 of the contract, E[E[U]], and a measure of its uncertainty in this expected utility, Var(E[U]).",
        "This uncertainty is important since a risk averse agent may make a decision regarding a contract, 2 Note that we only consider binary contract outcomes, although extending this to partial outcomes is part of our future work. 3 Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is derived from an unsuccessful outcome. 4 Note that this is often called the expected expected utility, and this is the notation that we adopt here [2].",

        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1071 not only on its estimate of the expected utility of the contract, but also on the probability that the expected utility will exceed some minimum amount.",
        "These two properties are given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) where ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) are the estimate and uncertainty of the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, and are calculated from the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) that the agent determines from its direct experience.",
        "The utility based approach that we present here provides an attractive motivation for this model of Teacy et al. [11].",
        "Now, in the case of binary contract outcomes, the beta distribution is the natural choice to represent the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) since within Bayesian statistics this well known to be the conjugate prior for binomial observations [3].",
        "By adopting the beta distribution, we can calculate ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) using standard results, and thus, if an agent observed N previous contracts of which n were successfully fulfilled, then: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 and: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Note that as expected, the greater the number of contracts the agent observes, the smaller the variance term Var(p(o = 1)), and, thus, the less the uncertainty regarding the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1). 4.",
        "MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TRUST We now extend the description above, to consider contracts between suppliers and agents that are represented by multiple dimensions, and hence the success or failure of a contract can be decomposed into the success or failure of each separate dimension.",
        "Consider again the example of the supply chain that specifies the timeliness, quantity, and quality of the goods that are to be delivered.",
        "Thus, within our trust model oa = 1 now indicates a successful outcome over dimension a of the contract and oa = 0 indicates an unsuccessful one.",
        "A contract outcome, X, is now composed of a vector of individual contract part outcomes (e.g.",
        "X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . . }).",
        "Given a multi-dimensional contract whose outcome is described by the vector X, we again consider that in order for an agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract.",
        "To this end, we can make the general statement that the expected utility of a contract is given by: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) where p(X) is a joint probability distribution over all possible contract outcomes: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) and U(X) is the utility derived from these possible outcomes: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) As before, whilst U(X) is known to the agent, the probability distribution p(X) is not.",
        "Rather, given the agents direct experience of the supplier, the agent can determine a distribution over possible values for p(X).",
        "In the single dimensional case, a beta distribution was the natural choice over possible values of p(o = 1).",
        "In the multi-dimensional case, where p(X) itself is a vector of probabilities, the corresponding natural choice is the Dirichlet distribution, since this is a conjugate prior for multinomial proportions [3].",
        "Given this distribution, the agent is then able to calculate an estimate of the expected utility of a contract.",
        "As before, this estimate is itself represented by an expected value given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) and a variance, describing the uncertainty in this expected utility: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) where: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Thus, whilst the single dimensional case naturally leads to a trust model in which the agents attempt to derive an estimate of probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1), along with a scalar variance that describes the uncertainty in this probability, Var(p(o = 1)), in this case, the agents must derive an estimate of a vector of probabilities, ˆp(X), along with a covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), that represents the uncertainty in p(X) given the observed contractual outcomes.",
        "At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract.",
        "However, in the multi-dimensional case the agent must determine ˆp(X), and since this describes the probability of all possible contract outcomes, including those that are completely un-fulfilled, this direct semantic interpretation is not present.",
        "In the next section, we describe the exemplar utility function that we shall use in the remainder of this paper. 4.1 Exemplar Utility Function The approach described so far is completely general, in that it applies to any utility function of the form described above, and also applies to the estimation of any joint probability distribution.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, for illustrative purposes, we shall limit the discussion to the simplest possible utility function that exhibits a dependence upon the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
        "That is, we consider the case that expected utility is dependent only on the marginal probabilities of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, rather than the full joint probabilities: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Thus, ˆp(X) is a vector estimate of the probability of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, and maintains the clear semantic interpretation seen in the single dimensional case: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) The correlations between the contract dimensions affect the uncertainty in the expected utility.",
        "To see this, consider the covariance 1072 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) matrix that describes this uncertainty, Cov(p(X)), is now given by: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . .",
        "Cab Vb Cbc . . .",
        "Cac Cbc Vc . . . ... ... ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (12) In this matrix, the diagonal terms, Va, Vb and Vc, represent the uncertainties in p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) and p(oc = 1) within p(X).",
        "The off-diagonal terms, Cab, Cac and Cbc, represent the correlations between these probabilities.",
        "In the next section, we use the Dirichlet distribution to calculate both ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) from an agents direct experience of previous contract outcomes.",
        "We first illustrate why this is necessary by considering an alternative approach to modelling multi-dimensional contracts whereby an agent na¨ıvely assumes that the dimensions are independent, and thus, it models each individually by separate beta distributions (as in the single dimensional case we presented in section 3).",
        "This is actually equivalent to setting the off-diagonal terms within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), to zero.",
        "However, doing so can lead an agent to assume that its estimate of the expected utility of the contract is more accurate than it actually is.",
        "To illustrate this, consider a specific scenario with the following values: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 and Va = Vb = 0.2.",
        "In this case, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), and thus, if the correlation Cab is ignored then the variance in the expected utility is 0.4.",
        "However, if the contract outcomes are completely correlated then Cab = 1 and Var(E[U]) is actually 0.8.",
        "Thus, in order to have an accurate estimate of the variance of the expected contract utility, and to make a rational decision, it is essential that the agent is able to represent and calculate these correlation terms.",
        "In the next section, we describe how an agent may do so using the Dirichlet distribution. 4.2 The Dirichlet Distribution In this section, we describe how the agent may use its direct experience of previous contracts, and the standard results of the Dirichlet distribution, to determine an estimate of the probability that each contract dimension will be successful fulfilled, ˆp(X), and a measure of the uncertainties in these probabilities that expresses the correlations between the contract dimensions, Cov(p(X)).",
        "We first consider the calculation of ˆp(X) and the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)).",
        "As described above, the derivation of these results is identical to the case of the single dimensional beta distribution, where out of N contract outcomes, n are successfully fulfilled.",
        "In the multi-dimensional case, however, we have a vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} that represents the number of outcomes for which each of the individual contract dimensions were successfully fulfilled.",
        "Thus, in terms of the standard Dirichlet parameters where αa = na + 1 and α0 = N + 2, the agent can estimate the probability of this contract dimension being successfully fulfilled: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 and can also calculate the variance in any contract dimension: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) However, calculating the off-diagonal terms within Cov(p(X)) is more complex since it is necessary to consider the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
        "Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j.",
        "For example, nab 10 represents the number of contracts for which oa = 1 and ob = 0.",
        "Now, using the standard Dirichlet notation, we can define αab ij nab ij + 1 for all i and j taking values 0 and 1, and then, to calculate the cross-correlations between contract pairs a and b, we note that the Dirichlet distribution over pair-wise joint probabilities is: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 where: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 and Kab is a normalising constant [3].",
        "From this we can derive pair-wise probability estimates and variances: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) where: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) and in fact, α0 = N + 2, where N is the total number of contracts observed.",
        "Likewise, we can express the covariance in these pairwise probabilities in similar terms: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0) Finally, we can use the expression: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) to determine the covariance Cab.",
        "To do so, we first simplify the notation by defining V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] and Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)].",
        "The covariance for the probability of positive contract outcomes is then the covariance between j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) and i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), and thus: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11 .",
        "Thus, given a set of contract outcomes that represent the agents previous interactions with a supplier, we may use the Dirichlet distribution to calculate the mean and variance of the probability of any contract dimension being successfully fulfilled (i.e. ˆp(oa = 1) and Va).",
        "In addition, by a somewhat more complex procedure we can also calculate the correlations between these probabilities (i.e.",
        "Cab).",
        "This allows us to calculate an estimate of the probability that any contract dimension will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(X), and also represent the uncertainty and correlations in these probabilities by the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)).",
        "In turn, these results may be used to calculate the estimate and uncertainty in the expected utility of the contract.",
        "In the next section we present empirical results that show that in practise this formalism yields significant improvements in these estimates compared to the na¨ıve approximation using multiple independent beta distributions. 4.3 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our formalism, and show the importance of the off-diagonal terms in Cov(p(X)), we compare two approaches: The Sixth Intl.",

        "We consider a two-dimensional case where u(oa = 1) = 6 and u(ob = 1) = 2, since this allows us to plot ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) as ellipses in a two-dimensional plane, and thus explain the differences between the two approaches.",
        "Specifically, we initially allocate the agent some previous contract outcomes that represents its direct experience with a supplier.",
        "The number of contracts is drawn uniformly between 10 and 20, and the actual contract outcomes are drawn from an arbitrary joint distribution intended to induce correlations between the contract dimensions.",
        "For each set of contracts, we use the approaches described above to calculate ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)), and hence, the variance in the expected contract utility, Var(E[U]).",
        "In addition, we calculate a scalar measure of the information content, I, of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)), which is a standard way of measuring the uncertainty encoded within the covariance matrix [1].",

        "The results of this analysis are shown in figure 1.",
        "Here we show the values of I and Var(E[U]) calculated by the agents, plotted against the correlation of the contract outcomes, ρ, that constituted their direct experience.",
        "The results are averaged over 106 simulation runs.",
        "Note that as expected, when the dimensions of the contract outcomes are uncorrelated (i.e. ρ = 0), then both approaches give the same results.",
        "However, the value of using our formalism with the full Dirichlet distribution is shown when the correlation between the dimensions increases (either negatively or positively).",
        "As can be seen, if we approximate the Dirichlet distribution with multiple independent beta distributions, all of the correlation information contained within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), is lost, and thus, the information content of the matrix is much lower.",
        "The loss of this correlation information leads the variance of the expected utility of the contract to be incorrect (either over or under estimated depending on the correlation)5 , with the exact amount of mis-estimation depending on the actual utility function chosen (i.e. the values of u(oa = 1) and u(ob = 1)).",
        "In addition, in figure 2 we illustrate an example of the estimates calculated through both methods, for a single exemplar set of contract outcomes.",
        "We represent the probability estimates, ˆp(X), and the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), in the standard way as an ellipse [1].",
        "That is, ˆp(X) determines the position of the center of the ellipse, Cov(p(X)) defines its size and shape.",
        "Note that whilst the ellipse resulting from the full Dirichlet formalism accurately reflects the true distribution (samples of which are plotted as points), that calculated by using multiple independent Beta distributions (and thus ignoring the correlations) results in a much larger ellipse that does not reflect the true distribution.",
        "The larger size of this ellipse is a result of the off-diagonal terms of the covariance matrix being set to zero, and corresponds to the agent miscalculating the uncertainty in the probability of each contract dimension being fulfilled.",
        "This, in turn, leads it to miscalculate the uncertainty in the expected utility of a contract (shown in figure 1 as Var(E[U]). 5.",

        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) ity that a multi-dimensional contract will be successfully fulfilled, we now go on to consider how agents within an open multi-agent system can communicate these estimates to one another.",
        "This is commonly referred to as reputation and allows agents with limited direct experience of a supplier to make rational decisions.",
        "Both Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al. present models whereby reputation is communicated between agents using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution [6, 11].",
        "This approach is attractive since these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of contracts observed, N, and the number of these that were successfully fulfilled, n).",
        "Under the probabilistic framework of the beta distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agents own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.",
        "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",
        "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",
        "For instance, in the case of three dimensions, N, is given by: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information.",
        "Again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier.",
        "Finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here, by adopting the same principled approach as Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within this multi-dimensional model.",
        "However, we now go on to consider a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks. 6.",
        "RUMOUR PROPAGATION WITHIN REPUTATION SYSTEMS In the previous section, we described the use of sufficient statistics to communicate reputation, and we showed that by aggregating contract outcomes together into these sufficient statistics, a large number of contract outcomes can be represented and communicated in a compact form.",
        "Whilst, this is an attractive property, it can be problematic in practise, since the individual provenance of each contract outcome is lost in the aggregation.",
        "Thus, to ensure an accurate estimate, the reputation system must ensure that each observation of a contract outcome is included within the aggregated statistics no more than once.",
        "Within a centralised reputation system, where all agents report their direct experience to a trusted center, such double counting of contract outcomes is easy to avoid.",
        "However, in a decentralised reputation system, where agents communicate reputation to one another, and aggregate their direct experience with these reputation reports on-the-fly, avoiding double counting is much more difficult. a1 a2 a3 ¨ ¨¨ ¨¨ ¨¨B E T N1 N1 N1 + N2 Figure 3: Example of rumour propagation in a decentralised reputation system.",
        "For example, consider the case shown in figure 3 where three agents (a1 . . . a3), each with some direct experience of a supplier, share reputation reports regarding this supplier.",
        "If agent a1 were to provide its estimate to agents a2 and a3 in the form of the sufficient statistics of its Dirichlet distribution, then these agents can aggregate these contract outcomes with their own, and thus obtain more precise estimates.",
        "If at a later stage, agent a2 were to send its aggregate vector of contract outcomes to agent a3, then agent a3 being unaware of the full history of exchanges, may attempt to combine these contract outcomes with its own aggregated vector.",
        "However, since both vectors contain a contribution from agent a1, these will be counted twice in the final aggregated vector, and will result in a biased and overconfident estimate.",
        "This is termed rumour propagation or data incest in the data fusion literature [9].",
        "One possible solution would be to uniquely identify the source of each contract outcome, and then propagate each vector, along with its label, through the network.",
        "Agents can thus identify identical observations that have arrived through different routes, and after removing the duplicates, can aggregate these together to form their estimates.",
        "Whilst this appears to be attractive in principle, for a number of reasons, it is not always a viable solution in practise [12].",
        "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
        "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
        "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",
        "Finally, it may actually be difficult to assign globally agreeable, consistent, and unique labels for each agent within an open system.",
        "In the next section, we develop a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems.",
        "Our solution is based on an approach developed within the area of target tracking and data fusion [9].",
        "It avoids the need to uniquely identify an agent, it allows agents to restrict the number of other agents who they reveal their private estimates to, and yet it still allows information to propagate throughout the network. 6.1 Private and Shared Information Our solution to rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems introduces the notion of private information that an agent knows it has not communicated to any other agent, and shared information that has been communicated to, or received from, another agent.",
        "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

        "To understand this, consider the case that agent aα sends its private and shared contract outcome vectors, Nα p and Nα s , to agent aβ that itself has private and shared contract outcomes Nβ p and Nβ s .",
        "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
        "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
        "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
        "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
        "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
        "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
        "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
        "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
        "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
        "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
        "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
        "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
        "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
        "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
        "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",
        "Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3).",
        "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
        "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
        "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
        "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
        "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
        "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
        "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",
        "This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network.",
        "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
        "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",
        "The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4.",
        "Here we show the sum of the information content of each agents covariance matrix (calculated as discussed earlier in section 4.3), for each of these four different approaches.",
        "We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration.",
        "Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved.",
        "This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases.",
        "Next, we note that in the case of rumour propagation, the information content increases continually, and rapidly exceeds the centralised reputation result.",
        "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",
        "Finally, we note that using private and shared information represents a compromise between the private information only case and the centralised reputation case.",
        "Information is still allowed to propagate around the network, however rumours are eliminated.",

        "As expected, the centralised reputation system achieves the best estimate of the true distribution, since it uses the direct experience of all agents.",
        "The private information only case shows the largest ellipse since it propagates the least information around the network.",
        "The rumour propagation case shows the smallest ellipse, but it is inconsistent with the actual distribution p(X).",
        "Thus, propagating rumours around the network and double counting contract outcomes in the belief that they are independent events, results in an overconfident estimate.",
        "However, we note that our solution, using separate vectors of private and shared information, allows us to propagate more information than the private information only case, but we completely avoid the problems of rumour propagation.",
        "Finally, we consider the effect that this has on the agents calculation of the expected utility of the contract.",
        "We assume the same utility function as used in section 4.3 (i.e. u(oa = 1) = 6 and u(ob = 1) = 2), and in table 1 we present the estimate of the expected utility, and its standard deviation calculated for all four cases by a single agent at iteration five (after communication has ceased to have any further effect for all methods other than rumour propagation).",
        "We note that the rumour propagation case is clearly inconsistent with the centralised reputation system, since its standard deviation is too small and does not reflect the true uncertainty in the expected utility, given the contract outcomes.",
        "However, we observe that our solution represents the closest case to the centralised reputation system, and thus succeeds in propagating information throughout the network, whilst also avoiding bias and overconfidence.",
        "The exact difference between it and the centralised reputation system depends upon the topology of the network, and the history of exchanges that take place within it. 7.",
        "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we addressed the need for a principled probabilistic model of computational trust that deals with contracts that have multiple correlated dimensions.",
        "Our starting point was an agent estimating the expected utility of a contract, and we showed that this leads to a model of computational trust that uses the Dirichlet distribution to calculate a trust estimate from the direct experience of an agent.",
        "We then showed how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to represent and communicate reputation within a decentralised reputation system, and we presented a solution to rumour propagation within these systems.",
        "Our future work in this area is to extend the exchange of reputation to the case where contracts are not homogeneous.",
        "That is, not all agents observe the same contract dimensions.",

        "Nuestro punto de partida es considerar a un agente intentando estimar la utilidad de un contrato, y mostramos que esto conduce a un modelo de confianza computacional en el cual un agente debe determinar un vector de estimaciones que representen la probabilidad de que se cumpla exitosamente cualquier dimensión del contrato, y una matriz de covarianza que describa la incertidumbre y correlaciones en estas probabilidades.",

        "INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación.",
        "En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos.",
        "Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión).",
        "Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11].",
        "Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados.",
        "En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes.",
        "Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad).",
        "Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7].",
        "Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión.",
        "Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones.",
        "Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad.",
        "Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo.",
        "Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato.",
        "Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles).",
        "Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados.",
        "El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor.",
        "Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores.",
        "Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente.",
        "En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1.",
        "Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones.",
        "Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente.",
        "Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3.",
        "Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos.",
        "Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4.",
        "Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados.",
        "Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida.",
        "Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza.",
        "El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado.",
        "En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la sección 4.",
        "En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación.",
        "Concluimos en la sección 7.2.",
        "TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional.",
        "Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos.",
        "Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva.",
        "Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4].",
        "En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte.",
        "Él desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores.",
        "Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles.",
        "Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5].",
        "Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores.",
        "Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre.",
        "Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola.",
        "Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión.",
        "Jøsang e Ismail describen el Sistema de Reputación Beta, en el cual la reputación de un agente se compila a partir de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6].",
        "La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio fundamentado para representar la incertidumbre.",
        "Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluyen un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descontar las opiniones de agentes que tienen calificaciones de reputación bajas, y técnicas para manejar reputaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo.",
        "Asimismo, Teacy et al. utilizan la distribución beta para describir la creencia de un agente en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla exitosamente con sus compromisos [11].",
        "Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad basándose en su experiencia directa, y nuevamente utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes.",
        "Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial, y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan con veracidad sus estimaciones de confianza.",
        "Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque basado en principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes.",
        "Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más fundamentados.",
        "Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato.",
        "Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato.",
        "En el caso unidimensional, esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.).",
        "Sin embargo, luego pasamos a extender este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, es decir, la distribución de Dirichlet, para representar la creencia de los agentes sobre múltiples dimensiones. 3.",
        "CONFIANZA UNIDIMENSIONAL Antes de presentar nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional, primero introducimos la notación y el formalismo que utilizaremos describiendo el caso más familiar unidimensional.",
        "Consideramos a un agente que debe decidir si comprometerse en un contrato futuro con un proveedor.",
        "Este contrato llevará a algún resultado, o, y consideramos que o = 1 si el contrato se cumple con éxito, y o = 0 si no.",
        "Para que el agente pueda tomar una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato.",
        "Suponemos que en caso de que el contrato se cumpla con éxito, el agente obtiene una utilidad u(o = 1), de lo contrario no recibe ninguna utilidad.",
        "Ahora, dado que el agente no está seguro de la fiabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá el contrato, debería considerar la utilidad esperada que obtendrá, E[U], y esto se da por: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) donde p(o = 1) es la probabilidad de que el proveedor cumpla exitosamente con el contrato.",
        "Sin embargo, aunque el agente conoce u(o = 1), no conoce p(o = 1).",
        "Lo mejor que el agente puede hacer es determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1) dados sus experiencias directas de resultados de contratos anteriores.",
        "Dado que ha sido capaz de hacerlo, puede entonces determinar una estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, E[E[U]], y una medida de su incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada, Var(E[U]).",
        "Esta incertidumbre es importante ya que un agente adverso al riesgo puede tomar una decisión con respecto a un contrato. Nota que solo consideramos resultados de contratos binarios, aunque extender esto a resultados parciales es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro. Claramente esto puede extenderse al caso en el que se derive cierta utilidad de un resultado no exitoso. Nota que esto a menudo se llama la utilidad esperada esperada, y esta es la notación que adoptamos aquí.",
        "El Sexto Internacional.",
        "La Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) no solo se basa en su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, sino también en la probabilidad de que la utilidad esperada supere cierta cantidad mínima.",
        "Estas dos propiedades se dan por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) donde ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) son la estimación y la incertidumbre de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, y se calculan a partir de la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) que el agente determina a partir de su experiencia directa.",
        "El enfoque basado en utilidad que presentamos aquí proporciona una motivación atractiva para este modelo de Teacy et al. [11].",
        "Ahora, en el caso de resultados de contratos binarios, la distribución beta es la elección natural para representar la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) ya que dentro de la estadística bayesiana se sabe que es la distribución previa conjugada para observaciones binomiales [3].",
        "Al adoptar la distribución beta, podemos calcular ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) utilizando resultados estándar, y así, si un agente observó N contratos anteriores de los cuales n se cumplieron con éxito, entonces: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 y: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Tenga en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuanto mayor sea el número de contratos que el agente observa, menor será el término de varianza Var(p(o = 1)), y, por lo tanto, menor será la incertidumbre con respecto a la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1).",
        "CONFIANZA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL Ahora extendemos la descripción anterior para considerar contratos entre proveedores y agentes que están representados por múltiples dimensiones, por lo que el éxito o fracaso de un contrato puede descomponerse en el éxito o fracaso de cada dimensión por separado.",
        "Considera nuevamente el ejemplo de la cadena de suministro que especifica la puntualidad, cantidad y calidad de los bienes que deben ser entregados.",
        "Por lo tanto, dentro de nuestro modelo de confianza, oa = 1 ahora indica un resultado exitoso sobre la dimensión a del contrato y oa = 0 indica uno no exitoso.",
        "Un resultado de contrato, X, está compuesto ahora por un vector de resultados de partes individuales del contrato (por ejemplo,",
        "X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . . }).",
        "Dado un contrato multidimensional cuyo resultado está descrito por el vector X, consideramos nuevamente que para que un agente tome una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato.",
        "Con este fin, podemos hacer la afirmación general de que la utilidad esperada de un contrato se da por: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) donde p(X) es una distribución conjunta de probabilidad sobre todos los posibles resultados del contrato: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) y U(X) es la utilidad derivada de estos posibles resultados: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) Como antes, mientras que U(X) es conocido por el agente, la distribución de probabilidad p(X) no lo es.",
        "Más bien, dada la experiencia directa de los agentes con el proveedor, el agente puede determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(X).",
        "En el caso unidimensional, una distribución beta fue la elección natural sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1).",
        "En el caso multi-dimensional, donde p(X) en sí mismo es un vector de probabilidades, la elección natural correspondiente es la distribución de Dirichlet, ya que esta es una distribución previa conjugada para proporciones multinomiales [3].",
        "Dada esta distribución, el agente puede calcular una estimación de la utilidad esperada de un contrato.",
        "Como antes, esta estimación está representada por un valor esperado dado por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) y una varianza, que describe la incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) donde: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Así, mientras que el caso unidimensional naturalmente conduce a un modelo de confianza en el que los agentes intentan derivar una estimación de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1), junto con una varianza escalar que describe la incertidumbre en esta probabilidad, Var(p(o = 1)), en este caso, los agentes deben derivar una estimación de un vector de probabilidades, ˆp(X), junto con una matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), que representa la incertidumbre en p(X) dadas las consecuencias contractuales observadas.",
        "En este punto, es interesante notar que la estimación en el caso unidimensional, ˆp(o = 1), tiene un claro significado semántico en relación con la confianza; es la creencia de los agentes en la probabilidad de que un proveedor cumpla exitosamente un contrato.",
        "Sin embargo, en el caso multidimensional, el agente debe determinar ˆp(X), y dado que esto describe la probabilidad de todos los posibles resultados del contrato, incluidos aquellos que no se cumplen en absoluto, esta interpretación semántica directa no está presente.",
        "En la siguiente sección, describimos la función de utilidad ejemplar que utilizaremos en el resto de este documento. 4.1 Función de Utilidad Ejemplar El enfoque descrito hasta ahora es completamente general, ya que se aplica a cualquier función de utilidad del tipo descrito anteriormente, y también se aplica a la estimación de cualquier distribución de probabilidad conjunta.",
        "En el resto de este documento, con fines ilustrativos, limitaremos la discusión a la función de utilidad más simple posible que muestre una dependencia de las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato.",
        "Es decir, consideramos el caso en el que la utilidad esperada depende solo de las probabilidades marginales de que se cumpla exitosamente cada dimensión del contrato, en lugar de las probabilidades conjuntas completas: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Por lo tanto, ˆp(X) es una estimación vectorial de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se cumpla exitosamente, y mantiene la clara interpretación semántica vista en el caso unidimensional: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) Las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato afectan la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada.",
        "Para ver esto, considera la covarianza 1072 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional.",
        "La matriz que describe esta incertidumbre, Cov(p(X)), en la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se da ahora por: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . .",

        "En la siguiente sección, utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular tanto ˆp(X) como Cov(p(X)) a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente en los resultados de contratos anteriores.",
        "Primero ilustramos por qué esto es necesario considerando un enfoque alternativo para modelar contratos multidimensionales, en el cual un agente asume ingenuamente que las dimensiones son independientes, y por lo tanto, modela cada una individualmente mediante distribuciones beta separadas (como en el caso unidimensional que presentamos en la sección 3).",
        "Esto es en realidad equivalente a establecer los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), a cero.",
        "Sin embargo, hacerlo puede llevar a un agente a asumir que su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato es más precisa de lo que en realidad es.",
        "Para ilustrar esto, considera un escenario específico con los siguientes valores: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 y Va = Vb = 0.2.",
        "En este caso, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), y por lo tanto, si se ignora la correlación Cab, la varianza en la utilidad esperada es de 0.4.",
        "Sin embargo, si los resultados del contrato están completamente correlacionados, entonces Cab = 1 y Var(E[U]) es en realidad 0.8.",
        "Por lo tanto, para tener una estimación precisa de la varianza de la utilidad del contrato esperada, y para tomar una decisión racional, es esencial que el agente sea capaz de representar y calcular estos términos de correlación.",
        "En la siguiente sección, describimos cómo un agente puede hacerlo utilizando la distribución de Dirichlet. 4.2 La Distribución de Dirichlet En esta sección, describimos cómo el agente puede utilizar su experiencia directa de contratos anteriores y los resultados estándar de la distribución de Dirichlet para determinar una estimación de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato sea cumplida exitosamente, ˆp(X), y una medida de las incertidumbres en estas probabilidades que expresa las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato, Cov(p(X)).",
        "Primero consideramos el cálculo de ˆp(X) y los términos diagonales de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)).",
        "Como se describe arriba, la derivación de estos resultados es idéntica al caso de la distribución beta unidimensional, donde de N resultados de contratos, n se cumplen exitosamente.",
        "En el caso multi-dimensional, sin embargo, tenemos un vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} que representa el número de resultados para los cuales se cumplieron con éxito cada una de las dimensiones individuales del contrato.",
        "Por lo tanto, en términos de los parámetros estándar de Dirichlet donde αa = na + 1 y α0 = N + 2, el agente puede estimar la probabilidad de que esta dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 y también puede calcular la varianza en cualquier dimensión del contrato: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Sin embargo, calcular los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de Cov(p(X)) es más complejo ya que es necesario considerar las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato.",
        "Por lo tanto, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), debemos considerar todas las posibles combinaciones de resultados de contrato, y así definimos nab ij como el número de resultados de contrato para los cuales tanto oa = i como ob = j.",
        "Por ejemplo, nab 10 representa el número de contratos para los cuales oa = 1 y ob = 0.",
        "Ahora, utilizando la notación estándar de Dirichlet, podemos definir αab ij nab ij + 1 para todos los i y j que toman valores 0 y 1, y luego, para calcular las correlaciones cruzadas entre los pares de contratos a y b, observamos que la distribución de Dirichlet sobre las probabilidades conjuntas par a par es: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 donde: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 y Kab es una constante de normalización [3].",
        "A partir de esto podemos derivar estimaciones de probabilidad y varianzas por pares: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) donde: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) y de hecho, α0 = N + 2, donde N es el número total de contratos observados.",
        "Asimismo, podemos expresar la covarianza en estas probabilidades por pares en términos similares: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0). Finalmente, podemos utilizar la expresión: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) para determinar la covarianza Cab.",
        "Para hacerlo, primero simplificamos la notación definiendo V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] y Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)].",
        "La covarianza para la probabilidad de resultados positivos de contrato es entonces la covarianza entre j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) e i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), y por lo tanto: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11.",
        "Por lo tanto, dado un conjunto de resultados de contratos que representan las interacciones previas de los agentes con un proveedor, podemos utilizar la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular la media y la varianza de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato (es decir, ˆp(oa = 1) y Va).",
        "Además, mediante un procedimiento algo más complejo también podemos calcular las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades (es decir, ...",

        "A su vez, estos resultados pueden ser utilizados para calcular la estimación y la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada del contrato.",

        "Sin embargo, el valor de utilizar nuestro formalismo con la distribución de Dirichlet completa se muestra cuando la correlación entre las dimensiones aumenta (ya sea de forma negativa o positiva).",
        "Como se puede observar, si aproximamos la distribución de Dirichlet con múltiples distribuciones beta independientes, toda la información de correlación contenida en la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), se pierde, y por lo tanto, el contenido informativo de la matriz es mucho menor.",

        "El tamaño más grande de esta elipse es resultado de que los términos fuera de la diagonal de la matriz de covarianza se establecieron en cero, y corresponde a que el agente calculó erróneamente la incertidumbre en la probabilidad de que se cumpla cada dimensión del contrato.",
        "Esto, a su vez, hace que se calcule de forma incorrecta la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada de un contrato (mostrada en la figura 1 como Var(E[U]). 5.",
        "COMUNICANDO REPUTACIÓN Habiendo descrito cómo un agente individual puede utilizar su propia experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para estimar la probabilidad.

        "Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), ahora pasamos a considerar cómo los agentes dentro de un sistema multiagente abierto pueden comunicar estas estimaciones entre sí.",
        "Esto se conoce comúnmente como reputación y permite a los agentes con experiencia directa limitada de un proveedor tomar decisiones racionales.",
        "Tanto Jøsang e Ismail, como Teacy y colaboradores, presentan modelos en los que la reputación se comunica entre agentes utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta [6, 11].",
        "Este enfoque es atractivo ya que estas estadísticas suficientes son simples agregaciones de los resultados de los contratos (más precisamente, simplemente son el número total de contratos observados, N, y el número de estos que se cumplieron exitosamente, n).",
        "Bajo el marco probabilístico de la distribución beta, los informes de reputación en esta forma simplemente pueden ser agregados con la propia experiencia directa de un agente, con el fin de obtener una estimación más precisa basada en un conjunto más amplio de resultados de contratos.",
        "Podemos extender inmediatamente este enfoque al caso multidimensional considerado aquí, al requerir que los agentes intercambien las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet en lugar de la distribución beta.",
        "En este caso, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), los agentes deben comunicar un vector de resultados de contrato, N, que son las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet, dadas por: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Por lo tanto, un agente puede comunicar las estadísticas suficientes de su propia distribución de Dirichlet en términos de solo 2d(d − 1) números (donde d es el número de dimensiones de contrato).",
        "Por ejemplo, en el caso de tres dimensiones, N, se da por: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > y, por lo tanto, conjuntos grandes de resultados de contratos pueden ser comunicados dentro de un tamaño de mensaje relativamente pequeño, sin pérdida de información.",
        "Una vez más, los agentes que reciben estas estadísticas suficientes pueden simplemente agregarlas a su propia experiencia directa para obtener una estimación más precisa de la confiabilidad de un proveedor.",
        "Finalmente, cabe destacar que si bien no es el enfoque de nuestro trabajo aquí, al adoptar el mismo enfoque basado en principios que Jøsang e Ismail, y Teacy y otros, muchas de las técnicas que han desarrollado (como descontar informes de agentes no confiables y filtrar informes inconsistentes de agentes egoístas) pueden aplicarse directamente dentro de este modelo multidimensional.",
        "Sin embargo, ahora pasamos a considerar un nuevo problema que surge tanto en los modelos unidimensionales como multidimensionales, a saber, los problemas que surgen cuando dichas estadísticas suficientes agregadas se propagan dentro de redes de agentes descentralizados. 6.",
        "PROPAGACIÓN DE RUMORES DENTRO DE SISTEMAS DE REPUTACIÓN En la sección anterior, describimos el uso de estadísticas suficientes para comunicar la reputación, y demostramos que al agregar los resultados de los contratos en estas estadísticas suficientes, se puede representar y comunicar un gran número de resultados de contratos de forma compacta.",
        "Si bien esta es una propiedad atractiva, puede ser problemática en la práctica, ya que la procedencia individual de cada resultado de contrato se pierde en la agregación.",
        "Por lo tanto, para garantizar una estimación precisa, el sistema de reputación debe asegurarse de que cada observación de un resultado de contrato se incluya en las estadísticas agregadas no más de una vez.",
        "Dentro de un sistema de reputación centralizado, donde todos los agentes informan sus experiencias directas a un centro de confianza, es fácil evitar el doble conteo de resultados de contratos.",
        "Sin embargo, en un sistema de reputación descentralizado, donde los agentes comunican la reputación entre sí y agregan su experiencia directa con estos informes de reputación sobre la marcha, evitar el doble conteo es mucho más difícil.",
        "Por ejemplo, considera el caso mostrado en la figura 3 donde tres agentes (a1 . . . a3), cada uno con cierta experiencia directa de un proveedor, comparten informes de reputación sobre este proveedor.",
        "Si el agente a1 proporcionara su estimación a los agentes a2 y a3 en forma de las estadísticas suficientes de su distribución de Dirichlet, entonces estos agentes pueden agregar estos resultados contractuales con los suyos propios, y así obtener estimaciones más precisas.",
        "Si en una etapa posterior, el agente a2 enviara su vector agregado de resultados de contratos al agente a3, entonces el agente a3, al no estar al tanto de toda la historia de intercambios, podría intentar combinar estos resultados de contratos con su propio vector agregado.",
        "Sin embargo, dado que ambos vectores contienen una contribución del agente a1, estos serán contados dos veces en el vector agregado final, lo que resultará en una estimación sesgada y excesivamente confiada.",
        "Esto se denomina propagación de rumores o incesto de datos en la literatura de fusión de datos [9].",
        "Una posible solución sería identificar de manera única la fuente de cada resultado de contrato, y luego propagar cada vector, junto con su etiqueta, a través de la red.",
        "Los agentes pueden identificar así observaciones idénticas que han llegado por diferentes rutas, y después de eliminar los duplicados, pueden agregarlos juntos para formar sus estimaciones.",
        "Si bien esto parece atractivo en principio, por varias razones, no siempre es una solución viable en la práctica [12].",
        "En primer lugar, los agentes pueden no desear que sus resultados de contrato etiquetados de manera única se compartan en un sistema abierto, ya que dicha información puede tener importancia comercial o práctica que podría ser utilizada en su contra.",
        "Por lo tanto, es posible que los agentes solo estén dispuestos a intercambiar resultados de contratos identificables con un pequeño número de otros agentes (quizás aquellos con los que tengan algún tipo de relación recíproca).",
        "En segundo lugar, el hecho de que no haya una agregación de los resultados del contrato a medida que circulan por la red significa que el tamaño del mensaje aumenta con el tiempo, y el tamaño final de estos mensajes está limitado únicamente por el número de agentes dentro del sistema (posiblemente un número extremadamente grande para un sistema global).",
        "Finalmente, puede resultar realmente difícil asignar etiquetas globalmente aceptables, consistentes y únicas para cada agente dentro de un sistema abierto.",
        "En la siguiente sección, desarrollamos una solución novedosa al problema de la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados.",
        "Nuestra solución se basa en un enfoque desarrollado dentro del área de seguimiento de objetivos y fusión de datos [9].",
        "Evita la necesidad de identificar de forma única a un agente, permite a los agentes restringir la cantidad de otros agentes a los que revelan sus estimaciones privadas, y aún así permite que la información se propague por toda la red. 6.1 Información Privada y Compartida Nuestra solución para la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados introduce la noción de información privada que un agente sabe que no ha comunicado a ningún otro agente, y de información compartida que ha sido comunicada a, o recibida de, otro agente.",
        "Por lo tanto, el agente puede descomponer su vector de resultado de contrato, N, en dos vectores, uno privado, Np, que no ha sido comunicado a otro agente, y uno compartido, Ns, que ha sido compartido con, o recibido de, otro agente: N = Np + Ns (19). Ahora, cada vez que un agente comunica la reputación, comunica ambos vectores privados y compartidos por separado.",

        "En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), los agentes emisores y receptores actualizan sus dos vectores de manera apropiada.",
        "Para entender esto, considera el caso en el que el agente aα envía sus vectores de resultados de contrato privados y compartidos, Nα p y Nα s, al agente aβ que a su vez tiene resultados de contrato privados y compartidos Nβ p y Nβ s.",
        "Cada agente actualiza sus vectores de resultados de contrato de acuerdo con el siguiente procedimiento: • Agente de origen: Una vez que el agente de origen ha enviado tanto sus vectores de resultados de contrato compartidos como privados a otro agente, su información privada ya no es privada.",
        "Por lo tanto, debe eliminar los resultados de contrato que estaban en su vector privado y agregarlos a su vector compartido: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Agente Receptor: El objetivo del agente receptor es acumular el mayor número de resultados de contrato (ya que esto resultará en la estimación más precisa) sin incluir información compartida tanto de sí mismo como del otro agente (ya que esto podría resultar en la duplicación de resultados de contrato).",
        "Tiene dos opciones dependiendo del número total de resultados de contrato dentro de su propio vector compartido, Nβ s , y dentro del del agente de origen, Nα s.",
        "Así, actualiza su vector de acuerdo con el procedimiento siguiente: - Nβ s > Nα s: Si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un mayor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente combina su vector compartido con el vector privado del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. - Nβ s < Nα s: Alternativamente, si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un menor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente receptor descarta su propio vector compartido y forma uno nuevo a partir de los vectores privado y compartido del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios.",
        "En caso de que Nβ s = Nα s, entonces cualquiera de las opciones es apropiada.",
        "Una vez que el agente receptor ha actualizado sus conjuntos, utiliza los resultados del contrato en ambos para formar su estimación de confianza.",
        "Si los agentes reciben varios vectores simultáneamente, este enfoque se generaliza al agente receptor utilizando el vector compartido más grande, y los vectores privados de sí mismo y de todos los agentes originales para formar su nuevo vector compartido.",
        "Este procedimiento tiene varias propiedades atractivas.",
        "En primer lugar, dado que los resultados de los contratos en un vector compartido de agentes nunca se combinan con los de otro agente en el vector compartido, los resultados que provienen del mismo agente nunca se combinan entre sí, y por lo tanto, la propagación de rumores se evita por completo.",
        "Sin embargo, dado que el agente receptor puede descartar su propio vector compartido y adoptar el vector compartido del agente de origen, la información sigue propagándose por la red.",
        "Además, dado que los resultados de los contratos se agregan juntos dentro de los vectores privados y compartidos, el tamaño del mensaje es constante y no aumenta a medida que aumenta el número de interacciones.",
        "Finalmente, un agente solo comunica los resultados de su propio contrato privado a sus vecinos inmediatos.",
        "Si este agente 6 lo transmite posteriormente, lo hace como información agregada no identificable dentro de su información compartida.",
        "Por lo tanto, un agente puede limitar el número de agentes con los que está dispuesto a revelar resultados de contratos identificables, y sin embargo, estos resultados de contratos aún pueden propagarse dentro de la red, y así mejorar las estimaciones de otros agentes.",
        "A continuación, demostramos empíricamente que estas propiedades pueden ser realizadas en la práctica. 6.2 Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de este procedimiento, simulamos redes aleatorias compuestas por diez agentes.",
        "Cada agente tiene cierta experiencia directa de interactuar con un proveedor (como se describe en la sección 4.3).",
        "En cada iteración de la simulación, interactúa con sus vecinos inmediatos y intercambia informes de reputación a través de las estadísticas suficientes de sus distribuciones de Dirichlet.",
        "Comparamos nuestra solución con dos de las alternativas descentralizadas más obvias: • Información Privada y Compartida: Los agentes siguen el procedimiento descrito en la sección anterior.",
        "Es decir, mantienen vectores separados privados y compartidos de resultados de contrato, y en cada iteración comunican ambos vectores a sus vecinos inmediatos. • Propagación de rumores: Los agentes no diferencian entre resultados de contrato privados y compartidos.",
        "En la primera iteración comunican todos los resultados del contrato que constituyen su experiencia directa.",
        "En iteraciones posteriores, propagan los resultados de los contratos que reciben de cualquiera de los vecinos a todos sus otros vecinos inmediatos. • Solo Información Privada: Los agentes solo comunican los resultados de los contratos que constituyen su experiencia directa.",

        "Comparamos estos tres enfoques descentralizados con un sistema de reputación centralizado: • Reputación Centralizada: Todos los agentes transmiten su experiencia directa a un sistema de reputación centralizado que las agrega y devuelve esta estimación a cada agente.",
        "Esta solución centralizada hace el uso más efectivo de la información disponible en la red.",
        "Sin embargo, la mayoría de los problemas del mundo real requieren soluciones descentralizadas debido a preocupaciones de escalabilidad, modularidad y comunicación.",
        "Por lo tanto, esta solución centralizada se incluye ya que representa el caso óptimo, y nos permite comparar nuestra solución descentralizada.",

        "Aquí mostramos la suma del contenido de información de la matriz de covarianza de cada agente (calculada como se discutió anteriormente en la sección 4.3), para cada uno de estos cuatro enfoques diferentes.",
        "Primero observamos que cuando solo se comunica información privada, no hay cambio en la información después de la primera iteración.",
        "Una vez que cada agente ha recibido la experiencia directa de sus vecinos inmediatos, no se puede lograr un aumento adicional en la información.",
        "Esto representa la comunicación mínima y exhibe la menor cantidad total de información de los cuatro casos.",

        "El hecho de que el caso de propagación de rumores exceda incorrectamente este límite indica que está contando continuamente los mismos resultados de contrato a medida que circulan por la red, creyendo que son eventos independientes.",

        "Finalmente, consideramos el efecto que esto tiene en el cálculo del valor esperado de utilidad del contrato por parte de los agentes.",
        "Suponemos la misma función de utilidad que se utilizó en la sección 4.3 (es decir, u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2), y en la tabla 1 presentamos la estimación de la utilidad esperada y su desviación estándar calculada para los cuatro casos por un único agente en la quinta iteración (después de que la comunicación haya dejado de tener efecto adicional para todos los métodos excepto la propagación de rumores).",
        "Observamos que el caso de propagación de rumores es claramente inconsistente con el sistema de reputación centralizado, ya que su desviación estándar es demasiado pequeña y no refleja la verdadera incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada, dadas las consecuencias del contrato.",
        "Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución representa el caso más cercano al sistema de reputación centralizado, y por lo tanto logra propagar la información a lo largo de la red, evitando al mismo tiempo el sesgo y la sobreconfianza.",
        "La diferencia exacta entre esto y el sistema de reputación centralizado depende de la topología de la red y de la historia de intercambios que tienen lugar dentro de ella. 7.",
        "CONCLUSIONES En este artículo abordamos la necesidad de un modelo probabilístico fundamentado de confianza computacional que maneje contratos con múltiples dimensiones correlacionadas.",
        "Nuestro punto de partida fue un agente que estimaba la utilidad esperada de un contrato, y demostramos que esto conduce a un modelo de confianza computacional que utiliza la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular una estimación de confianza a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente.",
        "Luego mostramos cómo los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para representar y comunicar la reputación dentro de un sistema de reputación descentralizado, y presentamos una solución a la propagación de rumores dentro de estos sistemas.",

                "Our starting point is to consider an agent attempting to estimate the utility of a contract, and we show that this leads to a model of computational trust whereby an agent must determine a vector of estimates that represent the probability that any dimension of the contract will be successfully fulfilled, and a covariance matrix that describes the uncertainty and correlations in these probabilities.",
                "We present a formalism based on the Dirichlet distribution that allows an agent to calculate these probabilities and correlations from their direct experience of contract outcomes, and we show that this leads to superior estimates compared to an alternative approach using multiple independent beta distributions.",
                "We then show how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to communicate and fuse reputation within a decentralised reputation system.",
                "Finally, we present a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within such systems.",

                "INTRODUCTION The role of computational models of trust within multi-agent systems in particular, and open distributed systems in general, has recently generated a great deal of research interest.",
                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
                "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
                "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",
                "To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",
                "The starting point for our work is to consider how an agent can estimate the utility that it will derive from interacting with a supplier.",
                "Here we use standard approaches from the literature of data fusion (since this is a well developed field where the notion of multi-dimensional correlated estimates is well established1 ) to show that this naturally leads to a <br>trust model</br> where the agent must estimate probabilities and correlations over 1 In this context, the multiple dimensions typically represent the physical coordinates of a target being tracked, and correlations arise through the operation and orientation of sensors. 1070 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS multiple dimensions.",

                "This approach is attractive since these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of contracts observed, N, and the number of these that were successfully fulfilled, n).",
                "Under the probabilistic framework of the beta distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agents own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.",
                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",
                "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",
                "For instance, in the case of three dimensions, N, is given by: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information.",
                "Again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier.",
                "Finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here, by adopting the same principled approach as Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within this multi-dimensional model.",
                "However, we now go on to consider a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks. 6.",
                "RUMOUR PROPAGATION WITHIN REPUTATION SYSTEMS In the previous section, we described the use of sufficient statistics to communicate reputation, and we showed that by aggregating contract outcomes together into these sufficient statistics, a large number of contract outcomes can be represented and communicated in a compact form.",

                "If at a later stage, agent a2 were to send its aggregate vector of contract outcomes to agent a3, then agent a3 being unaware of the full history of exchanges, may attempt to combine these contract outcomes with its own aggregated vector.",
                "However, since both vectors contain a contribution from agent a1, these will be counted twice in the final aggregated vector, and will result in a biased and overconfident estimate.",

                "One possible solution would be to uniquely identify the source of each contract outcome, and then propagate each vector, along with its label, through the network.",
                "Agents can thus identify identical observations that have arrived through different routes, and after removing the duplicates, can aggregate these together to form their estimates.",
                "Whilst this appears to be attractive in principle, for a number of reasons, it is not always a viable solution in practise [12].",
                "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
                "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",
                "Finally, it may actually be difficult to assign globally agreeable, consistent, and unique labels for each agent within an open system.",

                "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
                "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
                "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",

                "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
                "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
                "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
                "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",
                "This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network.",
                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
                "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",

En este artículo desarrollamos un novedoso modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. Nuestro punto de partida es considerar a un agente intentando estimar la utilidad de un contrato, y mostramos que esto conduce a un modelo de confianza computacional en el cual un agente debe determinar un vector de estimaciones que representen la probabilidad de que se cumpla exitosamente cualquier dimensión del contrato, y una matriz de covarianza que describa la incertidumbre y correlaciones en estas probabilidades. Presentamos un formalismo basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a un agente calcular estas probabilidades y correlaciones a partir de su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos, y demostramos que esto conduce a estimaciones superiores en comparación con un enfoque alternativo que utiliza múltiples distribuciones beta independientes. Luego mostramos cómo los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para comunicar y fusionar la reputación dentro de un sistema descentralizado de reputación. Finalmente, presentamos una solución novedosa al problema de la propagación de rumores dentro de tales sistemas.

INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un <br>modelo de confianza</br> donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo <br>modelo de confianza</br> que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso <br>modelo de confianza</br> probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro <br>modelo de confianza</br> multidimensional en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un <br>modelo de confianza</br> multidimensional. ",

                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
                "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",

                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",

                "Sabater and Sierra present a model of reputation, in which agents form contracts based on multiple variables (such as delivery date and quality), and define impressions as subjective evaluations of the outcome of these contracts.",
                "They provide <br>heuristic</br> approaches to combining these impressions to form a measure they call subjective reputation.",
                "Likewise, Griffiths decomposes overall trust into a number of different dimensions such as success, cost, timeliness and quality [4].",
                "In his case, each dimension is scored as a real number that represents a comparative value with no strong semantic meaning.",
                "He develops an <br>heuristic</br> rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an <br>heuristic</br> function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers.",

                "Nevertheless, they show that agents who select suppliers based on these multiple dimensions outperform those who consider just a single one.",
                "By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension.",
                "Jøsang and Ismail describe the Beta Reputation System whereby the reputation of an agent is compiled from the positive and negative reports from other agents who have interacted with it [6].",
                "The beta distribution represents a natural choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a principled means of representing uncertainty.",
                "Moreover, they provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques to deal with reputations that may change over time.",
                "Likewise, Teacy et al. use the beta distribution to describe an agents belief in the probability that another agent will successfully fulfill its commitments [11].",

                "Given that it has been able to do so, it can then determine an estimate of the expected utility4 of the contract, E[E[U]], and a measure of its uncertainty in this expected utility, Var(E[U]).",
                "This uncertainty is important since a risk averse agent may make a decision regarding a contract, 2 Note that we only consider binary contract outcomes, although extending this to partial outcomes is part of our future work. 3 Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is derived from an unsuccessful outcome. 4 Note that this is often called the expected expected utility, and this is the notation that we adopt here [2].",

                "Now, in the case of binary contract outcomes, the beta distribution is the natural choice to represent the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) since within Bayesian statistics this well known to be the conjugate prior for binomial observations [3].",
                "By adopting the beta distribution, we can calculate ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) using standard results, and thus, if an agent observed N previous contracts of which n were successfully fulfilled, then: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 and: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Note that as expected, the greater the number of contracts the agent observes, the smaller the variance term Var(p(o = 1)), and, thus, the less the uncertainty regarding the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1). 4.",
                "MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TRUST We now extend the description above, to consider contracts between suppliers and agents that are represented by multiple dimensions, and hence the success or failure of a contract can be decomposed into the success or failure of each separate dimension.",

                "Rather, given the agents direct experience of the supplier, the agent can determine a distribution over possible values for p(X).",
                "In the single dimensional case, a beta distribution was the natural choice over possible values of p(o = 1).",
                "In the multi-dimensional case, where p(X) itself is a vector of probabilities, the corresponding natural choice is the Dirichlet distribution, since this is a conjugate prior for multinomial proportions [3].",
                "Given this distribution, the agent is then able to calculate an estimate of the expected utility of a contract.",
                "As before, this estimate is itself represented by an expected value given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) and a variance, describing the uncertainty in this expected utility: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) where: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Thus, whilst the single dimensional case naturally leads to a trust model in which the agents attempt to derive an estimate of probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1), along with a scalar variance that describes the uncertainty in this probability, Var(p(o = 1)), in this case, the agents must derive an estimate of a vector of probabilities, ˆp(X), along with a covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), that represents the uncertainty in p(X) given the observed contractual outcomes.",
                "At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract.",
                "However, in the multi-dimensional case the agent must determine ˆp(X), and since this describes the probability of all possible contract outcomes, including those that are completely un-fulfilled, this direct semantic interpretation is not present.",
                "In the next section, we describe the exemplar utility function that we shall use in the remainder of this paper. 4.1 Exemplar Utility Function The approach described so far is completely general, in that it applies to any utility function of the form described above, and also applies to the estimation of any joint probability distribution.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, for illustrative purposes, we shall limit the discussion to the simplest possible utility function that exhibits a dependence upon the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
                "That is, we consider the case that expected utility is dependent only on the marginal probabilities of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, rather than the full joint probabilities: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Thus, ˆp(X) is a vector estimate of the probability of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, and maintains the clear semantic interpretation seen in the single dimensional case: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) The correlations between the contract dimensions affect the uncertainty in the expected utility.",

                "We first illustrate why this is necessary by considering an alternative approach to modelling multi-dimensional contracts whereby an agent na¨ıvely assumes that the dimensions are independent, and thus, it models each individually by separate beta distributions (as in the single dimensional case we presented in section 3).",
                "This is actually equivalent to setting the off-diagonal terms within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), to zero.",
                "However, doing so can lead an agent to assume that its estimate of the expected utility of the contract is more accurate than it actually is.",

                "Thus, in order to have an accurate estimate of the variance of the expected contract utility, and to make a rational decision, it is essential that the agent is able to represent and calculate these correlation terms.",
                "In the next section, we describe how an agent may do so using the Dirichlet distribution. 4.2 The Dirichlet Distribution In this section, we describe how the agent may use its direct experience of previous contracts, and the standard results of the Dirichlet distribution, to determine an estimate of the probability that each contract dimension will be successful fulfilled, ˆp(X), and a measure of the uncertainties in these probabilities that expresses the correlations between the contract dimensions, Cov(p(X)).",

                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",

                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",

INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques <br>heurísticos</br> para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Él desarrolla una regla <br>heurística</br> para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función <br>heurística</br> que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5]. Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión. Jøsang e Ismail describen el Sistema de Reputación Beta, en el cual la reputación de un agente se compila a partir de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6]. La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio fundamentado para representar la incertidumbre. Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluyen un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descontar las opiniones de agentes que tienen calificaciones de reputación bajas, y técnicas para manejar reputaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo. Asimismo, Teacy et al. utilizan la distribución beta para describir la creencia de un agente en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla exitosamente con sus compromisos [11]. Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad basándose en su experiencia directa, y nuevamente utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes. Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial, y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan con veracidad sus estimaciones de confianza. Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque basado en principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes. Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más fundamentados. Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato. En el caso unidimensional, esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.). Sin embargo, luego pasamos a extender este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, es decir, la distribución de Dirichlet, para representar la creencia de los agentes sobre múltiples dimensiones. 3. CONFIANZA UNIDIMENSIONAL Antes de presentar nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional, primero introducimos la notación y el formalismo que utilizaremos describiendo el caso más familiar unidimensional. Consideramos a un agente que debe decidir si comprometerse en un contrato futuro con un proveedor. Este contrato llevará a algún resultado, o, y consideramos que o = 1 si el contrato se cumple con éxito, y o = 0 si no. Para que el agente pueda tomar una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Suponemos que en caso de que el contrato se cumpla con éxito, el agente obtiene una utilidad u(o = 1), de lo contrario no recibe ninguna utilidad. Ahora, dado que el agente no está seguro de la fiabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá el contrato, debería considerar la utilidad esperada que obtendrá, E[U], y esto se da por: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) donde p(o = 1) es la probabilidad de que el proveedor cumpla exitosamente con el contrato. Sin embargo, aunque el agente conoce u(o = 1), no conoce p(o = 1). Lo mejor que el agente puede hacer es determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1) dados sus experiencias directas de resultados de contratos anteriores. Dado que ha sido capaz de hacerlo, puede entonces determinar una estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, E[E[U]], y una medida de su incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada, Var(E[U]). Esta incertidumbre es importante ya que un agente adverso al riesgo puede tomar una decisión con respecto a un contrato. Nota que solo consideramos resultados de contratos binarios, aunque extender esto a resultados parciales es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro. Claramente esto puede extenderse al caso en el que se derive cierta utilidad de un resultado no exitoso. Nota que esto a menudo se llama la utilidad esperada esperada, y esta es la notación que adoptamos aquí. El Sexto Internacional. La Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) no solo se basa en su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, sino también en la probabilidad de que la utilidad esperada supere cierta cantidad mínima. Estas dos propiedades se dan por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) donde ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) son la estimación y la incertidumbre de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, y se calculan a partir de la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) que el agente determina a partir de su experiencia directa. El enfoque basado en utilidad que presentamos aquí proporciona una motivación atractiva para este modelo de Teacy et al. [11]. Ahora, en el caso de resultados de contratos binarios, la distribución beta es la elección natural para representar la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) ya que dentro de la estadística bayesiana se sabe que es la distribución previa conjugada para observaciones binomiales [3]. Al adoptar la distribución beta, podemos calcular ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) utilizando resultados estándar, y así, si un agente observó N contratos anteriores de los cuales n se cumplieron con éxito, entonces: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 y: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Tenga en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuanto mayor sea el número de contratos que el agente observa, menor será el término de varianza Var(p(o = 1)), y, por lo tanto, menor será la incertidumbre con respecto a la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1). CONFIANZA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL Ahora extendemos la descripción anterior para considerar contratos entre proveedores y agentes que están representados por múltiples dimensiones, por lo que el éxito o fracaso de un contrato puede descomponerse en el éxito o fracaso de cada dimensión por separado. Considera nuevamente el ejemplo de la cadena de suministro que especifica la puntualidad, cantidad y calidad de los bienes que deben ser entregados. Por lo tanto, dentro de nuestro modelo de confianza, oa = 1 ahora indica un resultado exitoso sobre la dimensión a del contrato y oa = 0 indica uno no exitoso. Un resultado de contrato, X, está compuesto ahora por un vector de resultados de partes individuales del contrato (por ejemplo, X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . . }). Dado un contrato multidimensional cuyo resultado está descrito por el vector X, consideramos nuevamente que para que un agente tome una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Con este fin, podemos hacer la afirmación general de que la utilidad esperada de un contrato se da por: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) donde p(X) es una distribución conjunta de probabilidad sobre todos los posibles resultados del contrato: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) y U(X) es la utilidad derivada de estos posibles resultados: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) Como antes, mientras que U(X) es conocido por el agente, la distribución de probabilidad p(X) no lo es. Más bien, dada la experiencia directa de los agentes con el proveedor, el agente puede determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(X). En el caso unidimensional, una distribución beta fue la elección natural sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1). En el caso multi-dimensional, donde p(X) en sí mismo es un vector de probabilidades, la elección natural correspondiente es la distribución de Dirichlet, ya que esta es una distribución previa conjugada para proporciones multinomiales [3]. Dada esta distribución, el agente puede calcular una estimación de la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Como antes, esta estimación está representada por un valor esperado dado por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) y una varianza, que describe la incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) donde: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Así, mientras que el caso unidimensional naturalmente conduce a un modelo de confianza en el que los agentes intentan derivar una estimación de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1), junto con una varianza escalar que describe la incertidumbre en esta probabilidad, Var(p(o = 1)), en este caso, los agentes deben derivar una estimación de un vector de probabilidades, ˆp(X), junto con una matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), que representa la incertidumbre en p(X) dadas las consecuencias contractuales observadas. En este punto, es interesante notar que la estimación en el caso unidimensional, ˆp(o = 1), tiene un claro significado semántico en relación con la confianza; es la creencia de los agentes en la probabilidad de que un proveedor cumpla exitosamente un contrato. Sin embargo, en el caso multidimensional, el agente debe determinar ˆp(X), y dado que esto describe la probabilidad de todos los posibles resultados del contrato, incluidos aquellos que no se cumplen en absoluto, esta interpretación semántica directa no está presente. En la siguiente sección, describimos la función de utilidad ejemplar que utilizaremos en el resto de este documento. 4.1 Función de Utilidad Ejemplar El enfoque descrito hasta ahora es completamente general, ya que se aplica a cualquier función de utilidad del tipo descrito anteriormente, y también se aplica a la estimación de cualquier distribución de probabilidad conjunta. En el resto de este documento, con fines ilustrativos, limitaremos la discusión a la función de utilidad más simple posible que muestre una dependencia de las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Es decir, consideramos el caso en el que la utilidad esperada depende solo de las probabilidades marginales de que se cumpla exitosamente cada dimensión del contrato, en lugar de las probabilidades conjuntas completas: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Por lo tanto, ˆp(X) es una estimación vectorial de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se cumpla exitosamente, y mantiene la clara interpretación semántica vista en el caso unidimensional: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) Las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato afectan la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada. Para ver esto, considera la covarianza 1072 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. La matriz que describe esta incertidumbre, Cov(p(X)), en la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se da ahora por: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . . I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab Vb Cbc . . .\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for translation? En esta matriz, los términos diagonales, Va, Vb y Vc, representan las incertidumbres en p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) y p(oc = 1) dentro de p(X). Los términos fuera de la diagonal, Cab, Cac y Cbc, representan las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades. En la siguiente sección, utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular tanto ˆp(X) como Cov(p(X)) a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente en los resultados de contratos anteriores. Primero ilustramos por qué esto es necesario considerando un enfoque alternativo para modelar contratos multidimensionales, en el cual un agente asume ingenuamente que las dimensiones son independientes, y por lo tanto, modela cada una individualmente mediante distribuciones beta separadas (como en el caso unidimensional que presentamos en la sección 3). Esto es en realidad equivalente a establecer los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), a cero. Sin embargo, hacerlo puede llevar a un agente a asumir que su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato es más precisa de lo que en realidad es. Para ilustrar esto, considera un escenario específico con los siguientes valores: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 y Va = Vb = 0.2. En este caso, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), y por lo tanto, si se ignora la correlación Cab, la varianza en la utilidad esperada es de 0.4. Sin embargo, si los resultados del contrato están completamente correlacionados, entonces Cab = 1 y Var(E[U]) es en realidad 0.8. Por lo tanto, para tener una estimación precisa de la varianza de la utilidad del contrato esperada, y para tomar una decisión racional, es esencial que el agente sea capaz de representar y calcular estos términos de correlación. En la siguiente sección, describimos cómo un agente puede hacerlo utilizando la distribución de Dirichlet. 4.2 La Distribución de Dirichlet En esta sección, describimos cómo el agente puede utilizar su experiencia directa de contratos anteriores y los resultados estándar de la distribución de Dirichlet para determinar una estimación de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato sea cumplida exitosamente, ˆp(X), y una medida de las incertidumbres en estas probabilidades que expresa las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato, Cov(p(X)). Primero consideramos el cálculo de ˆp(X) y los términos diagonales de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)). Como se describe arriba, la derivación de estos resultados es idéntica al caso de la distribución beta unidimensional, donde de N resultados de contratos, n se cumplen exitosamente. En el caso multi-dimensional, sin embargo, tenemos un vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} que representa el número de resultados para los cuales se cumplieron con éxito cada una de las dimensiones individuales del contrato. Por lo tanto, en términos de los parámetros estándar de Dirichlet donde αa = na + 1 y α0 = N + 2, el agente puede estimar la probabilidad de que esta dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 y también puede calcular la varianza en cualquier dimensión del contrato: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Sin embargo, calcular los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de Cov(p(X)) es más complejo ya que es necesario considerar las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Por lo tanto, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), debemos considerar todas las posibles combinaciones de resultados de contrato, y así definimos nab ij como el número de resultados de contrato para los cuales tanto oa = i como ob = j. Por ejemplo, nab 10 representa el número de contratos para los cuales oa = 1 y ob = 0. Ahora, utilizando la notación estándar de Dirichlet, podemos definir αab ij nab ij + 1 para todos los i y j que toman valores 0 y 1, y luego, para calcular las correlaciones cruzadas entre los pares de contratos a y b, observamos que la distribución de Dirichlet sobre las probabilidades conjuntas par a par es: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 donde: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 y Kab es una constante de normalización [3]. A partir de esto podemos derivar estimaciones de probabilidad y varianzas por pares: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) donde: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) y de hecho, α0 = N + 2, donde N es el número total de contratos observados. Asimismo, podemos expresar la covarianza en estas probabilidades por pares en términos similares: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0). Finalmente, podemos utilizar la expresión: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) para determinar la covarianza Cab. Para hacerlo, primero simplificamos la notación definiendo V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] y Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)]. La covarianza para la probabilidad de resultados positivos de contrato es entonces la covarianza entre j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) e i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), y por lo tanto: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11. Por lo tanto, dado un conjunto de resultados de contratos que representan las interacciones previas de los agentes con un proveedor, podemos utilizar la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular la media y la varianza de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato (es decir, ˆp(oa = 1) y Va). Además, mediante un procedimiento algo más complejo también podemos calcular las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades (es decir, ... I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab).\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for me to translate to Spanish? Esto nos permite calcular una estimación de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato, ˆp(X), y también representar la incertidumbre y correlaciones en estas probabilidades mediante la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)). A su vez, estos resultados pueden ser utilizados para calcular la estimación y la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada del contrato. En la siguiente sección presentamos resultados empíricos que muestran que en la práctica este formalismo produce mejoras significativas en estas estimaciones en comparación con la aproximación ingenua que utiliza múltiples distribuciones beta independientes. Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de nuestro formalismo y mostrar la importancia de los términos fuera de la diagonal en Cov(p(X)), comparamos dos enfoques: La Sexta Conferencia Internacional.

Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones, y las barras de error muestran el error estándar en la media. • Distribución de Dirichlet: Utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet completa, como se describe arriba, para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), incluyendo todos sus términos fuera de la diagonal que representan las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. • Distribuciones Beta Independientes: Utilizamos distribuciones beta independientes para representar cada dimensión del contrato, con el fin de calcular ˆp(X), y luego, como se describió anteriormente, aproximamos Cov(p(X)) e ignoramos las correlaciones al establecer todos los términos fuera de la diagonal en cero. Consideramos un caso bidimensional donde u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2, ya que esto nos permite trazar ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) como elipses en un plano bidimensional, y así explicar las diferencias entre los dos enfoques. Específicamente, inicialmente asignamos al agente algunos resultados de contratos anteriores que representan su experiencia directa con un proveedor. El número de contratos se elige de forma uniforme entre 10 y 20, y los resultados reales de los contratos se eligen de una distribución conjunta arbitraria destinada a inducir correlaciones entre las dimensiones de los contratos. Para cada conjunto de contratos, utilizamos los enfoques descritos anteriormente para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), y por lo tanto, la varianza en la utilidad esperada del contrato, Var(E[U]). Además, calculamos una medida escalar del contenido de información, I, de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)), que es una forma estándar de medir la incertidumbre codificada dentro de la matriz de covarianza [1]. Más específicamente, calculamos el determinante de la inversa de la matriz de covarianza: I = det(Cov(p(X))−1 ) (16) y observamos que cuanto mayor sea el contenido de información, más precisa será ˆp(X), y por lo tanto, mejor será la estimación de la utilidad esperada que el agente puede calcular. Finalmente, utilizamos los resultados 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 p(o =1) p(o=1) a b Distribución de Dirichlet Distribuciones Beta Independientes Figura 2: Ejemplos de ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) representados como elipses de segundo error estándar. presentados en la sección 4.2 para calcular la correlación real, ρ, asociada con este conjunto particular de resultados de contrato: ρ = Cab √ VaVb (17) donde Cab, Va y Vb se calculan como se describe en la sección 4.2. Los resultados de este análisis se muestran en la figura 1. Aquí mostramos los valores de I y Var(E[U]) calculados por los agentes, representados en función de la correlación de los resultados del contrato, ρ, que constituyeron su experiencia directa. Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones de simulación. Se debe tener en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuando las dimensiones de los resultados del contrato no están correlacionadas (es decir, ρ = 0), ambos enfoques dan los mismos resultados. Sin embargo, el valor de utilizar nuestro formalismo con la distribución de Dirichlet completa se muestra cuando la correlación entre las dimensiones aumenta (ya sea de forma negativa o positiva). Como se puede observar, si aproximamos la distribución de Dirichlet con múltiples distribuciones beta independientes, toda la información de correlación contenida en la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), se pierde, y por lo tanto, el contenido informativo de la matriz es mucho menor. La pérdida de esta información de correlación hace que la varianza de la utilidad esperada del contrato sea incorrecta (ya sea sobreestimada o subestimada dependiendo de la correlación), con la cantidad exacta de subestimación dependiendo de la función de utilidad real elegida (es decir, los valores de u(oa = 1) y u(ob = 1)). Además, en la figura 2 ilustramos un ejemplo de las estimaciones calculadas a través de ambos métodos, para un único conjunto de resultados de contratos. Representamos las estimaciones de probabilidad, ˆp(X), y la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), de la manera estándar como una elipse [1]. Es decir, ˆp(X) determina la posición del centro de la elipse, Cov(p(X)) define su tamaño y forma. Cabe destacar que si bien la elipse resultante del formalismo completo de Dirichlet refleja con precisión la verdadera distribución (cuyas muestras se representan como puntos), la calculada al utilizar múltiples distribuciones Beta independientes (y por lo tanto ignorando las correlaciones) resulta en una elipse mucho más grande que no refleja la verdadera distribución. El tamaño más grande de esta elipse es resultado de que los términos fuera de la diagonal de la matriz de covarianza se establecieron en cero, y corresponde a que el agente calculó erróneamente la incertidumbre en la probabilidad de que se cumpla cada dimensión del contrato. Esto, a su vez, hace que se calcule de forma incorrecta la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada de un contrato (mostrada en la figura 1 como Var(E[U]). 5. COMUNICANDO REPUTACIÓN Habiendo descrito cómo un agente individual puede utilizar su propia experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para estimar la probabilidad. Nota que las gráficas no son suaves debido al hecho de que, dado un número limitado de resultados de contratos, la media de Va y Vb no varía suavemente con ρ. 1074 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), ahora pasamos a considerar cómo los agentes dentro de un sistema multiagente abierto pueden comunicar estas estimaciones entre sí. Esto se conoce comúnmente como reputación y permite a los agentes con experiencia directa limitada de un proveedor tomar decisiones racionales. Tanto Jøsang e Ismail, como Teacy y colaboradores, presentan modelos en los que la reputación se comunica entre agentes utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta [6, 11]. Este enfoque es atractivo ya que estas estadísticas suficientes son simples agregaciones de los resultados de los contratos (más precisamente, simplemente son el número total de contratos observados, N, y el número de estos que se cumplieron exitosamente, n). Bajo el marco probabilístico de la distribución beta, los informes de reputación en esta forma simplemente pueden ser agregados con la propia experiencia directa de un agente, con el fin de obtener una estimación más precisa basada en un conjunto más amplio de resultados de contratos. Podemos extender inmediatamente este enfoque al caso multidimensional considerado aquí, al requerir que los agentes intercambien las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet en lugar de la distribución beta. En este caso, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), los agentes deben comunicar un vector de resultados de contrato, N, que son las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet, dadas por: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Por lo tanto, un agente puede comunicar las estadísticas suficientes de su propia distribución de Dirichlet en términos de solo 2d(d − 1) números (donde d es el número de dimensiones de contrato). Por ejemplo, en el caso de tres dimensiones, N, se da por: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > y, por lo tanto, conjuntos grandes de resultados de contratos pueden ser comunicados dentro de un tamaño de mensaje relativamente pequeño, sin pérdida de información. Una vez más, los agentes que reciben estas estadísticas suficientes pueden simplemente agregarlas a su propia experiencia directa para obtener una estimación más precisa de la confiabilidad de un proveedor. Finalmente, cabe destacar que si bien no es el enfoque de nuestro trabajo aquí, al adoptar el mismo enfoque basado en principios que Jøsang e Ismail, y Teacy y otros, muchas de las técnicas que han desarrollado (como descontar informes de agentes no confiables y filtrar informes inconsistentes de agentes egoístas) pueden aplicarse directamente dentro de este modelo multidimensional. Sin embargo, ahora pasamos a considerar un nuevo problema que surge tanto en los modelos unidimensionales como multidimensionales, a saber, los problemas que surgen cuando dichas estadísticas suficientes agregadas se propagan dentro de redes de agentes descentralizados. 6. PROPAGACIÓN DE RUMORES DENTRO DE SISTEMAS DE REPUTACIÓN En la sección anterior, describimos el uso de estadísticas suficientes para comunicar la reputación, y demostramos que al agregar los resultados de los contratos en estas estadísticas suficientes, se puede representar y comunicar un gran número de resultados de contratos de forma compacta. Si bien esta es una propiedad atractiva, puede ser problemática en la práctica, ya que la procedencia individual de cada resultado de contrato se pierde en la agregación. Por lo tanto, para garantizar una estimación precisa, el sistema de reputación debe asegurarse de que cada observación de un resultado de contrato se incluya en las estadísticas agregadas no más de una vez. Dentro de un sistema de reputación centralizado, donde todos los agentes informan sus experiencias directas a un centro de confianza, es fácil evitar el doble conteo de resultados de contratos. Sin embargo, en un sistema de reputación descentralizado, donde los agentes comunican la reputación entre sí y agregan su experiencia directa con estos informes de reputación sobre la marcha, evitar el doble conteo es mucho más difícil. Por ejemplo, considera el caso mostrado en la figura 3 donde tres agentes (a1 . . . a3), cada uno con cierta experiencia directa de un proveedor, comparten informes de reputación sobre este proveedor. Si el agente a1 proporcionara su estimación a los agentes a2 y a3 en forma de las estadísticas suficientes de su distribución de Dirichlet, entonces estos agentes pueden agregar estos resultados contractuales con los suyos propios, y así obtener estimaciones más precisas. Si en una etapa posterior, el agente a2 enviara su vector agregado de resultados de contratos al agente a3, entonces el agente a3, al no estar al tanto de toda la historia de intercambios, podría intentar combinar estos resultados de contratos con su propio vector agregado. Sin embargo, dado que ambos vectores contienen una contribución del agente a1, estos serán contados dos veces en el vector agregado final, lo que resultará en una estimación sesgada y excesivamente confiada. Esto se denomina propagación de rumores o incesto de datos en la literatura de fusión de datos [9]. Una posible solución sería identificar de manera única la fuente de cada resultado de contrato, y luego propagar cada vector, junto con su etiqueta, a través de la red. Los agentes pueden identificar así observaciones idénticas que han llegado por diferentes rutas, y después de eliminar los duplicados, pueden agregarlos juntos para formar sus estimaciones. Si bien esto parece atractivo en principio, por varias razones, no siempre es una solución viable en la práctica [12]. En primer lugar, los agentes pueden no desear que sus resultados de contrato etiquetados de manera única se compartan en un sistema abierto, ya que dicha información puede tener importancia comercial o práctica que podría ser utilizada en su contra. Por lo tanto, es posible que los agentes solo estén dispuestos a intercambiar resultados de contratos identificables con un pequeño número de otros agentes (quizás aquellos con los que tengan algún tipo de relación recíproca). En segundo lugar, el hecho de que no haya una agregación de los resultados del contrato a medida que circulan por la red significa que el tamaño del mensaje aumenta con el tiempo, y el tamaño final de estos mensajes está limitado únicamente por el número de agentes dentro del sistema (posiblemente un número extremadamente grande para un sistema global). Finalmente, puede resultar realmente difícil asignar etiquetas globalmente aceptables, consistentes y únicas para cada agente dentro de un sistema abierto. En la siguiente sección, desarrollamos una solución novedosa al problema de la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Nuestra solución se basa en un enfoque desarrollado dentro del área de seguimiento de objetivos y fusión de datos [9]. Evita la necesidad de identificar de forma única a un agente, permite a los agentes restringir la cantidad de otros agentes a los que revelan sus estimaciones privadas, y aún así permite que la información se propague por toda la red. 6.1 Información Privada y Compartida Nuestra solución para la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados introduce la noción de información privada que un agente sabe que no ha comunicado a ningún otro agente, y de información compartida que ha sido comunicada a, o recibida de, otro agente. Por lo tanto, el agente puede descomponer su vector de resultado de contrato, N, en dos vectores, uno privado, Np, que no ha sido comunicado a otro agente, y uno compartido, Ns, que ha sido compartido con, o recibido de, otro agente: N = Np + Ns (19). Ahora, cada vez que un agente comunica la reputación, comunica ambos vectores privados y compartidos por separado. Ambos el origEl Sexto Intl. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), los agentes emisores y receptores actualizan sus dos vectores de manera apropiada. Para entender esto, considera el caso en el que el agente aα envía sus vectores de resultados de contrato privados y compartidos, Nα p y Nα s, al agente aβ que a su vez tiene resultados de contrato privados y compartidos Nβ p y Nβ s. Cada agente actualiza sus vectores de resultados de contrato de acuerdo con el siguiente procedimiento: • Agente de origen: Una vez que el agente de origen ha enviado tanto sus vectores de resultados de contrato compartidos como privados a otro agente, su información privada ya no es privada. Por lo tanto, debe eliminar los resultados de contrato que estaban en su vector privado y agregarlos a su vector compartido: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Agente Receptor: El objetivo del agente receptor es acumular el mayor número de resultados de contrato (ya que esto resultará en la estimación más precisa) sin incluir información compartida tanto de sí mismo como del otro agente (ya que esto podría resultar en la duplicación de resultados de contrato). Tiene dos opciones dependiendo del número total de resultados de contrato dentro de su propio vector compartido, Nβ s , y dentro del del agente de origen, Nα s. Así, actualiza su vector de acuerdo con el procedimiento siguiente: - Nβ s > Nα s: Si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un mayor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente combina su vector compartido con el vector privado del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. - Nβ s < Nα s: Alternativamente, si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un menor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente receptor descarta su propio vector compartido y forma uno nuevo a partir de los vectores privado y compartido del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. En caso de que Nβ s = Nα s, entonces cualquiera de las opciones es apropiada. Una vez que el agente receptor ha actualizado sus conjuntos, utiliza los resultados del contrato en ambos para formar su estimación de confianza. Si los agentes reciben varios vectores simultáneamente, este enfoque se generaliza al agente receptor utilizando el vector compartido más grande, y los vectores privados de sí mismo y de todos los agentes originales para formar su nuevo vector compartido. Este procedimiento tiene varias propiedades atractivas. En primer lugar, dado que los resultados de los contratos en un vector compartido de agentes nunca se combinan con los de otro agente en el vector compartido, los resultados que provienen del mismo agente nunca se combinan entre sí, y por lo tanto, la propagación de rumores se evita por completo. Sin embargo, dado que el agente receptor puede descartar su propio vector compartido y adoptar el vector compartido del agente de origen, la información sigue propagándose por la red. Además, dado que los resultados de los contratos se agregan juntos dentro de los vectores privados y compartidos, el tamaño del mensaje es constante y no aumenta a medida que aumenta el número de interacciones. Finalmente, un agente solo comunica los resultados de su propio contrato privado a sus vecinos inmediatos. Si este agente 6 lo transmite posteriormente, lo hace como información agregada no identificable dentro de su información compartida. Por lo tanto, un agente puede limitar el número de agentes con los que está dispuesto a revelar resultados de contratos identificables, y sin embargo, estos resultados de contratos aún pueden propagarse dentro de la red, y así mejorar las estimaciones de otros agentes. A continuación, demostramos empíricamente que estas propiedades pueden ser realizadas en la práctica. 6.2 Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de este procedimiento, simulamos redes aleatorias compuestas por diez agentes. Cada agente tiene cierta experiencia directa de interactuar con un proveedor (como se describe en la sección 4.3). En cada iteración de la simulación, interactúa con sus vecinos inmediatos y intercambia informes de reputación a través de las estadísticas suficientes de sus distribuciones de Dirichlet. Comparamos nuestra solución con dos de las alternativas descentralizadas más obvias: • Información Privada y Compartida: Los agentes siguen el procedimiento descrito en la sección anterior. Es decir, mantienen vectores separados privados y compartidos de resultados de contrato, y en cada iteración comunican ambos vectores a sus vecinos inmediatos. • Propagación de rumores: Los agentes no diferencian entre resultados de contrato privados y compartidos. En la primera iteración comunican todos los resultados del contrato que constituyen su experiencia directa. En iteraciones posteriores, propagan los resultados de los contratos que reciben de cualquiera de los vecinos a todos sus otros vecinos inmediatos. • Solo Información Privada: Los agentes solo comunican los resultados de los contratos que constituyen su experiencia directa. En todos los casos, en cada iteración, los agentes utilizan la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular sus estimaciones de confianza. Comparamos estos tres enfoques descentralizados con un sistema de reputación centralizado: • Reputación Centralizada: Todos los agentes transmiten su experiencia directa a un sistema de reputación centralizado que las agrega y devuelve esta estimación a cada agente. Esta solución centralizada hace el uso más efectivo de la información disponible en la red. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los problemas del mundo real requieren soluciones descentralizadas debido a preocupaciones de escalabilidad, modularidad y comunicación. Por lo tanto, esta solución centralizada se incluye ya que representa el caso óptimo, y nos permite comparar nuestra solución descentralizada. Los resultados de estas comparaciones se muestran en la figura 4. Aquí mostramos la suma del contenido de información de la matriz de covarianza de cada agente (calculada como se discutió anteriormente en la sección 4.3), para cada uno de estos cuatro enfoques diferentes. Primero observamos que cuando solo se comunica información privada, no hay cambio en la información después de la primera iteración. Una vez que cada agente ha recibido la experiencia directa de sus vecinos inmediatos, no se puede lograr un aumento adicional en la información. Esto representa la comunicación mínima y exhibe la menor cantidad total de información de los cuatro casos. A continuación, observamos que en el caso de la propagación de rumores, el contenido de la información aumenta continuamente y supera rápidamente el resultado de la reputación centralizada. El hecho de que el caso de propagación de rumores exceda incorrectamente este límite indica que está contando continuamente los mismos resultados de contrato a medida que circulan por la red, creyendo que son eventos independientes. Finalmente, observamos que el uso de información privada y compartida representa un compromiso entre el caso de solo información privada y el caso de reputación centralizada. La información todavía se permite propagar por la red, sin embargo los rumores son eliminados. Como antes, también representamos una única instancia de las estimaciones de confianza de un agente (es decir, ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X))) como un conjunto de elipses en un 1076 The Sixth Intl.

Como era de esperar, el sistema de reputación centralizado logra la mejor estimación de la distribución real, ya que utiliza la experiencia directa de todos los agentes. El caso de información privada muestra la elipse más grande ya que propaga la menor cantidad de información alrededor de la red. El caso de propagación de rumores muestra la elipse más pequeña, pero es inconsistente con la distribución real p(X). Por lo tanto, propagar rumores en la red y contar dos veces los resultados de los contratos creyendo que son eventos independientes, resulta en una estimación excesivamente confiada. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución, utilizando vectores separados de información privada y compartida, nos permite propagar más información que en el caso de solo información privada, pero evitamos por completo los problemas de propagación de rumores. Finalmente, consideramos el efecto que esto tiene en el cálculo del valor esperado de utilidad del contrato por parte de los agentes. Suponemos la misma función de utilidad que se utilizó en la sección 4.3 (es decir, u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2), y en la tabla 1 presentamos la estimación de la utilidad esperada y su desviación estándar calculada para los cuatro casos por un único agente en la quinta iteración (después de que la comunicación haya dejado de tener efecto adicional para todos los métodos excepto la propagación de rumores). Observamos que el caso de propagación de rumores es claramente inconsistente con el sistema de reputación centralizado, ya que su desviación estándar es demasiado pequeña y no refleja la verdadera incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada, dadas las consecuencias del contrato. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución representa el caso más cercano al sistema de reputación centralizado, y por lo tanto logra propagar la información a lo largo de la red, evitando al mismo tiempo el sesgo y la sobreconfianza. La diferencia exacta entre esto y el sistema de reputación centralizado depende de la topología de la red y de la historia de intercambios que tienen lugar dentro de ella. 7. CONCLUSIONES En este artículo abordamos la necesidad de un modelo probabilístico fundamentado de confianza computacional que maneje contratos con múltiples dimensiones correlacionadas. Nuestro punto de partida fue un agente que estimaba la utilidad esperada de un contrato, y demostramos que esto conduce a un modelo de confianza computacional que utiliza la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular una estimación de confianza a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente. Luego mostramos cómo los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para representar y comunicar la reputación dentro de un sistema de reputación descentralizado, y presentamos una solución a la propagación de rumores dentro de estos sistemas. Nuestro trabajo futuro en esta área es extender el intercambio de reputación al caso en el que los contratos no son homogéneos. Es decir, no todos los agentes observan las mismas dimensiones del contrato. Esta es una extensión desafiante, ya que en este caso, las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet no pueden ser utilizadas directamente.

                "As can be seen, if we approximate the Dirichlet distribution with multiple independent beta distributions, all of the correlation information contained within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), is lost, and thus, the information content of the matrix is much lower.",

                "The larger size of this ellipse is a result of the off-diagonal terms of the covariance matrix being set to zero, and corresponds to the agent miscalculating the uncertainty in the probability of each contract dimension being fulfilled.",

                "Both Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al. present models whereby reputation is communicated between agents using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution [6, 11].",
                "This approach is attractive since these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of contracts observed, N, and the number of these that were successfully fulfilled, n).",
                "Under the probabilistic framework of the beta distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agents own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.",
                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",
                "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",
                "For instance, in the case of three dimensions, N, is given by: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information.",
                "Again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier.",
                "Finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here, by adopting the same principled approach as Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within this multi-dimensional model.",
                "However, we now go on to consider a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks. 6.",
                "RUMOUR PROPAGATION WITHIN REPUTATION SYSTEMS In the previous section, we described the use of sufficient statistics to communicate reputation, and we showed that by aggregating contract outcomes together into these sufficient statistics, a large number of contract outcomes can be represented and communicated in a compact form.",

                "If agent a1 were to provide its estimate to agents a2 and a3 in the form of the sufficient statistics of its Dirichlet distribution, then these agents can aggregate these contract outcomes with their own, and thus obtain more precise estimates.",
                "If at a later stage, agent a2 were to send its aggregate vector of contract outcomes to agent a3, then agent a3 being unaware of the full history of exchanges, may attempt to combine these contract outcomes with its own aggregated vector.",
                "However, since both vectors contain a contribution from agent a1, these will be counted twice in the final aggregated vector, and will result in a biased and overconfident estimate.",
                "This is termed rumour propagation or data incest in the data fusion literature [9].",
                "One possible solution would be to uniquely identify the source of each contract outcome, and then propagate each vector, along with its label, through the network.",
                "Agents can thus identify identical observations that have arrived through different routes, and after removing the duplicates, can aggregate these together to form their estimates.",
                "Whilst this appears to be attractive in principle, for a number of reasons, it is not always a viable solution in practise [12].",
                "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
                "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",
                "Finally, it may actually be difficult to assign globally agreeable, consistent, and unique labels for each agent within an open system.",
                "In the next section, we develop a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems.",
                "Our solution is based on an approach developed within the area of target tracking and data fusion [9].",
                "It avoids the need to uniquely identify an agent, it allows agents to restrict the number of other agents who they reveal their private estimates to, and yet it still allows information to propagate throughout the network. 6.1 Private and Shared Information Our solution to rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems introduces the notion of private information that an agent knows it has not communicated to any other agent, and shared information that has been communicated to, or received from, another agent.",
                "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

                "To understand this, consider the case that agent aα sends its private and shared contract outcome vectors, Nα p and Nα s , to agent aβ that itself has private and shared contract outcomes Nβ p and Nβ s .",
                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
                "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
                "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",
                "Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3).",
                "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
                "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
                "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
                "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",
                "This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network.",
                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
                "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",
                "The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4.",
                "Here we show the sum of the information content of each agents covariance matrix (calculated as discussed earlier in section 4.3), for each of these four different approaches.",
                "We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration.",
                "Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved.",
                "This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases.",

                "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",

Nuestro punto de partida es considerar a un agente intentando estimar la utilidad de un contrato, y mostramos que esto conduce a un modelo de confianza computacional en el cual un agente debe determinar un vector de estimaciones que representen la probabilidad de que se cumpla exitosamente cualquier dimensión del contrato, y una matriz de covarianza que describa la incertidumbre y correlaciones en estas probabilidades. Presentamos un formalismo basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a un agente calcular estas probabilidades y correlaciones a partir de su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos, y demostramos que esto conduce a estimaciones superiores en comparación con un enfoque alternativo que utiliza múltiples distribuciones beta independientes. Luego mostramos cómo los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para comunicar y fusionar la reputación dentro de un sistema descentralizado de reputación. Finalmente, presentamos una solución novedosa al problema de la propagación de rumores dentro de tales sistemas. Esta solución utiliza la noción de información privada y compartida, y proporciona estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando el sesgo y la sobreconfianza.

INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la <br>teoría de la probabilidad</br> [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Él desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5]. Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la <br>teoría de la probabilidad</br>, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión. Jøsang e Ismail describen el Sistema de Reputación Beta, en el cual la reputación de un agente se compila a partir de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6]. La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio fundamentado para representar la incertidumbre. Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluyen un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descontar las opiniones de agentes que tienen calificaciones de reputación bajas, y técnicas para manejar reputaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo. Asimismo, Teacy et al. utilizan la distribución beta para describir la creencia de un agente en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla exitosamente con sus compromisos [11]. Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad basándose en su experiencia directa, y nuevamente utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes. Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial, y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan con veracidad sus estimaciones de confianza. Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque basado en principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes. Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más fundamentados. Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato. En el caso unidimensional, esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.). Sin embargo, luego pasamos a extender este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, es decir, la distribución de Dirichlet, para representar la creencia de los agentes sobre múltiples dimensiones. 3. CONFIANZA UNIDIMENSIONAL Antes de presentar nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional, primero introducimos la notación y el formalismo que utilizaremos describiendo el caso más familiar unidimensional. Consideramos a un agente que debe decidir si comprometerse en un contrato futuro con un proveedor. Este contrato llevará a algún resultado, o, y consideramos que o = 1 si el contrato se cumple con éxito, y o = 0 si no. Para que el agente pueda tomar una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Suponemos que en caso de que el contrato se cumpla con éxito, el agente obtiene una utilidad u(o = 1), de lo contrario no recibe ninguna utilidad. Ahora, dado que el agente no está seguro de la fiabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá el contrato, debería considerar la utilidad esperada que obtendrá, E[U], y esto se da por: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) donde p(o = 1) es la probabilidad de que el proveedor cumpla exitosamente con el contrato. Sin embargo, aunque el agente conoce u(o = 1), no conoce p(o = 1). Lo mejor que el agente puede hacer es determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1) dados sus experiencias directas de resultados de contratos anteriores. Dado que ha sido capaz de hacerlo, puede entonces determinar una estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, E[E[U]], y una medida de su incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada, Var(E[U]). Esta incertidumbre es importante ya que un agente adverso al riesgo puede tomar una decisión con respecto a un contrato. Nota que solo consideramos resultados de contratos binarios, aunque extender esto a resultados parciales es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro. Claramente esto puede extenderse al caso en el que se derive cierta utilidad de un resultado no exitoso. Nota que esto a menudo se llama la utilidad esperada esperada, y esta es la notación que adoptamos aquí. El Sexto Internacional. La Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) no solo se basa en su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, sino también en la probabilidad de que la utilidad esperada supere cierta cantidad mínima. Estas dos propiedades se dan por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) donde ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) son la estimación y la incertidumbre de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, y se calculan a partir de la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) que el agente determina a partir de su experiencia directa. El enfoque basado en utilidad que presentamos aquí proporciona una motivación atractiva para este modelo de Teacy et al. [11]. Ahora, en el caso de resultados de contratos binarios, la distribución beta es la elección natural para representar la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) ya que dentro de la estadística bayesiana se sabe que es la distribución previa conjugada para observaciones binomiales [3]. Al adoptar la distribución beta, podemos calcular ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) utilizando resultados estándar, y así, si un agente observó N contratos anteriores de los cuales n se cumplieron con éxito, entonces: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 y: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Tenga en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuanto mayor sea el número de contratos que el agente observa, menor será el término de varianza Var(p(o = 1)), y, por lo tanto, menor será la incertidumbre con respecto a la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1). CONFIANZA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL Ahora extendemos la descripción anterior para considerar contratos entre proveedores y agentes que están representados por múltiples dimensiones, por lo que el éxito o fracaso de un contrato puede descomponerse en el éxito o fracaso de cada dimensión por separado. Considera nuevamente el ejemplo de la cadena de suministro que especifica la puntualidad, cantidad y calidad de los bienes que deben ser entregados. Por lo tanto, dentro de nuestro modelo de confianza, oa = 1 ahora indica un resultado exitoso sobre la dimensión a del contrato y oa = 0 indica uno no exitoso. Un resultado de contrato, X, está compuesto ahora por un vector de resultados de partes individuales del contrato (por ejemplo, X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . . }). Dado un contrato multidimensional cuyo resultado está descrito por el vector X, consideramos nuevamente que para que un agente tome una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Con este fin, podemos hacer la afirmación general de que la utilidad esperada de un contrato se da por: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) donde p(X) es una distribución conjunta de probabilidad sobre todos los posibles resultados del contrato: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) y U(X) es la utilidad derivada de estos posibles resultados: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) Como antes, mientras que U(X) es conocido por el agente, la distribución de probabilidad p(X) no lo es. Más bien, dada la experiencia directa de los agentes con el proveedor, el agente puede determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(X). En el caso unidimensional, una distribución beta fue la elección natural sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1). En el caso multi-dimensional, donde p(X) en sí mismo es un vector de probabilidades, la elección natural correspondiente es la distribución de Dirichlet, ya que esta es una distribución previa conjugada para proporciones multinomiales [3]. Dada esta distribución, el agente puede calcular una estimación de la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Como antes, esta estimación está representada por un valor esperado dado por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) y una varianza, que describe la incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) donde: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Así, mientras que el caso unidimensional naturalmente conduce a un modelo de confianza en el que los agentes intentan derivar una estimación de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1), junto con una varianza escalar que describe la incertidumbre en esta probabilidad, Var(p(o = 1)), en este caso, los agentes deben derivar una estimación de un vector de probabilidades, ˆp(X), junto con una matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), que representa la incertidumbre en p(X) dadas las consecuencias contractuales observadas. En este punto, es interesante notar que la estimación en el caso unidimensional, ˆp(o = 1), tiene un claro significado semántico en relación con la confianza; es la creencia de los agentes en la probabilidad de que un proveedor cumpla exitosamente un contrato. Sin embargo, en el caso multidimensional, el agente debe determinar ˆp(X), y dado que esto describe la probabilidad de todos los posibles resultados del contrato, incluidos aquellos que no se cumplen en absoluto, esta interpretación semántica directa no está presente. En la siguiente sección, describimos la función de utilidad ejemplar que utilizaremos en el resto de este documento. 4.1 Función de Utilidad Ejemplar El enfoque descrito hasta ahora es completamente general, ya que se aplica a cualquier función de utilidad del tipo descrito anteriormente, y también se aplica a la estimación de cualquier distribución de probabilidad conjunta. En el resto de este documento, con fines ilustrativos, limitaremos la discusión a la función de utilidad más simple posible que muestre una dependencia de las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Es decir, consideramos el caso en el que la utilidad esperada depende solo de las probabilidades marginales de que se cumpla exitosamente cada dimensión del contrato, en lugar de las probabilidades conjuntas completas: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Por lo tanto, ˆp(X) es una estimación vectorial de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se cumpla exitosamente, y mantiene la clara interpretación semántica vista en el caso unidimensional: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) Las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato afectan la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada. Para ver esto, considera la covarianza 1072 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. La matriz que describe esta incertidumbre, Cov(p(X)), en la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se da ahora por: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . . I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab Vb Cbc . . .\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for translation? En esta matriz, los términos diagonales, Va, Vb y Vc, representan las incertidumbres en p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) y p(oc = 1) dentro de p(X). Los términos fuera de la diagonal, Cab, Cac y Cbc, representan las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades. En la siguiente sección, utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular tanto ˆp(X) como Cov(p(X)) a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente en los resultados de contratos anteriores. Primero ilustramos por qué esto es necesario considerando un enfoque alternativo para modelar contratos multidimensionales, en el cual un agente asume ingenuamente que las dimensiones son independientes, y por lo tanto, modela cada una individualmente mediante distribuciones beta separadas (como en el caso unidimensional que presentamos en la sección 3). Esto es en realidad equivalente a establecer los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), a cero. Sin embargo, hacerlo puede llevar a un agente a asumir que su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato es más precisa de lo que en realidad es. Para ilustrar esto, considera un escenario específico con los siguientes valores: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 y Va = Vb = 0.2. En este caso, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), y por lo tanto, si se ignora la correlación Cab, la varianza en la utilidad esperada es de 0.4. Sin embargo, si los resultados del contrato están completamente correlacionados, entonces Cab = 1 y Var(E[U]) es en realidad 0.8. Por lo tanto, para tener una estimación precisa de la varianza de la utilidad del contrato esperada, y para tomar una decisión racional, es esencial que el agente sea capaz de representar y calcular estos términos de correlación. En la siguiente sección, describimos cómo un agente puede hacerlo utilizando la distribución de Dirichlet. 4.2 La Distribución de Dirichlet En esta sección, describimos cómo el agente puede utilizar su experiencia directa de contratos anteriores y los resultados estándar de la distribución de Dirichlet para determinar una estimación de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato sea cumplida exitosamente, ˆp(X), y una medida de las incertidumbres en estas probabilidades que expresa las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato, Cov(p(X)). Primero consideramos el cálculo de ˆp(X) y los términos diagonales de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)). Como se describe arriba, la derivación de estos resultados es idéntica al caso de la distribución beta unidimensional, donde de N resultados de contratos, n se cumplen exitosamente. En el caso multi-dimensional, sin embargo, tenemos un vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} que representa el número de resultados para los cuales se cumplieron con éxito cada una de las dimensiones individuales del contrato. Por lo tanto, en términos de los parámetros estándar de Dirichlet donde αa = na + 1 y α0 = N + 2, el agente puede estimar la probabilidad de que esta dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 y también puede calcular la varianza en cualquier dimensión del contrato: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Sin embargo, calcular los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de Cov(p(X)) es más complejo ya que es necesario considerar las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Por lo tanto, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), debemos considerar todas las posibles combinaciones de resultados de contrato, y así definimos nab ij como el número de resultados de contrato para los cuales tanto oa = i como ob = j. Por ejemplo, nab 10 representa el número de contratos para los cuales oa = 1 y ob = 0. Ahora, utilizando la notación estándar de Dirichlet, podemos definir αab ij nab ij + 1 para todos los i y j que toman valores 0 y 1, y luego, para calcular las correlaciones cruzadas entre los pares de contratos a y b, observamos que la distribución de Dirichlet sobre las probabilidades conjuntas par a par es: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 donde: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 y Kab es una constante de normalización [3]. A partir de esto podemos derivar estimaciones de probabilidad y varianzas por pares: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) donde: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) y de hecho, α0 = N + 2, donde N es el número total de contratos observados. Asimismo, podemos expresar la covarianza en estas probabilidades por pares en términos similares: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0). Finalmente, podemos utilizar la expresión: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) para determinar la covarianza Cab. Para hacerlo, primero simplificamos la notación definiendo V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] y Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)]. La covarianza para la probabilidad de resultados positivos de contrato es entonces la covarianza entre j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) e i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), y por lo tanto: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11. Por lo tanto, dado un conjunto de resultados de contratos que representan las interacciones previas de los agentes con un proveedor, podemos utilizar la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular la media y la varianza de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato (es decir, ˆp(oa = 1) y Va). Además, mediante un procedimiento algo más complejo también podemos calcular las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades (es decir, ... I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab).\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for me to translate to Spanish? Esto nos permite calcular una estimación de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato, ˆp(X), y también representar la incertidumbre y correlaciones en estas probabilidades mediante la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)). A su vez, estos resultados pueden ser utilizados para calcular la estimación y la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada del contrato. En la siguiente sección presentamos resultados empíricos que muestran que en la práctica este formalismo produce mejoras significativas en estas estimaciones en comparación con la aproximación ingenua que utiliza múltiples distribuciones beta independientes. Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de nuestro formalismo y mostrar la importancia de los términos fuera de la diagonal en Cov(p(X)), comparamos dos enfoques: La Sexta Conferencia Internacional.

Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones, y las barras de error muestran el error estándar en la media. • Distribución de Dirichlet: Utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet completa, como se describe arriba, para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), incluyendo todos sus términos fuera de la diagonal que representan las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. • Distribuciones Beta Independientes: Utilizamos distribuciones beta independientes para representar cada dimensión del contrato, con el fin de calcular ˆp(X), y luego, como se describió anteriormente, aproximamos Cov(p(X)) e ignoramos las correlaciones al establecer todos los términos fuera de la diagonal en cero. Consideramos un caso bidimensional donde u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2, ya que esto nos permite trazar ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) como elipses en un plano bidimensional, y así explicar las diferencias entre los dos enfoques. Específicamente, inicialmente asignamos al agente algunos resultados de contratos anteriores que representan su experiencia directa con un proveedor. El número de contratos se elige de forma uniforme entre 10 y 20, y los resultados reales de los contratos se eligen de una distribución conjunta arbitraria destinada a inducir correlaciones entre las dimensiones de los contratos. Para cada conjunto de contratos, utilizamos los enfoques descritos anteriormente para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), y por lo tanto, la varianza en la utilidad esperada del contrato, Var(E[U]). Además, calculamos una medida escalar del contenido de información, I, de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)), que es una forma estándar de medir la incertidumbre codificada dentro de la matriz de covarianza [1]. Más específicamente, calculamos el determinante de la inversa de la matriz de covarianza: I = det(Cov(p(X))−1 ) (16) y observamos que cuanto mayor sea el contenido de información, más precisa será ˆp(X), y por lo tanto, mejor será la estimación de la utilidad esperada que el agente puede calcular. Finalmente, utilizamos los resultados 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 p(o =1) p(o=1) a b Distribución de Dirichlet Distribuciones Beta Independientes Figura 2: Ejemplos de ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) representados como elipses de segundo error estándar. presentados en la sección 4.2 para calcular la correlación real, ρ, asociada con este conjunto particular de resultados de contrato: ρ = Cab √ VaVb (17) donde Cab, Va y Vb se calculan como se describe en la sección 4.2. Los resultados de este análisis se muestran en la figura 1. Aquí mostramos los valores de I y Var(E[U]) calculados por los agentes, representados en función de la correlación de los resultados del contrato, ρ, que constituyeron su experiencia directa. Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones de simulación. Se debe tener en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuando las dimensiones de los resultados del contrato no están correlacionadas (es decir, ρ = 0), ambos enfoques dan los mismos resultados. Sin embargo, el valor de utilizar nuestro formalismo con la distribución de Dirichlet completa se muestra cuando la correlación entre las dimensiones aumenta (ya sea de forma negativa o positiva). Como se puede observar, si aproximamos la distribución de Dirichlet con múltiples distribuciones beta independientes, toda la información de correlación contenida en la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), se pierde, y por lo tanto, el contenido informativo de la matriz es mucho menor. La pérdida de esta información de correlación hace que la varianza de la utilidad esperada del contrato sea incorrecta (ya sea sobreestimada o subestimada dependiendo de la correlación), con la cantidad exacta de subestimación dependiendo de la función de utilidad real elegida (es decir, los valores de u(oa = 1) y u(ob = 1)). Además, en la figura 2 ilustramos un ejemplo de las estimaciones calculadas a través de ambos métodos, para un único conjunto de resultados de contratos. Representamos las estimaciones de probabilidad, ˆp(X), y la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), de la manera estándar como una elipse [1]. Es decir, ˆp(X) determina la posición del centro de la elipse, Cov(p(X)) define su tamaño y forma. Cabe destacar que si bien la elipse resultante del formalismo completo de Dirichlet refleja con precisión la verdadera distribución (cuyas muestras se representan como puntos), la calculada al utilizar múltiples distribuciones Beta independientes (y por lo tanto ignorando las correlaciones) resulta en una elipse mucho más grande que no refleja la verdadera distribución. El tamaño más grande de esta elipse es resultado de que los términos fuera de la diagonal de la matriz de covarianza se establecieron en cero, y corresponde a que el agente calculó erróneamente la incertidumbre en la probabilidad de que se cumpla cada dimensión del contrato. Esto, a su vez, hace que se calcule de forma incorrecta la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada de un contrato (mostrada en la figura 1 como Var(E[U]). 5. COMUNICANDO REPUTACIÓN Habiendo descrito cómo un agente individual puede utilizar su propia experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para estimar la probabilidad. Nota que las gráficas no son suaves debido al hecho de que, dado un número limitado de resultados de contratos, la media de Va y Vb no varía suavemente con ρ. 1074 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), ahora pasamos a considerar cómo los agentes dentro de un sistema multiagente abierto pueden comunicar estas estimaciones entre sí. Esto se conoce comúnmente como reputación y permite a los agentes con experiencia directa limitada de un proveedor tomar decisiones racionales. Tanto Jøsang e Ismail, como Teacy y colaboradores, presentan modelos en los que la reputación se comunica entre agentes utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta [6, 11]. Este enfoque es atractivo ya que estas estadísticas suficientes son simples agregaciones de los resultados de los contratos (más precisamente, simplemente son el número total de contratos observados, N, y el número de estos que se cumplieron exitosamente, n). Bajo el marco probabilístico de la distribución beta, los informes de reputación en esta forma simplemente pueden ser agregados con la propia experiencia directa de un agente, con el fin de obtener una estimación más precisa basada en un conjunto más amplio de resultados de contratos. Podemos extender inmediatamente este enfoque al caso multidimensional considerado aquí, al requerir que los agentes intercambien las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet en lugar de la distribución beta. En este caso, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), los agentes deben comunicar un vector de resultados de contrato, N, que son las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet, dadas por: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Por lo tanto, un agente puede comunicar las estadísticas suficientes de su propia distribución de Dirichlet en términos de solo 2d(d − 1) números (donde d es el número de dimensiones de contrato). Por ejemplo, en el caso de tres dimensiones, N, se da por: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > y, por lo tanto, conjuntos grandes de resultados de contratos pueden ser comunicados dentro de un tamaño de mensaje relativamente pequeño, sin pérdida de información. Una vez más, los agentes que reciben estas estadísticas suficientes pueden simplemente agregarlas a su propia experiencia directa para obtener una estimación más precisa de la confiabilidad de un proveedor. Finalmente, cabe destacar que si bien no es el enfoque de nuestro trabajo aquí, al adoptar el mismo enfoque basado en principios que Jøsang e Ismail, y Teacy y otros, muchas de las técnicas que han desarrollado (como descontar informes de agentes no confiables y filtrar informes inconsistentes de agentes egoístas) pueden aplicarse directamente dentro de este modelo multidimensional. Sin embargo, ahora pasamos a considerar un nuevo problema que surge tanto en los modelos unidimensionales como multidimensionales, a saber, los problemas que surgen cuando dichas estadísticas suficientes agregadas se propagan dentro de redes de agentes descentralizados. 6. PROPAGACIÓN DE RUMORES DENTRO DE SISTEMAS DE REPUTACIÓN En la sección anterior, describimos el uso de estadísticas suficientes para comunicar la reputación, y demostramos que al agregar los resultados de los contratos en estas estadísticas suficientes, se puede representar y comunicar un gran número de resultados de contratos de forma compacta. Si bien esta es una propiedad atractiva, puede ser problemática en la práctica, ya que la procedencia individual de cada resultado de contrato se pierde en la agregación. Por lo tanto, para garantizar una estimación precisa, el sistema de reputación debe asegurarse de que cada observación de un resultado de contrato se incluya en las estadísticas agregadas no más de una vez. Dentro de un sistema de reputación centralizado, donde todos los agentes informan sus experiencias directas a un centro de confianza, es fácil evitar el doble conteo de resultados de contratos. Sin embargo, en un sistema de reputación descentralizado, donde los agentes comunican la reputación entre sí y agregan su experiencia directa con estos informes de reputación sobre la marcha, evitar el doble conteo es mucho más difícil. Por ejemplo, considera el caso mostrado en la figura 3 donde tres agentes (a1 . . . a3), cada uno con cierta experiencia directa de un proveedor, comparten informes de reputación sobre este proveedor. Si el agente a1 proporcionara su estimación a los agentes a2 y a3 en forma de las estadísticas suficientes de su distribución de Dirichlet, entonces estos agentes pueden agregar estos resultados contractuales con los suyos propios, y así obtener estimaciones más precisas. Si en una etapa posterior, el agente a2 enviara su vector agregado de resultados de contratos al agente a3, entonces el agente a3, al no estar al tanto de toda la historia de intercambios, podría intentar combinar estos resultados de contratos con su propio vector agregado. Sin embargo, dado que ambos vectores contienen una contribución del agente a1, estos serán contados dos veces en el vector agregado final, lo que resultará en una estimación sesgada y excesivamente confiada. Esto se denomina propagación de rumores o incesto de datos en la literatura de fusión de datos [9]. Una posible solución sería identificar de manera única la fuente de cada resultado de contrato, y luego propagar cada vector, junto con su etiqueta, a través de la red. Los agentes pueden identificar así observaciones idénticas que han llegado por diferentes rutas, y después de eliminar los duplicados, pueden agregarlos juntos para formar sus estimaciones. Si bien esto parece atractivo en principio, por varias razones, no siempre es una solución viable en la práctica [12]. En primer lugar, los agentes pueden no desear que sus resultados de contrato etiquetados de manera única se compartan en un sistema abierto, ya que dicha información puede tener importancia comercial o práctica que podría ser utilizada en su contra. Por lo tanto, es posible que los agentes solo estén dispuestos a intercambiar resultados de contratos identificables con un pequeño número de otros agentes (quizás aquellos con los que tengan algún tipo de relación recíproca). En segundo lugar, el hecho de que no haya una agregación de los resultados del contrato a medida que circulan por la red significa que el tamaño del mensaje aumenta con el tiempo, y el tamaño final de estos mensajes está limitado únicamente por el número de agentes dentro del sistema (posiblemente un número extremadamente grande para un sistema global). Finalmente, puede resultar realmente difícil asignar etiquetas globalmente aceptables, consistentes y únicas para cada agente dentro de un sistema abierto. En la siguiente sección, desarrollamos una solución novedosa al problema de la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Nuestra solución se basa en un enfoque desarrollado dentro del área de seguimiento de objetivos y fusión de datos [9]. Evita la necesidad de identificar de forma única a un agente, permite a los agentes restringir la cantidad de otros agentes a los que revelan sus estimaciones privadas, y aún así permite que la información se propague por toda la red. 6.1 Información Privada y Compartida Nuestra solución para la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados introduce la noción de información privada que un agente sabe que no ha comunicado a ningún otro agente, y de información compartida que ha sido comunicada a, o recibida de, otro agente. Por lo tanto, el agente puede descomponer su vector de resultado de contrato, N, en dos vectores, uno privado, Np, que no ha sido comunicado a otro agente, y uno compartido, Ns, que ha sido compartido con, o recibido de, otro agente: N = Np + Ns (19). Ahora, cada vez que un agente comunica la reputación, comunica ambos vectores privados y compartidos por separado. Ambos el origEl Sexto Intl. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), los agentes emisores y receptores actualizan sus dos vectores de manera apropiada. Para entender esto, considera el caso en el que el agente aα envía sus vectores de resultados de contrato privados y compartidos, Nα p y Nα s, al agente aβ que a su vez tiene resultados de contrato privados y compartidos Nβ p y Nβ s. Cada agente actualiza sus vectores de resultados de contrato de acuerdo con el siguiente procedimiento: • Agente de origen: Una vez que el agente de origen ha enviado tanto sus vectores de resultados de contrato compartidos como privados a otro agente, su información privada ya no es privada. Por lo tanto, debe eliminar los resultados de contrato que estaban en su vector privado y agregarlos a su vector compartido: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Agente Receptor: El objetivo del agente receptor es acumular el mayor número de resultados de contrato (ya que esto resultará en la estimación más precisa) sin incluir información compartida tanto de sí mismo como del otro agente (ya que esto podría resultar en la duplicación de resultados de contrato). Tiene dos opciones dependiendo del número total de resultados de contrato dentro de su propio vector compartido, Nβ s , y dentro del del agente de origen, Nα s. Así, actualiza su vector de acuerdo con el procedimiento siguiente: - Nβ s > Nα s: Si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un mayor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente combina su vector compartido con el vector privado del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. - Nβ s < Nα s: Alternativamente, si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un menor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente receptor descarta su propio vector compartido y forma uno nuevo a partir de los vectores privado y compartido del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. En caso de que Nβ s = Nα s, entonces cualquiera de las opciones es apropiada. Una vez que el agente receptor ha actualizado sus conjuntos, utiliza los resultados del contrato en ambos para formar su estimación de confianza. Si los agentes reciben varios vectores simultáneamente, este enfoque se generaliza al agente receptor utilizando el vector compartido más grande, y los vectores privados de sí mismo y de todos los agentes originales para formar su nuevo vector compartido. Este procedimiento tiene varias propiedades atractivas. En primer lugar, dado que los resultados de los contratos en un vector compartido de agentes nunca se combinan con los de otro agente en el vector compartido, los resultados que provienen del mismo agente nunca se combinan entre sí, y por lo tanto, la propagación de rumores se evita por completo. Sin embargo, dado que el agente receptor puede descartar su propio vector compartido y adoptar el vector compartido del agente de origen, la información sigue propagándose por la red. Además, dado que los resultados de los contratos se agregan juntos dentro de los vectores privados y compartidos, el tamaño del mensaje es constante y no aumenta a medida que aumenta el número de interacciones. Finalmente, un agente solo comunica los resultados de su propio contrato privado a sus vecinos inmediatos. Si este agente 6 lo transmite posteriormente, lo hace como información agregada no identificable dentro de su información compartida. Por lo tanto, un agente puede limitar el número de agentes con los que está dispuesto a revelar resultados de contratos identificables, y sin embargo, estos resultados de contratos aún pueden propagarse dentro de la red, y así mejorar las estimaciones de otros agentes. A continuación, demostramos empíricamente que estas propiedades pueden ser realizadas en la práctica. 6.2 Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de este procedimiento, simulamos redes aleatorias compuestas por diez agentes. Cada agente tiene cierta experiencia directa de interactuar con un proveedor (como se describe en la sección 4.3). En cada iteración de la simulación, interactúa con sus vecinos inmediatos y intercambia informes de reputación a través de las estadísticas suficientes de sus distribuciones de Dirichlet. Comparamos nuestra solución con dos de las alternativas descentralizadas más obvias: • Información Privada y Compartida: Los agentes siguen el procedimiento descrito en la sección anterior. Es decir, mantienen vectores separados privados y compartidos de resultados de contrato, y en cada iteración comunican ambos vectores a sus vecinos inmediatos. • Propagación de rumores: Los agentes no diferencian entre resultados de contrato privados y compartidos. En la primera iteración comunican todos los resultados del contrato que constituyen su experiencia directa. En iteraciones posteriores, propagan los resultados de los contratos que reciben de cualquiera de los vecinos a todos sus otros vecinos inmediatos. • Solo Información Privada: Los agentes solo comunican los resultados de los contratos que constituyen su experiencia directa. En todos los casos, en cada iteración, los agentes utilizan la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular sus estimaciones de confianza. Comparamos estos tres enfoques descentralizados con un sistema de reputación centralizado: • Reputación Centralizada: Todos los agentes transmiten su experiencia directa a un sistema de reputación centralizado que las agrega y devuelve esta estimación a cada agente. Esta solución centralizada hace el uso más efectivo de la información disponible en la red. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los problemas del mundo real requieren soluciones descentralizadas debido a preocupaciones de escalabilidad, modularidad y comunicación. Por lo tanto, esta solución centralizada se incluye ya que representa el caso óptimo, y nos permite comparar nuestra solución descentralizada. Los resultados de estas comparaciones se muestran en la figura 4. Aquí mostramos la suma del contenido de información de la matriz de covarianza de cada agente (calculada como se discutió anteriormente en la sección 4.3), para cada uno de estos cuatro enfoques diferentes. Primero observamos que cuando solo se comunica información privada, no hay cambio en la información después de la primera iteración. Una vez que cada agente ha recibido la experiencia directa de sus vecinos inmediatos, no se puede lograr un aumento adicional en la información. Esto representa la comunicación mínima y exhibe la menor cantidad total de información de los cuatro casos. A continuación, observamos que en el caso de la propagación de rumores, el contenido de la información aumenta continuamente y supera rápidamente el resultado de la reputación centralizada. El hecho de que el caso de propagación de rumores exceda incorrectamente este límite indica que está contando continuamente los mismos resultados de contrato a medida que circulan por la red, creyendo que son eventos independientes. Finalmente, observamos que el uso de información privada y compartida representa un compromiso entre el caso de solo información privada y el caso de reputación centralizada. La información todavía se permite propagar por la red, sin embargo los rumores son eliminados. Como antes, también representamos una única instancia de las estimaciones de confianza de un agente (es decir, ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X))) como un conjunto de elipses en un 1076 The Sixth Intl.

Como era de esperar, el sistema de reputación centralizado logra la mejor estimación de la distribución real, ya que utiliza la experiencia directa de todos los agentes. El caso de información privada muestra la elipse más grande ya que propaga la menor cantidad de información alrededor de la red. El caso de propagación de rumores muestra la elipse más pequeña, pero es inconsistente con la distribución real p(X). Por lo tanto, propagar rumores en la red y contar dos veces los resultados de los contratos creyendo que son eventos independientes, resulta en una estimación excesivamente confiada. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución, utilizando vectores separados de información privada y compartida, nos permite propagar más información que en el caso de solo información privada, pero evitamos por completo los problemas de propagación de rumores. Finalmente, consideramos el efecto que esto tiene en el cálculo del valor esperado de utilidad del contrato por parte de los agentes. Suponemos la misma función de utilidad que se utilizó en la sección 4.3 (es decir, u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2), y en la tabla 1 presentamos la estimación de la utilidad esperada y su desviación estándar calculada para los cuatro casos por un único agente en la quinta iteración (después de que la comunicación haya dejado de tener efecto adicional para todos los métodos excepto la propagación de rumores). Observamos que el caso de propagación de rumores es claramente inconsistente con el sistema de reputación centralizado, ya que su desviación estándar es demasiado pequeña y no refleja la verdadera incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada, dadas las consecuencias del contrato. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución representa el caso más cercano al sistema de reputación centralizado, y por lo tanto logra propagar la información a lo largo de la red, evitando al mismo tiempo el sesgo y la sobreconfianza. La diferencia exacta entre esto y el sistema de reputación centralizado depende de la topología de la red y de la historia de intercambios que tienen lugar dentro de ella. 7. CONCLUSIONES En este artículo abordamos la necesidad de un modelo probabilístico fundamentado de confianza computacional que maneje contratos con múltiples dimensiones correlacionadas. Nuestro punto de partida fue un agente que estimaba la utilidad esperada de un contrato, y demostramos que esto conduce a un modelo de confianza computacional que utiliza la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular una estimación de confianza a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente. Luego mostramos cómo los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para representar y comunicar la reputación dentro de un sistema de reputación descentralizado, y presentamos una solución a la propagación de rumores dentro de estos sistemas. Nuestro trabajo futuro en esta área es extender el intercambio de reputación al caso en el que los contratos no son homogéneos. Es decir, no todos los agentes observan las mismas dimensiones del contrato. Esta es una extensión desafiante, ya que en este caso, las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet no pueden ser utilizadas directamente.

Abordando este desafío, esperamos poder aplicar estas técnicas a un escenario en el que un proveedor ofrece una variedad de servicios cuyas fallas están correlacionadas, y los agentes solo tienen experiencias directas de diferentes subconjuntos de estos servicios. 8.

                "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",

                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",

                "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",

INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Él desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5]. Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión. Jøsang e Ismail describen el Sistema de Reputación Beta, en el cual la reputación de un agente se compila a partir de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6]. La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio fundamentado para representar la incertidumbre. Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluyen un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descontar las opiniones de agentes que tienen calificaciones de reputación bajas, y técnicas para manejar reputaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo. Asimismo, Teacy et al. utilizan la distribución beta para describir la creencia de un agente en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla exitosamente con sus compromisos [11]. Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad basándose en su experiencia directa, y nuevamente utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes. Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial, y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan con veracidad sus estimaciones de confianza. Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque basado en principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes. Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más fundamentados. Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato. En el caso unidimensional, esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.). Sin embargo, luego pasamos a extender este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, es decir, la distribución de Dirichlet, para representar la creencia de los agentes sobre múltiples dimensiones. 3. CONFIANZA UNIDIMENSIONAL Antes de presentar nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional, primero introducimos la notación y el formalismo que utilizaremos describiendo el caso más familiar unidimensional. Consideramos a un agente que debe decidir si comprometerse en un contrato futuro con un proveedor. Este contrato llevará a algún resultado, o, y consideramos que o = 1 si el contrato se cumple con éxito, y o = 0 si no. Para que el agente pueda tomar una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Suponemos que en caso de que el contrato se cumpla con éxito, el agente obtiene una utilidad u(o = 1), de lo contrario no recibe ninguna utilidad. Ahora, dado que el agente no está seguro de la fiabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá el contrato, debería considerar la utilidad esperada que obtendrá, E[U], y esto se da por: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) donde p(o = 1) es la probabilidad de que el proveedor cumpla exitosamente con el contrato. Sin embargo, aunque el agente conoce u(o = 1), no conoce p(o = 1). Lo mejor que el agente puede hacer es determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1) dados sus experiencias directas de resultados de contratos anteriores. Dado que ha sido capaz de hacerlo, puede entonces determinar una estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, E[E[U]], y una medida de su incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada, Var(E[U]). Esta incertidumbre es importante ya que un agente adverso al riesgo puede tomar una decisión con respecto a un contrato. Nota que solo consideramos resultados de contratos binarios, aunque extender esto a resultados parciales es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro. Claramente esto puede extenderse al caso en el que se derive cierta utilidad de un resultado no exitoso. Nota que esto a menudo se llama la utilidad esperada esperada, y esta es la notación que adoptamos aquí. El Sexto Internacional. La Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) no solo se basa en su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, sino también en la probabilidad de que la utilidad esperada supere cierta cantidad mínima. Estas dos propiedades se dan por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) donde ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) son la estimación y la incertidumbre de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, y se calculan a partir de la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) que el agente determina a partir de su experiencia directa. El enfoque basado en utilidad que presentamos aquí proporciona una motivación atractiva para este modelo de Teacy et al. [11]. Ahora, en el caso de resultados de contratos binarios, la distribución beta es la elección natural para representar la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) ya que dentro de la estadística bayesiana se sabe que es la distribución previa conjugada para observaciones binomiales [3]. Al adoptar la distribución beta, podemos calcular ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) utilizando resultados estándar, y así, si un agente observó N contratos anteriores de los cuales n se cumplieron con éxito, entonces: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 y: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Tenga en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuanto mayor sea el número de contratos que el agente observa, menor será el término de varianza Var(p(o = 1)), y, por lo tanto, menor será la incertidumbre con respecto a la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1). CONFIANZA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL Ahora extendemos la descripción anterior para considerar contratos entre proveedores y agentes que están representados por múltiples dimensiones, por lo que el éxito o fracaso de un contrato puede descomponerse en el éxito o fracaso de cada dimensión por separado. Considera nuevamente el ejemplo de la cadena de suministro que especifica la puntualidad, cantidad y calidad de los bienes que deben ser entregados. Por lo tanto, dentro de nuestro modelo de confianza, oa = 1 ahora indica un resultado exitoso sobre la dimensión a del contrato y oa = 0 indica uno no exitoso. Un resultado de contrato, X, está compuesto ahora por un vector de resultados de partes individuales del contrato (por ejemplo, X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . . }). Dado un contrato multidimensional cuyo resultado está descrito por el vector X, consideramos nuevamente que para que un agente tome una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Con este fin, podemos hacer la afirmación general de que la utilidad esperada de un contrato se da por: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) donde p(X) es una distribución conjunta de probabilidad sobre todos los posibles resultados del contrato: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) y U(X) es la utilidad derivada de estos posibles resultados: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) Como antes, mientras que U(X) es conocido por el agente, la distribución de probabilidad p(X) no lo es. Más bien, dada la experiencia directa de los agentes con el proveedor, el agente puede determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(X). En el caso unidimensional, una distribución beta fue la elección natural sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1). En el caso multi-dimensional, donde p(X) en sí mismo es un vector de probabilidades, la elección natural correspondiente es la distribución de Dirichlet, ya que esta es una distribución previa conjugada para proporciones multinomiales [3]. Dada esta distribución, el agente puede calcular una estimación de la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Como antes, esta estimación está representada por un valor esperado dado por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) y una varianza, que describe la incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) donde: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Así, mientras que el caso unidimensional naturalmente conduce a un modelo de confianza en el que los agentes intentan derivar una estimación de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1), junto con una varianza escalar que describe la incertidumbre en esta probabilidad, Var(p(o = 1)), en este caso, los agentes deben derivar una estimación de un vector de probabilidades, ˆp(X), junto con una matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), que representa la incertidumbre en p(X) dadas las consecuencias contractuales observadas. En este punto, es interesante notar que la estimación en el caso unidimensional, ˆp(o = 1), tiene un claro significado semántico en relación con la confianza; es la creencia de los agentes en la probabilidad de que un proveedor cumpla exitosamente un contrato. Sin embargo, en el caso multidimensional, el agente debe determinar ˆp(X), y dado que esto describe la probabilidad de todos los posibles resultados del contrato, incluidos aquellos que no se cumplen en absoluto, esta interpretación semántica directa no está presente. En la siguiente sección, describimos la función de utilidad ejemplar que utilizaremos en el resto de este documento. 4.1 Función de Utilidad Ejemplar El enfoque descrito hasta ahora es completamente general, ya que se aplica a cualquier función de utilidad del tipo descrito anteriormente, y también se aplica a la estimación de cualquier distribución de probabilidad conjunta. En el resto de este documento, con fines ilustrativos, limitaremos la discusión a la función de utilidad más simple posible que muestre una dependencia de las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Es decir, consideramos el caso en el que la utilidad esperada depende solo de las probabilidades marginales de que se cumpla exitosamente cada dimensión del contrato, en lugar de las probabilidades conjuntas completas: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Por lo tanto, ˆp(X) es una estimación vectorial de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se cumpla exitosamente, y mantiene la clara interpretación semántica vista en el caso unidimensional: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) Las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato afectan la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada. Para ver esto, considera la covarianza 1072 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. La matriz que describe esta incertidumbre, Cov(p(X)), en la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se da ahora por: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . . I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab Vb Cbc . . .\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for translation? En esta matriz, los términos diagonales, Va, Vb y Vc, representan las incertidumbres en p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) y p(oc = 1) dentro de p(X). Los términos fuera de la diagonal, Cab, Cac y Cbc, representan las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades. En la siguiente sección, utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular tanto ˆp(X) como Cov(p(X)) a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente en los resultados de contratos anteriores. Primero ilustramos por qué esto es necesario considerando un enfoque alternativo para modelar contratos multidimensionales, en el cual un agente asume ingenuamente que las dimensiones son independientes, y por lo tanto, modela cada una individualmente mediante distribuciones beta separadas (como en el caso unidimensional que presentamos en la sección 3). Esto es en realidad equivalente a establecer los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), a cero. Sin embargo, hacerlo puede llevar a un agente a asumir que su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato es más precisa de lo que en realidad es. Para ilustrar esto, considera un escenario específico con los siguientes valores: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 y Va = Vb = 0.2. En este caso, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), y por lo tanto, si se ignora la <br>correlación</br> Cab, la varianza en la utilidad esperada es de 0.4. Sin embargo, si los resultados del contrato están completamente correlacionados, entonces Cab = 1 y Var(E[U]) es en realidad 0.8. Por lo tanto, para tener una estimación precisa de la varianza de la utilidad del contrato esperada, y para tomar una decisión racional, es esencial que el agente sea capaz de representar y calcular estos <br>términos de correlación</br>. En la siguiente sección, describimos cómo un agente puede hacerlo utilizando la distribución de Dirichlet. 4.2 La Distribución de Dirichlet En esta sección, describimos cómo el agente puede utilizar su experiencia directa de contratos anteriores y los resultados estándar de la distribución de Dirichlet para determinar una estimación de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato sea cumplida exitosamente, ˆp(X), y una medida de las incertidumbres en estas probabilidades que expresa las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato, Cov(p(X)). Primero consideramos el cálculo de ˆp(X) y los términos diagonales de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)). Como se describe arriba, la derivación de estos resultados es idéntica al caso de la distribución beta unidimensional, donde de N resultados de contratos, n se cumplen exitosamente. En el caso multi-dimensional, sin embargo, tenemos un vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} que representa el número de resultados para los cuales se cumplieron con éxito cada una de las dimensiones individuales del contrato. Por lo tanto, en términos de los parámetros estándar de Dirichlet donde αa = na + 1 y α0 = N + 2, el agente puede estimar la probabilidad de que esta dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 y también puede calcular la varianza en cualquier dimensión del contrato: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Sin embargo, calcular los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de Cov(p(X)) es más complejo ya que es necesario considerar las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Por lo tanto, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), debemos considerar todas las posibles combinaciones de resultados de contrato, y así definimos nab ij como el número de resultados de contrato para los cuales tanto oa = i como ob = j. Por ejemplo, nab 10 representa el número de contratos para los cuales oa = 1 y ob = 0. Ahora, utilizando la notación estándar de Dirichlet, podemos definir αab ij nab ij + 1 para todos los i y j que toman valores 0 y 1, y luego, para calcular las correlaciones cruzadas entre los pares de contratos a y b, observamos que la distribución de Dirichlet sobre las probabilidades conjuntas par a par es: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 donde: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 y Kab es una constante de normalización [3]. A partir de esto podemos derivar estimaciones de probabilidad y varianzas por pares: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) donde: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) y de hecho, α0 = N + 2, donde N es el número total de contratos observados. Asimismo, podemos expresar la covarianza en estas probabilidades por pares en términos similares: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0). Finalmente, podemos utilizar la expresión: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) para determinar la covarianza Cab. Para hacerlo, primero simplificamos la notación definiendo V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] y Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)]. La covarianza para la probabilidad de resultados positivos de contrato es entonces la covarianza entre j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) e i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), y por lo tanto: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11. Por lo tanto, dado un conjunto de resultados de contratos que representan las interacciones previas de los agentes con un proveedor, podemos utilizar la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular la media y la varianza de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato (es decir, ˆp(oa = 1) y Va). Además, mediante un procedimiento algo más complejo también podemos calcular las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades (es decir, ... I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab).\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for me to translate to Spanish? Esto nos permite calcular una estimación de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato, ˆp(X), y también representar la incertidumbre y correlaciones en estas probabilidades mediante la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)). A su vez, estos resultados pueden ser utilizados para calcular la estimación y la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada del contrato. En la siguiente sección presentamos resultados empíricos que muestran que en la práctica este formalismo produce mejoras significativas en estas estimaciones en comparación con la aproximación ingenua que utiliza múltiples distribuciones beta independientes. Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de nuestro formalismo y mostrar la importancia de los términos fuera de la diagonal en Cov(p(X)), comparamos dos enfoques: La Sexta Conferencia Internacional.

Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones, y las barras de error muestran el error estándar en la media. • Distribución de Dirichlet: Utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet completa, como se describe arriba, para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), incluyendo todos sus términos fuera de la diagonal que representan las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. • Distribuciones Beta Independientes: Utilizamos distribuciones beta independientes para representar cada dimensión del contrato, con el fin de calcular ˆp(X), y luego, como se describió anteriormente, aproximamos Cov(p(X)) e ignoramos las correlaciones al establecer todos los términos fuera de la diagonal en cero. Consideramos un caso bidimensional donde u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2, ya que esto nos permite trazar ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) como elipses en un plano bidimensional, y así explicar las diferencias entre los dos enfoques. Específicamente, inicialmente asignamos al agente algunos resultados de contratos anteriores que representan su experiencia directa con un proveedor. El número de contratos se elige de forma uniforme entre 10 y 20, y los resultados reales de los contratos se eligen de una distribución conjunta arbitraria destinada a inducir correlaciones entre las dimensiones de los contratos. Para cada conjunto de contratos, utilizamos los enfoques descritos anteriormente para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), y por lo tanto, la varianza en la utilidad esperada del contrato, Var(E[U]). Además, calculamos una medida escalar del contenido de información, I, de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)), que es una forma estándar de medir la incertidumbre codificada dentro de la matriz de covarianza [1]. Más específicamente, calculamos el determinante de la inversa de la matriz de covarianza: I = det(Cov(p(X))−1 ) (16) y observamos que cuanto mayor sea el contenido de información, más precisa será ˆp(X), y por lo tanto, mejor será la estimación de la utilidad esperada que el agente puede calcular.

                "This approach is attractive since these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of contracts observed, N, and the number of these that were successfully fulfilled, n).",
                "Under the probabilistic framework of the beta distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agents own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.",
                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",
                "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",
                "For instance, in the case of three dimensions, N, is given by: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information.",
                "Again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier.",
                "Finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here, by adopting the same principled approach as Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within this multi-dimensional model.",
                "However, we now go on to consider a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks. 6.",
                "RUMOUR PROPAGATION WITHIN REPUTATION SYSTEMS In the previous section, we described the use of sufficient statistics to communicate reputation, and we showed that by aggregating contract outcomes together into these sufficient statistics, a large number of contract outcomes can be represented and communicated in a compact form.",
                "Whilst, this is an attractive property, it can be problematic in practise, since the individual provenance of each contract outcome is lost in the aggregation.",
                "Thus, to ensure an accurate estimate, the reputation system must ensure that each observation of a contract outcome is included within the aggregated statistics no more than once.",
                "Within a centralised reputation system, where all agents report their direct experience to a trusted center, such double counting of contract outcomes is easy to avoid.",
                "However, in a decentralised reputation system, where agents communicate reputation to one another, and aggregate their direct experience with these reputation reports on-the-fly, avoiding double counting is much more difficult. a1 a2 a3 ¨ ¨¨ ¨¨ ¨¨B E T N1 N1 N1 + N2 Figure 3: Example of rumour propagation in a decentralised reputation system.",
                "For example, consider the case shown in figure 3 where three agents (a1 . . . a3), each with some direct experience of a supplier, share reputation reports regarding this supplier.",
                "If agent a1 were to provide its estimate to agents a2 and a3 in the form of the sufficient statistics of its Dirichlet distribution, then these agents can aggregate these contract outcomes with their own, and thus obtain more precise estimates.",
                "If at a later stage, agent a2 were to send its aggregate vector of contract outcomes to agent a3, then agent a3 being unaware of the full history of exchanges, may attempt to combine these contract outcomes with its own aggregated vector.",
                "However, since both vectors contain a contribution from agent a1, these will be counted twice in the final aggregated vector, and will result in a biased and overconfident estimate.",
                "This is termed rumour propagation or data incest in the data fusion literature [9].",
                "One possible solution would be to uniquely identify the source of each contract outcome, and then propagate each vector, along with its label, through the network.",
                "Agents can thus identify identical observations that have arrived through different routes, and after removing the duplicates, can aggregate these together to form their estimates.",
                "Whilst this appears to be attractive in principle, for a number of reasons, it is not always a viable solution in practise [12].",
                "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
                "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",
                "Finally, it may actually be difficult to assign globally agreeable, consistent, and unique labels for each agent within an open system.",
                "In the next section, we develop a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems.",
                "Our solution is based on an approach developed within the area of target tracking and data fusion [9].",
                "It avoids the need to uniquely identify an agent, it allows agents to restrict the number of other agents who they reveal their private estimates to, and yet it still allows information to propagate throughout the network. 6.1 Private and Shared Information Our solution to rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems introduces the notion of private information that an agent knows it has not communicated to any other agent, and shared information that has been communicated to, or received from, another agent.",
                "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
                "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
                "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",

                "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
                "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
                "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
                "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",

                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
                "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",
                "The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4.",

                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
                "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
                "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",

                "Under the probabilistic framework of the beta distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agents own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.",
                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the <br>dirichlet distribution</br> instead of the beta distribution.",
                "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the <br>dirichlet distribution</br>, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own <br>dirichlet distribution</br> in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",
                "For instance, in the case of three dimensions, N, is given by: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information.",
                "Again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier.",
                "Finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here, by adopting the same principled approach as Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within this multi-dimensional model.",
                "However, we now go on to consider a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks. 6.",

                "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",

                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",

                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",

                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",

                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",

                "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",

                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",

Finalmente, presentamos una solución novedosa al problema de la propagación de rumores dentro de tales sistemas. Esta solución utiliza la noción de información privada y compartida, y proporciona estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando el sesgo y la sobreconfianza.

INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la <br>distribución de Dirichlet</br> que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta <br>distribución de Dirichlet</br> para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Él desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5]. Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión. Jøsang e Ismail describen el Sistema de Reputación Beta, en el cual la reputación de un agente se compila a partir de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6]. La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio fundamentado para representar la incertidumbre. Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluyen un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descontar las opiniones de agentes que tienen calificaciones de reputación bajas, y técnicas para manejar reputaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo. Asimismo, Teacy et al. utilizan la distribución beta para describir la creencia de un agente en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla exitosamente con sus compromisos [11]. Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad basándose en su experiencia directa, y nuevamente utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes. Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial, y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan con veracidad sus estimaciones de confianza. Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque basado en principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes. Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más fundamentados. Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato. En el caso unidimensional, esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.). Sin embargo, luego pasamos a extender este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, es decir, la <br>distribución de Dirichlet</br>, para representar la creencia de los agentes sobre múltiples dimensiones. 3.

                "Rather, given the agents direct experience of the supplier, the agent can determine a distribution over possible values for p(X).",
                "In the single dimensional case, a beta distribution was the natural choice over possible values of p(o = 1).",
                "In the multi-dimensional case, where p(X) itself is a vector of probabilities, the corresponding natural choice is the Dirichlet distribution, since this is a conjugate prior for multinomial proportions [3].",
                "Given this distribution, the agent is then able to calculate an estimate of the expected utility of a contract.",
                "As before, this estimate is itself represented by an expected value given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) and a variance, describing the uncertainty in this expected utility: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) where: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Thus, whilst the single dimensional case naturally leads to a trust model in which the agents attempt to derive an estimate of probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1), along with a scalar variance that describes the uncertainty in this probability, Var(p(o = 1)), in this case, the agents must derive an estimate of a vector of probabilities, ˆp(X), along with a covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), that represents the uncertainty in p(X) given the observed contractual outcomes.",
                "At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract.",
                "However, in the multi-dimensional case the agent must determine ˆp(X), and since this describes the probability of all possible contract outcomes, including those that are completely un-fulfilled, this direct semantic interpretation is not present.",

INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la <br>doble contabilización</br> y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Él desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5]. Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión. Jøsang e Ismail describen el Sistema de Reputación Beta, en el cual la reputación de un agente se compila a partir de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6]. La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio fundamentado para representar la incertidumbre. Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluyen un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descontar las opiniones de agentes que tienen calificaciones de reputación bajas, y técnicas para manejar reputaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo. Asimismo, Teacy et al. utilizan la distribución beta para describir la creencia de un agente en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla exitosamente con sus compromisos [11]. Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad basándose en su experiencia directa, y nuevamente utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes. Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial, y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan con veracidad sus estimaciones de confianza. Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque basado en principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes. Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más fundamentados. Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato. En el caso unidimensional, esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.). Sin embargo, luego pasamos a extender este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, es decir, la distribución de Dirichlet, para representar la creencia de los agentes sobre múltiples dimensiones. 3. CONFIANZA UNIDIMENSIONAL Antes de presentar nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional, primero introducimos la notación y el formalismo que utilizaremos describiendo el caso más familiar unidimensional. Consideramos a un agente que debe decidir si comprometerse en un contrato futuro con un proveedor. Este contrato llevará a algún resultado, o, y consideramos que o = 1 si el contrato se cumple con éxito, y o = 0 si no. Para que el agente pueda tomar una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Suponemos que en caso de que el contrato se cumpla con éxito, el agente obtiene una utilidad u(o = 1), de lo contrario no recibe ninguna utilidad. Ahora, dado que el agente no está seguro de la fiabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá el contrato, debería considerar la utilidad esperada que obtendrá, E[U], y esto se da por: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) donde p(o = 1) es la probabilidad de que el proveedor cumpla exitosamente con el contrato. Sin embargo, aunque el agente conoce u(o = 1), no conoce p(o = 1). Lo mejor que el agente puede hacer es determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1) dados sus experiencias directas de resultados de contratos anteriores. Dado que ha sido capaz de hacerlo, puede entonces determinar una estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, E[E[U]], y una medida de su incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada, Var(E[U]). Esta incertidumbre es importante ya que un agente adverso al riesgo puede tomar una decisión con respecto a un contrato. Nota que solo consideramos resultados de contratos binarios, aunque extender esto a resultados parciales es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro. Claramente esto puede extenderse al caso en el que se derive cierta utilidad de un resultado no exitoso. Nota que esto a menudo se llama la utilidad esperada esperada, y esta es la notación que adoptamos aquí. El Sexto Internacional. La Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) no solo se basa en su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, sino también en la probabilidad de que la utilidad esperada supere cierta cantidad mínima. Estas dos propiedades se dan por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) donde ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) son la estimación y la incertidumbre de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, y se calculan a partir de la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) que el agente determina a partir de su experiencia directa. El enfoque basado en utilidad que presentamos aquí proporciona una motivación atractiva para este modelo de Teacy et al. [11]. Ahora, en el caso de resultados de contratos binarios, la distribución beta es la elección natural para representar la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) ya que dentro de la estadística bayesiana se sabe que es la distribución previa conjugada para observaciones binomiales [3]. Al adoptar la distribución beta, podemos calcular ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) utilizando resultados estándar, y así, si un agente observó N contratos anteriores de los cuales n se cumplieron con éxito, entonces: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 y: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Tenga en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuanto mayor sea el número de contratos que el agente observa, menor será el término de varianza Var(p(o = 1)), y, por lo tanto, menor será la incertidumbre con respecto a la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1). CONFIANZA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL Ahora extendemos la descripción anterior para considerar contratos entre proveedores y agentes que están representados por múltiples dimensiones, por lo que el éxito o fracaso de un contrato puede descomponerse en el éxito o fracaso de cada dimensión por separado. Considera nuevamente el ejemplo de la cadena de suministro que especifica la puntualidad, cantidad y calidad de los bienes que deben ser entregados. Por lo tanto, dentro de nuestro modelo de confianza, oa = 1 ahora indica un resultado exitoso sobre la dimensión a del contrato y oa = 0 indica uno no exitoso. Un resultado de contrato, X, está compuesto ahora por un vector de resultados de partes individuales del contrato (por ejemplo, X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . . }). Dado un contrato multidimensional cuyo resultado está descrito por el vector X, consideramos nuevamente que para que un agente tome una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Con este fin, podemos hacer la afirmación general de que la utilidad esperada de un contrato se da por: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) donde p(X) es una distribución conjunta de probabilidad sobre todos los posibles resultados del contrato: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) y U(X) es la utilidad derivada de estos posibles resultados: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) Como antes, mientras que U(X) es conocido por el agente, la distribución de probabilidad p(X) no lo es. Más bien, dada la experiencia directa de los agentes con el proveedor, el agente puede determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(X). En el caso unidimensional, una distribución beta fue la elección natural sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1). En el caso multi-dimensional, donde p(X) en sí mismo es un vector de probabilidades, la elección natural correspondiente es la distribución de Dirichlet, ya que esta es una distribución previa conjugada para proporciones multinomiales [3]. Dada esta distribución, el agente puede calcular una estimación de la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Como antes, esta estimación está representada por un valor esperado dado por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) y una varianza, que describe la incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) donde: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Así, mientras que el caso unidimensional naturalmente conduce a un modelo de confianza en el que los agentes intentan derivar una estimación de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1), junto con una varianza escalar que describe la incertidumbre en esta probabilidad, Var(p(o = 1)), en este caso, los agentes deben derivar una estimación de un vector de probabilidades, ˆp(X), junto con una matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), que representa la incertidumbre en p(X) dadas las consecuencias contractuales observadas. En este punto, es interesante notar que la estimación en el caso unidimensional, ˆp(o = 1), tiene un claro significado semántico en relación con la confianza; es la creencia de los agentes en la probabilidad de que un proveedor cumpla exitosamente un contrato. Sin embargo, en el caso multidimensional, el agente debe determinar ˆp(X), y dado que esto describe la probabilidad de todos los posibles resultados del contrato, incluidos aquellos que no se cumplen en absoluto, esta interpretación semántica directa no está presente. En la siguiente sección, describimos la función de utilidad ejemplar que utilizaremos en el resto de este documento. 4.1 Función de Utilidad Ejemplar El enfoque descrito hasta ahora es completamente general, ya que se aplica a cualquier función de utilidad del tipo descrito anteriormente, y también se aplica a la estimación de cualquier distribución de probabilidad conjunta. En el resto de este documento, con fines ilustrativos, limitaremos la discusión a la función de utilidad más simple posible que muestre una dependencia de las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Es decir, consideramos el caso en el que la utilidad esperada depende solo de las probabilidades marginales de que se cumpla exitosamente cada dimensión del contrato, en lugar de las probabilidades conjuntas completas: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Por lo tanto, ˆp(X) es una estimación vectorial de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se cumpla exitosamente, y mantiene la clara interpretación semántica vista en el caso unidimensional: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) Las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato afectan la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada. Para ver esto, considera la covarianza 1072 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. La matriz que describe esta incertidumbre, Cov(p(X)), en la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se da ahora por: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . . I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab Vb Cbc . . .\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for translation? En esta matriz, los términos diagonales, Va, Vb y Vc, representan las incertidumbres en p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) y p(oc = 1) dentro de p(X). Los términos fuera de la diagonal, Cab, Cac y Cbc, representan las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades. En la siguiente sección, utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular tanto ˆp(X) como Cov(p(X)) a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente en los resultados de contratos anteriores. Primero ilustramos por qué esto es necesario considerando un enfoque alternativo para modelar contratos multidimensionales, en el cual un agente asume ingenuamente que las dimensiones son independientes, y por lo tanto, modela cada una individualmente mediante distribuciones beta separadas (como en el caso unidimensional que presentamos en la sección 3). Esto es en realidad equivalente a establecer los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), a cero. Sin embargo, hacerlo puede llevar a un agente a asumir que su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato es más precisa de lo que en realidad es. Para ilustrar esto, considera un escenario específico con los siguientes valores: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 y Va = Vb = 0.2. En este caso, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), y por lo tanto, si se ignora la correlación Cab, la varianza en la utilidad esperada es de 0.4. Sin embargo, si los resultados del contrato están completamente correlacionados, entonces Cab = 1 y Var(E[U]) es en realidad 0.8. Por lo tanto, para tener una estimación precisa de la varianza de la utilidad del contrato esperada, y para tomar una decisión racional, es esencial que el agente sea capaz de representar y calcular estos términos de correlación. En la siguiente sección, describimos cómo un agente puede hacerlo utilizando la distribución de Dirichlet. 4.2 La Distribución de Dirichlet En esta sección, describimos cómo el agente puede utilizar su experiencia directa de contratos anteriores y los resultados estándar de la distribución de Dirichlet para determinar una estimación de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato sea cumplida exitosamente, ˆp(X), y una medida de las incertidumbres en estas probabilidades que expresa las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato, Cov(p(X)). Primero consideramos el cálculo de ˆp(X) y los términos diagonales de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)). Como se describe arriba, la derivación de estos resultados es idéntica al caso de la distribución beta unidimensional, donde de N resultados de contratos, n se cumplen exitosamente. En el caso multi-dimensional, sin embargo, tenemos un vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} que representa el número de resultados para los cuales se cumplieron con éxito cada una de las dimensiones individuales del contrato. Por lo tanto, en términos de los parámetros estándar de Dirichlet donde αa = na + 1 y α0 = N + 2, el agente puede estimar la probabilidad de que esta dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 y también puede calcular la varianza en cualquier dimensión del contrato: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Sin embargo, calcular los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de Cov(p(X)) es más complejo ya que es necesario considerar las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Por lo tanto, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), debemos considerar todas las posibles combinaciones de resultados de contrato, y así definimos nab ij como el número de resultados de contrato para los cuales tanto oa = i como ob = j. Por ejemplo, nab 10 representa el número de contratos para los cuales oa = 1 y ob = 0. Ahora, utilizando la notación estándar de Dirichlet, podemos definir αab ij nab ij + 1 para todos los i y j que toman valores 0 y 1, y luego, para calcular las correlaciones cruzadas entre los pares de contratos a y b, observamos que la distribución de Dirichlet sobre las probabilidades conjuntas par a par es: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 donde: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 y Kab es una constante de normalización [3]. A partir de esto podemos derivar estimaciones de probabilidad y varianzas por pares: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) donde: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) y de hecho, α0 = N + 2, donde N es el número total de contratos observados. Asimismo, podemos expresar la covarianza en estas probabilidades por pares en términos similares: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0). Finalmente, podemos utilizar la expresión: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) para determinar la covarianza Cab. Para hacerlo, primero simplificamos la notación definiendo V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] y Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)]. La covarianza para la probabilidad de resultados positivos de contrato es entonces la covarianza entre j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) e i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), y por lo tanto: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11. Por lo tanto, dado un conjunto de resultados de contratos que representan las interacciones previas de los agentes con un proveedor, podemos utilizar la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular la media y la varianza de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato (es decir, ˆp(oa = 1) y Va). Además, mediante un procedimiento algo más complejo también podemos calcular las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades (es decir, ... I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab).\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for me to translate to Spanish? Esto nos permite calcular una estimación de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato, ˆp(X), y también representar la incertidumbre y correlaciones en estas probabilidades mediante la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)). A su vez, estos resultados pueden ser utilizados para calcular la estimación y la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada del contrato. En la siguiente sección presentamos resultados empíricos que muestran que en la práctica este formalismo produce mejoras significativas en estas estimaciones en comparación con la aproximación ingenua que utiliza múltiples distribuciones beta independientes. Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de nuestro formalismo y mostrar la importancia de los términos fuera de la diagonal en Cov(p(X)), comparamos dos enfoques: La Sexta Conferencia Internacional. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) 1073 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Correlación (ρ) Var(E[U]) Distribución de Dirichlet Distribuciones Beta Independientes −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Correlación (ρ) Información(I) Distribución de Dirichlet Distribuciones Beta Independientes Figura 1: Gráficos que muestran (i) la varianza de la utilidad del contrato esperada y (ii) el contenido de información de las estimaciones calculadas utilizando la distribución de Dirichlet y múltiples distribuciones beta independientes. Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones, y las barras de error muestran el error estándar en la media. • Distribución de Dirichlet: Utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet completa, como se describe arriba, para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), incluyendo todos sus términos fuera de la diagonal que representan las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. • Distribuciones Beta Independientes: Utilizamos distribuciones beta independientes para representar cada dimensión del contrato, con el fin de calcular ˆp(X), y luego, como se describió anteriormente, aproximamos Cov(p(X)) e ignoramos las correlaciones al establecer todos los términos fuera de la diagonal en cero. Consideramos un caso bidimensional donde u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2, ya que esto nos permite trazar ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) como elipses en un plano bidimensional, y así explicar las diferencias entre los dos enfoques. Específicamente, inicialmente asignamos al agente algunos resultados de contratos anteriores que representan su experiencia directa con un proveedor. El número de contratos se elige de forma uniforme entre 10 y 20, y los resultados reales de los contratos se eligen de una distribución conjunta arbitraria destinada a inducir correlaciones entre las dimensiones de los contratos. Para cada conjunto de contratos, utilizamos los enfoques descritos anteriormente para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), y por lo tanto, la varianza en la utilidad esperada del contrato, Var(E[U]). Además, calculamos una medida escalar del contenido de información, I, de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)), que es una forma estándar de medir la incertidumbre codificada dentro de la matriz de covarianza [1]. Más específicamente, calculamos el determinante de la inversa de la matriz de covarianza: I = det(Cov(p(X))−1 ) (16) y observamos que cuanto mayor sea el contenido de información, más precisa será ˆp(X), y por lo tanto, mejor será la estimación de la utilidad esperada que el agente puede calcular. Finalmente, utilizamos los resultados 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 p(o =1) p(o=1) a b Distribución de Dirichlet Distribuciones Beta Independientes Figura 2: Ejemplos de ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) representados como elipses de segundo error estándar. presentados en la sección 4.2 para calcular la correlación real, ρ, asociada con este conjunto particular de resultados de contrato: ρ = Cab √ VaVb (17) donde Cab, Va y Vb se calculan como se describe en la sección 4.2. Los resultados de este análisis se muestran en la figura 1. Aquí mostramos los valores de I y Var(E[U]) calculados por los agentes, representados en función de la correlación de los resultados del contrato, ρ, que constituyeron su experiencia directa. Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones de simulación. Se debe tener en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuando las dimensiones de los resultados del contrato no están correlacionadas (es decir, ρ = 0), ambos enfoques dan los mismos resultados. Sin embargo, el valor de utilizar nuestro formalismo con la distribución de Dirichlet completa se muestra cuando la correlación entre las dimensiones aumenta (ya sea de forma negativa o positiva). Como se puede observar, si aproximamos la distribución de Dirichlet con múltiples distribuciones beta independientes, toda la información de correlación contenida en la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), se pierde, y por lo tanto, el contenido informativo de la matriz es mucho menor. La pérdida de esta información de correlación hace que la varianza de la utilidad esperada del contrato sea incorrecta (ya sea sobreestimada o subestimada dependiendo de la correlación), con la cantidad exacta de subestimación dependiendo de la función de utilidad real elegida (es decir, los valores de u(oa = 1) y u(ob = 1)). Además, en la figura 2 ilustramos un ejemplo de las estimaciones calculadas a través de ambos métodos, para un único conjunto de resultados de contratos. Representamos las estimaciones de probabilidad, ˆp(X), y la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), de la manera estándar como una elipse [1]. Es decir, ˆp(X) determina la posición del centro de la elipse, Cov(p(X)) define su tamaño y forma. Cabe destacar que si bien la elipse resultante del formalismo completo de Dirichlet refleja con precisión la verdadera distribución (cuyas muestras se representan como puntos), la calculada al utilizar múltiples distribuciones Beta independientes (y por lo tanto ignorando las correlaciones) resulta en una elipse mucho más grande que no refleja la verdadera distribución. El tamaño más grande de esta elipse es resultado de que los términos fuera de la diagonal de la matriz de covarianza se establecieron en cero, y corresponde a que el agente calculó erróneamente la incertidumbre en la probabilidad de que se cumpla cada dimensión del contrato. Esto, a su vez, hace que se calcule de forma incorrecta la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada de un contrato (mostrada en la figura 1 como Var(E[U]). 5. COMUNICANDO REPUTACIÓN Habiendo descrito cómo un agente individual puede utilizar su propia experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para estimar la probabilidad. Nota que las gráficas no son suaves debido al hecho de que, dado un número limitado de resultados de contratos, la media de Va y Vb no varía suavemente con ρ. 1074 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), ahora pasamos a considerar cómo los agentes dentro de un sistema multiagente abierto pueden comunicar estas estimaciones entre sí. Esto se conoce comúnmente como reputación y permite a los agentes con experiencia directa limitada de un proveedor tomar decisiones racionales. Tanto Jøsang e Ismail, como Teacy y colaboradores, presentan modelos en los que la reputación se comunica entre agentes utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta [6, 11]. Este enfoque es atractivo ya que estas estadísticas suficientes son simples agregaciones de los resultados de los contratos (más precisamente, simplemente son el número total de contratos observados, N, y el número de estos que se cumplieron exitosamente, n). Bajo el marco probabilístico de la distribución beta, los informes de reputación en esta forma simplemente pueden ser agregados con la propia experiencia directa de un agente, con el fin de obtener una estimación más precisa basada en un conjunto más amplio de resultados de contratos. Podemos extender inmediatamente este enfoque al caso multidimensional considerado aquí, al requerir que los agentes intercambien las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet en lugar de la distribución beta. En este caso, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), los agentes deben comunicar un vector de resultados de contrato, N, que son las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet, dadas por: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Por lo tanto, un agente puede comunicar las estadísticas suficientes de su propia distribución de Dirichlet en términos de solo 2d(d − 1) números (donde d es el número de dimensiones de contrato). Por ejemplo, en el caso de tres dimensiones, N, se da por: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > y, por lo tanto, conjuntos grandes de resultados de contratos pueden ser comunicados dentro de un tamaño de mensaje relativamente pequeño, sin pérdida de información. Una vez más, los agentes que reciben estas estadísticas suficientes pueden simplemente agregarlas a su propia experiencia directa para obtener una estimación más precisa de la confiabilidad de un proveedor. Finalmente, cabe destacar que si bien no es el enfoque de nuestro trabajo aquí, al adoptar el mismo enfoque basado en principios que Jøsang e Ismail, y Teacy y otros, muchas de las técnicas que han desarrollado (como descontar informes de agentes no confiables y filtrar informes inconsistentes de agentes egoístas) pueden aplicarse directamente dentro de este modelo multidimensional. Sin embargo, ahora pasamos a considerar un nuevo problema que surge tanto en los modelos unidimensionales como multidimensionales, a saber, los problemas que surgen cuando dichas estadísticas suficientes agregadas se propagan dentro de redes de agentes descentralizados. 6. PROPAGACIÓN DE RUMORES DENTRO DE SISTEMAS DE REPUTACIÓN En la sección anterior, describimos el uso de estadísticas suficientes para comunicar la reputación, y demostramos que al agregar los resultados de los contratos en estas estadísticas suficientes, se puede representar y comunicar un gran número de resultados de contratos de forma compacta. Si bien esta es una propiedad atractiva, puede ser problemática en la práctica, ya que la procedencia individual de cada resultado de contrato se pierde en la agregación. Por lo tanto, para garantizar una estimación precisa, el sistema de reputación debe asegurarse de que cada observación de un resultado de contrato se incluya en las estadísticas agregadas no más de una vez. Dentro de un sistema de reputación centralizado, donde todos los agentes informan sus experiencias directas a un centro de confianza, es fácil evitar el <br>doble conteo</br> de resultados de contratos. Sin embargo, en un sistema de reputación descentralizado, donde los agentes comunican la reputación entre sí y agregan su experiencia directa con estos informes de reputación sobre la marcha, evitar el <br>doble conteo</br> es mucho más difícil. Por ejemplo, considera el caso mostrado en la figura 3 donde tres agentes (a1 . . . a3), cada uno con cierta experiencia directa de un proveedor, comparten informes de reputación sobre este proveedor. Si el agente a1 proporcionara su estimación a los agentes a2 y a3 en forma de las estadísticas suficientes de su distribución de Dirichlet, entonces estos agentes pueden agregar estos resultados contractuales con los suyos propios, y así obtener estimaciones más precisas. Si en una etapa posterior, el agente a2 enviara su vector agregado de resultados de contratos al agente a3, entonces el agente a3, al no estar al tanto de toda la historia de intercambios, podría intentar combinar estos resultados de contratos con su propio vector agregado. Sin embargo, dado que ambos vectores contienen una contribución del agente a1, estos serán contados dos veces en el vector agregado final, lo que resultará en una estimación sesgada y excesivamente confiada. Esto se denomina propagación de rumores o incesto de datos en la literatura de fusión de datos [9]. Una posible solución sería identificar de manera única la fuente de cada resultado de contrato, y luego propagar cada vector, junto con su etiqueta, a través de la red. Los agentes pueden identificar así observaciones idénticas que han llegado por diferentes rutas, y después de eliminar los duplicados, pueden agregarlos juntos para formar sus estimaciones. Si bien esto parece atractivo en principio, por varias razones, no siempre es una solución viable en la práctica [12]. En primer lugar, los agentes pueden no desear que sus resultados de contrato etiquetados de manera única se compartan en un sistema abierto, ya que dicha información puede tener importancia comercial o práctica que podría ser utilizada en su contra. Por lo tanto, es posible que los agentes solo estén dispuestos a intercambiar resultados de contratos identificables con un pequeño número de otros agentes (quizás aquellos con los que tengan algún tipo de relación recíproca). En segundo lugar, el hecho de que no haya una agregación de los resultados del contrato a medida que circulan por la red significa que el tamaño del mensaje aumenta con el tiempo, y el tamaño final de estos mensajes está limitado únicamente por el número de agentes dentro del sistema (posiblemente un número extremadamente grande para un sistema global). Finalmente, puede resultar realmente difícil asignar etiquetas globalmente aceptables, consistentes y únicas para cada agente dentro de un sistema abierto. En la siguiente sección, desarrollamos una solución novedosa al problema de la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Nuestra solución se basa en un enfoque desarrollado dentro del área de seguimiento de objetivos y fusión de datos [9]. Evita la necesidad de identificar de forma única a un agente, permite a los agentes restringir la cantidad de otros agentes a los que revelan sus estimaciones privadas, y aún así permite que la información se propague por toda la red. 6.1 Información Privada y Compartida Nuestra solución para la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados introduce la noción de información privada que un agente sabe que no ha comunicado a ningún otro agente, y de información compartida que ha sido comunicada a, o recibida de, otro agente. Por lo tanto, el agente puede descomponer su vector de resultado de contrato, N, en dos vectores, uno privado, Np, que no ha sido comunicado a otro agente, y uno compartido, Ns, que ha sido compartido con, o recibido de, otro agente: N = Np + Ns (19). Ahora, cada vez que un agente comunica la reputación, comunica ambos vectores privados y compartidos por separado. Ambos el origEl Sexto Intl. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), los agentes emisores y receptores actualizan sus dos vectores de manera apropiada. Para entender esto, considera el caso en el que el agente aα envía sus vectores de resultados de contrato privados y compartidos, Nα p y Nα s, al agente aβ que a su vez tiene resultados de contrato privados y compartidos Nβ p y Nβ s. Cada agente actualiza sus vectores de resultados de contrato de acuerdo con el siguiente procedimiento: • Agente de origen: Una vez que el agente de origen ha enviado tanto sus vectores de resultados de contrato compartidos como privados a otro agente, su información privada ya no es privada. Por lo tanto, debe eliminar los resultados de contrato que estaban en su vector privado y agregarlos a su vector compartido: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Agente Receptor: El objetivo del agente receptor es acumular el mayor número de resultados de contrato (ya que esto resultará en la estimación más precisa) sin incluir información compartida tanto de sí mismo como del otro agente (ya que esto podría resultar en la <br>duplicación de resultados de contrato</br>). Tiene dos opciones dependiendo del número total de resultados de contrato dentro de su propio vector compartido, Nβ s , y dentro del del agente de origen, Nα s. Así, actualiza su vector de acuerdo con el procedimiento siguiente: - Nβ s > Nα s: Si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un mayor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente combina su vector compartido con el vector privado del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. - Nβ s < Nα s: Alternativamente, si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un menor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente receptor descarta su propio vector compartido y forma uno nuevo a partir de los vectores privado y compartido del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. En caso de que Nβ s = Nα s, entonces cualquiera de las opciones es apropiada. Una vez que el agente receptor ha actualizado sus conjuntos, utiliza los resultados del contrato en ambos para formar su estimación de confianza. Si los agentes reciben varios vectores simultáneamente, este enfoque se generaliza al agente receptor utilizando el vector compartido más grande, y los vectores privados de sí mismo y de todos los agentes originales para formar su nuevo vector compartido. Este procedimiento tiene varias propiedades atractivas. En primer lugar, dado que los resultados de los contratos en un vector compartido de agentes nunca se combinan con los de otro agente en el vector compartido, los resultados que provienen del mismo agente nunca se combinan entre sí, y por lo tanto, la propagación de rumores se evita por completo. Sin embargo, dado que el agente receptor puede descartar su propio vector compartido y adoptar el vector compartido del agente de origen, la información sigue propagándose por la red. Además, dado que los resultados de los contratos se agregan juntos dentro de los vectores privados y compartidos, el tamaño del mensaje es constante y no aumenta a medida que aumenta el número de interacciones. Finalmente, un agente solo comunica los resultados de su propio contrato privado a sus vecinos inmediatos. Si este agente 6 lo transmite posteriormente, lo hace como información agregada no identificable dentro de su información compartida. Por lo tanto, un agente puede limitar el número de agentes con los que está dispuesto a revelar resultados de contratos identificables, y sin embargo, estos resultados de contratos aún pueden propagarse dentro de la red, y así mejorar las estimaciones de otros agentes. A continuación, demostramos empíricamente que estas propiedades pueden ser realizadas en la práctica. 6.2 Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de este procedimiento, simulamos redes aleatorias compuestas por diez agentes. Cada agente tiene cierta experiencia directa de interactuar con un proveedor (como se describe en la sección 4.3). En cada iteración de la simulación, interactúa con sus vecinos inmediatos y intercambia informes de reputación a través de las estadísticas suficientes de sus distribuciones de Dirichlet. Comparamos nuestra solución con dos de las alternativas descentralizadas más obvias: • Información Privada y Compartida: Los agentes siguen el procedimiento descrito en la sección anterior. Es decir, mantienen vectores separados privados y compartidos de resultados de contrato, y en cada iteración comunican ambos vectores a sus vecinos inmediatos. • Propagación de rumores: Los agentes no diferencian entre resultados de contrato privados y compartidos. En la primera iteración comunican todos los resultados del contrato que constituyen su experiencia directa. En iteraciones posteriores, propagan los resultados de los contratos que reciben de cualquiera de los vecinos a todos sus otros vecinos inmediatos. • Solo Información Privada: Los agentes solo comunican los resultados de los contratos que constituyen su experiencia directa. En todos los casos, en cada iteración, los agentes utilizan la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular sus estimaciones de confianza. Comparamos estos tres enfoques descentralizados con un sistema de reputación centralizado: • Reputación Centralizada: Todos los agentes transmiten su experiencia directa a un sistema de reputación centralizado que las agrega y devuelve esta estimación a cada agente. Esta solución centralizada hace el uso más efectivo de la información disponible en la red. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los problemas del mundo real requieren soluciones descentralizadas debido a preocupaciones de escalabilidad, modularidad y comunicación. Por lo tanto, esta solución centralizada se incluye ya que representa el caso óptimo, y nos permite comparar nuestra solución descentralizada. Los resultados de estas comparaciones se muestran en la figura 4. Aquí mostramos la suma del contenido de información de la matriz de covarianza de cada agente (calculada como se discutió anteriormente en la sección 4.3), para cada uno de estos cuatro enfoques diferentes. Primero observamos que cuando solo se comunica información privada, no hay cambio en la información después de la primera iteración. Una vez que cada agente ha recibido la experiencia directa de sus vecinos inmediatos, no se puede lograr un aumento adicional en la información. Esto representa la comunicación mínima y exhibe la menor cantidad total de información de los cuatro casos. A continuación, observamos que en el caso de la propagación de rumores, el contenido de la información aumenta continuamente y supera rápidamente el resultado de la reputación centralizada. El hecho de que el caso de propagación de rumores exceda incorrectamente este límite indica que está contando continuamente los mismos resultados de contrato a medida que circulan por la red, creyendo que son eventos independientes. Finalmente, observamos que el uso de información privada y compartida representa un compromiso entre el caso de solo información privada y el caso de reputación centralizada. La información todavía se permite propagar por la red, sin embargo los rumores son eliminados. Como antes, también representamos una única instancia de las estimaciones de confianza de un agente (es decir, ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X))) como un conjunto de elipses en un 1076 The Sixth Intl.

Como era de esperar, el sistema de reputación centralizado logra la mejor estimación de la distribución real, ya que utiliza la experiencia directa de todos los agentes. El caso de información privada muestra la elipse más grande ya que propaga la menor cantidad de información alrededor de la red. El caso de propagación de rumores muestra la elipse más pequeña, pero es inconsistente con la distribución real p(X). Por lo tanto, propagar rumores en la red y <br>contar dos veces</br> los resultados de los contratos creyendo que son eventos independientes, resulta en una estimación excesivamente confiada. ",

                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
                "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
                "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",
                "To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",
                "The starting point for our work is to consider how an agent can estimate the utility that it will derive from interacting with a supplier.",
                "Here we use standard approaches from the literature of data fusion (since this is a well developed field where the notion of multi-dimensional correlated estimates is well established1 ) to show that this naturally leads to a trust model where the agent must estimate probabilities and correlations over 1 In this context, the multiple dimensions typically represent the physical coordinates of a target being tracked, and correlations arise through the operation and orientation of sensors. 1070 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS multiple dimensions.",
                "Building upon this, we then devise a novel trust model that addresses the three desiderata discussed above.",
                "In more detail, in this paper we extend the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
                "We devise a novel multi-dimensional probabilistic trust model that enables an agent to estimate the expected utility of a contract, by estimating (i) the probability that each contract dimension will be successfully fulfilled, and (ii) the correlations between these estimates. 2.",
                "We present an exact probabilistic model based upon the Dirichlet distribution that allows agents to use their direct experience of contract outcomes to calculate the probabilities and correlations described above.",
                "We then benchmark this solution and show that it leads to good estimates. 3.",
                "We show that agents can use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution in order to exchange reputation reports with one another.",
                "The sufficient statistics represent aggregations of their direct experience, and thus, express contract outcomes in a compact format with no loss of information. 4.",
                "We show that, while being efficient, the aggregation of contract outcomes can lead to double counting, and <br>rumour propagation</br>, in decentralised reputation systems.",
                "Thus, we present a novel solution based upon the idea of private and shared information.",
                "We show that it yields estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding overconfidence.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: in section 2 we review related work.",
                "In section 3 we present our notation for a single dimensional contract, before introducing our multi-dimensional trust model in section 4.",
                "In sections 5 and 6 we discuss communicating reputation, and present our solution to <br>rumour propagation</br> in decentralised reputation systems.",
                "We conclude in section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK The need for a multi-dimensional trust model has been recognised by a number of researchers.",
                "Sabater and Sierra present a model of reputation, in which agents form contracts based on multiple variables (such as delivery date and quality), and define impressions as subjective evaluations of the outcome of these contracts.",
                "They provide heuristic approaches to combining these impressions to form a measure they call subjective reputation.",
                "Likewise, Griffiths decomposes overall trust into a number of different dimensions such as success, cost, timeliness and quality [4].",
                "In his case, each dimension is scored as a real number that represents a comparative value with no strong semantic meaning.",
                "He develops an heuristic rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers.",
                "Whilst, he comments that the trust values could have some associated confidence level, heuristics for updating these levels are not presented.",
                "Gujral et al. take a similar approach and present a trust model over multiple domain specific dimensions [5].",
                "They define multidimensional goal requirements, and evaluate an expected payoff based on a suppliers estimated behaviour.",
                "These estimates are, however, simple aggregations over the direct experience of several agents, and there is no measure of the uncertainty.",
                "Nevertheless, they show that agents who select suppliers based on these multiple dimensions outperform those who consider just a single one.",
                "By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension.",
                "Jøsang and Ismail describe the Beta Reputation System whereby the reputation of an agent is compiled from the positive and negative reports from other agents who have interacted with it [6].",
                "The beta distribution represents a natural choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a principled means of representing uncertainty.",
                "Moreover, they provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques to deal with reputations that may change over time.",
                "Likewise, Teacy et al. use the beta distribution to describe an agents belief in the probability that another agent will successfully fulfill its commitments [11].",
                "They present a formalism using a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other agents.",
                "They provide a number of extensions to this initial model, and, in particular, they consider that agents may not always truthfully report their trust estimates.",
                "Thus, they present a principled approach to detecting and removing inconsistent reports.",
                "Our work builds upon these more principled approaches.",
                "However, the starting point of our approach is to consider an agent that is attempting to estimate the expected utility of a contract.",
                "We show that estimating this expected utility requires that an agent must estimate the probability with which the supplier will fulfill its contract.",
                "In the single-dimensional case, this naturally leads to a trust model using the beta distribution (as per Jøsang and Ismail and Teacy et al.).",
                "However, we then go on to extend this analysis to multiple dimensions, where we use the natural extension of the beta distribution, namely the Dirichlet distribution, to represent the agents belief over multiple dimensions. 3.",
                "SINGLE-DIMENSIONAL TRUST Before presenting our multi-dimensional trust model, we first introduce the notation and formalism that we will use by describing the more familiar single dimensional case.",
                "We consider an agent who must decide whether to engage in a future contract with a supplier.",
                "This contract will lead to some outcome, o, and we consider that o = 1 if the contract is successfully fulfilled, and o = 0 if not2 .",
                "In order for the agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract.",
                "We assume that in the case that the contract is successfully fulfilled, the agent derives a utility u(o = 1), otherwise it receives no utility3 .",
                "Now, given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the supplier will fulfill the contract, it should consider the expected utility that it will derive, E[U], and this is given by: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) where p(o = 1) is the probability that the supplier will successfully fulfill the contract.",
                "However, whilst u(o = 1) is known by the agent, p(o = 1) is not.",
                "The best the agent can do is to determine a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct experience of previous contract outcomes.",
                "Given that it has been able to do so, it can then determine an estimate of the expected utility4 of the contract, E[E[U]], and a measure of its uncertainty in this expected utility, Var(E[U]).",
                "This uncertainty is important since a risk averse agent may make a decision regarding a contract, 2 Note that we only consider binary contract outcomes, although extending this to partial outcomes is part of our future work. 3 Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is derived from an unsuccessful outcome. 4 Note that this is often called the expected expected utility, and this is the notation that we adopt here [2].",

                "The utility based approach that we present here provides an attractive motivation for this model of Teacy et al. [11].",
                "Now, in the case of binary contract outcomes, the beta distribution is the natural choice to represent the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) since within Bayesian statistics this well known to be the conjugate prior for binomial observations [3].",
                "By adopting the beta distribution, we can calculate ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) using standard results, and thus, if an agent observed N previous contracts of which n were successfully fulfilled, then: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 and: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Note that as expected, the greater the number of contracts the agent observes, the smaller the variance term Var(p(o = 1)), and, thus, the less the uncertainty regarding the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1). 4.",
                "MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TRUST We now extend the description above, to consider contracts between suppliers and agents that are represented by multiple dimensions, and hence the success or failure of a contract can be decomposed into the success or failure of each separate dimension.",
                "Consider again the example of the supply chain that specifies the timeliness, quantity, and quality of the goods that are to be delivered.",
                "Thus, within our trust model oa = 1 now indicates a successful outcome over dimension a of the contract and oa = 0 indicates an unsuccessful one.",
                "A contract outcome, X, is now composed of a vector of individual contract part outcomes (e.g.",

                "Given a multi-dimensional contract whose outcome is described by the vector X, we again consider that in order for an agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract.",
                "To this end, we can make the general statement that the expected utility of a contract is given by: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) where p(X) is a joint probability distribution over all possible contract outcomes: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) and U(X) is the utility derived from these possible outcomes: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) As before, whilst U(X) is known to the agent, the probability distribution p(X) is not.",
                "Rather, given the agents direct experience of the supplier, the agent can determine a distribution over possible values for p(X).",
                "In the single dimensional case, a beta distribution was the natural choice over possible values of p(o = 1).",
                "In the multi-dimensional case, where p(X) itself is a vector of probabilities, the corresponding natural choice is the Dirichlet distribution, since this is a conjugate prior for multinomial proportions [3].",
                "Given this distribution, the agent is then able to calculate an estimate of the expected utility of a contract.",
                "As before, this estimate is itself represented by an expected value given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) and a variance, describing the uncertainty in this expected utility: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) where: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Thus, whilst the single dimensional case naturally leads to a trust model in which the agents attempt to derive an estimate of probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1), along with a scalar variance that describes the uncertainty in this probability, Var(p(o = 1)), in this case, the agents must derive an estimate of a vector of probabilities, ˆp(X), along with a covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), that represents the uncertainty in p(X) given the observed contractual outcomes.",
                "At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract.",

                "In the remainder of this paper, for illustrative purposes, we shall limit the discussion to the simplest possible utility function that exhibits a dependence upon the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
                "That is, we consider the case that expected utility is dependent only on the marginal probabilities of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, rather than the full joint probabilities: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Thus, ˆp(X) is a vector estimate of the probability of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, and maintains the clear semantic interpretation seen in the single dimensional case: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) The correlations between the contract dimensions affect the uncertainty in the expected utility.",

                "We first illustrate why this is necessary by considering an alternative approach to modelling multi-dimensional contracts whereby an agent na¨ıvely assumes that the dimensions are independent, and thus, it models each individually by separate beta distributions (as in the single dimensional case we presented in section 3).",
                "This is actually equivalent to setting the off-diagonal terms within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), to zero.",
                "However, doing so can lead an agent to assume that its estimate of the expected utility of the contract is more accurate than it actually is.",

                "Thus, in order to have an accurate estimate of the variance of the expected contract utility, and to make a rational decision, it is essential that the agent is able to represent and calculate these correlation terms.",
                "In the next section, we describe how an agent may do so using the Dirichlet distribution. 4.2 The Dirichlet Distribution In this section, we describe how the agent may use its direct experience of previous contracts, and the standard results of the Dirichlet distribution, to determine an estimate of the probability that each contract dimension will be successful fulfilled, ˆp(X), and a measure of the uncertainties in these probabilities that expresses the correlations between the contract dimensions, Cov(p(X)).",
                "We first consider the calculation of ˆp(X) and the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)).",
                "As described above, the derivation of these results is identical to the case of the single dimensional beta distribution, where out of N contract outcomes, n are successfully fulfilled.",
                "In the multi-dimensional case, however, we have a vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} that represents the number of outcomes for which each of the individual contract dimensions were successfully fulfilled.",
                "Thus, in terms of the standard Dirichlet parameters where αa = na + 1 and α0 = N + 2, the agent can estimate the probability of this contract dimension being successfully fulfilled: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 and can also calculate the variance in any contract dimension: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) However, calculating the off-diagonal terms within Cov(p(X)) is more complex since it is necessary to consider the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
                "Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j.",

                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",
                "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",

                "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
                "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",

                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",

                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, <br>rumour propagation</br> is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",

INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la <br>propagación de rumores</br> en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la <br>propagación de rumores</br> en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Él desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5]. Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión. Jøsang e Ismail describen el Sistema de Reputación Beta, en el cual la reputación de un agente se compila a partir de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6]. La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio fundamentado para representar la incertidumbre. Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluyen un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descontar las opiniones de agentes que tienen calificaciones de reputación bajas, y técnicas para manejar reputaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo. Asimismo, Teacy et al. utilizan la distribución beta para describir la creencia de un agente en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla exitosamente con sus compromisos [11]. Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad basándose en su experiencia directa, y nuevamente utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes. Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial, y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan con veracidad sus estimaciones de confianza. Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque basado en principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes. Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más fundamentados. Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato. En el caso unidimensional, esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.). Sin embargo, luego pasamos a extender este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, es decir, la distribución de Dirichlet, para representar la creencia de los agentes sobre múltiples dimensiones. 3. CONFIANZA UNIDIMENSIONAL Antes de presentar nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional, primero introducimos la notación y el formalismo que utilizaremos describiendo el caso más familiar unidimensional. Consideramos a un agente que debe decidir si comprometerse en un contrato futuro con un proveedor. Este contrato llevará a algún resultado, o, y consideramos que o = 1 si el contrato se cumple con éxito, y o = 0 si no. Para que el agente pueda tomar una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Suponemos que en caso de que el contrato se cumpla con éxito, el agente obtiene una utilidad u(o = 1), de lo contrario no recibe ninguna utilidad. Ahora, dado que el agente no está seguro de la fiabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá el contrato, debería considerar la utilidad esperada que obtendrá, E[U], y esto se da por: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) donde p(o = 1) es la probabilidad de que el proveedor cumpla exitosamente con el contrato. Sin embargo, aunque el agente conoce u(o = 1), no conoce p(o = 1). Lo mejor que el agente puede hacer es determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1) dados sus experiencias directas de resultados de contratos anteriores. Dado que ha sido capaz de hacerlo, puede entonces determinar una estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, E[E[U]], y una medida de su incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada, Var(E[U]). Esta incertidumbre es importante ya que un agente adverso al riesgo puede tomar una decisión con respecto a un contrato. Nota que solo consideramos resultados de contratos binarios, aunque extender esto a resultados parciales es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro. Claramente esto puede extenderse al caso en el que se derive cierta utilidad de un resultado no exitoso. Nota que esto a menudo se llama la utilidad esperada esperada, y esta es la notación que adoptamos aquí. El Sexto Internacional. La Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) no solo se basa en su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, sino también en la probabilidad de que la utilidad esperada supere cierta cantidad mínima. Estas dos propiedades se dan por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) donde ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) son la estimación y la incertidumbre de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, y se calculan a partir de la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) que el agente determina a partir de su experiencia directa. El enfoque basado en utilidad que presentamos aquí proporciona una motivación atractiva para este modelo de Teacy et al. [11]. Ahora, en el caso de resultados de contratos binarios, la distribución beta es la elección natural para representar la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) ya que dentro de la estadística bayesiana se sabe que es la distribución previa conjugada para observaciones binomiales [3]. Al adoptar la distribución beta, podemos calcular ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) utilizando resultados estándar, y así, si un agente observó N contratos anteriores de los cuales n se cumplieron con éxito, entonces: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 y: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Tenga en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuanto mayor sea el número de contratos que el agente observa, menor será el término de varianza Var(p(o = 1)), y, por lo tanto, menor será la incertidumbre con respecto a la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1). CONFIANZA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL Ahora extendemos la descripción anterior para considerar contratos entre proveedores y agentes que están representados por múltiples dimensiones, por lo que el éxito o fracaso de un contrato puede descomponerse en el éxito o fracaso de cada dimensión por separado. Considera nuevamente el ejemplo de la cadena de suministro que especifica la puntualidad, cantidad y calidad de los bienes que deben ser entregados. Por lo tanto, dentro de nuestro modelo de confianza, oa = 1 ahora indica un resultado exitoso sobre la dimensión a del contrato y oa = 0 indica uno no exitoso. Un resultado de contrato, X, está compuesto ahora por un vector de resultados de partes individuales del contrato (por ejemplo, X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . . }). Dado un contrato multidimensional cuyo resultado está descrito por el vector X, consideramos nuevamente que para que un agente tome una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Con este fin, podemos hacer la afirmación general de que la utilidad esperada de un contrato se da por: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) donde p(X) es una distribución conjunta de probabilidad sobre todos los posibles resultados del contrato: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) y U(X) es la utilidad derivada de estos posibles resultados: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) Como antes, mientras que U(X) es conocido por el agente, la distribución de probabilidad p(X) no lo es. Más bien, dada la experiencia directa de los agentes con el proveedor, el agente puede determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(X). En el caso unidimensional, una distribución beta fue la elección natural sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1). En el caso multi-dimensional, donde p(X) en sí mismo es un vector de probabilidades, la elección natural correspondiente es la distribución de Dirichlet, ya que esta es una distribución previa conjugada para proporciones multinomiales [3]. Dada esta distribución, el agente puede calcular una estimación de la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Como antes, esta estimación está representada por un valor esperado dado por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) y una varianza, que describe la incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) donde: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Así, mientras que el caso unidimensional naturalmente conduce a un modelo de confianza en el que los agentes intentan derivar una estimación de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1), junto con una varianza escalar que describe la incertidumbre en esta probabilidad, Var(p(o = 1)), en este caso, los agentes deben derivar una estimación de un vector de probabilidades, ˆp(X), junto con una matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), que representa la incertidumbre en p(X) dadas las consecuencias contractuales observadas. En este punto, es interesante notar que la estimación en el caso unidimensional, ˆp(o = 1), tiene un claro significado semántico en relación con la confianza; es la creencia de los agentes en la probabilidad de que un proveedor cumpla exitosamente un contrato. Sin embargo, en el caso multidimensional, el agente debe determinar ˆp(X), y dado que esto describe la probabilidad de todos los posibles resultados del contrato, incluidos aquellos que no se cumplen en absoluto, esta interpretación semántica directa no está presente. En la siguiente sección, describimos la función de utilidad ejemplar que utilizaremos en el resto de este documento. 4.1 Función de Utilidad Ejemplar El enfoque descrito hasta ahora es completamente general, ya que se aplica a cualquier función de utilidad del tipo descrito anteriormente, y también se aplica a la estimación de cualquier distribución de probabilidad conjunta. En el resto de este documento, con fines ilustrativos, limitaremos la discusión a la función de utilidad más simple posible que muestre una dependencia de las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Es decir, consideramos el caso en el que la utilidad esperada depende solo de las probabilidades marginales de que se cumpla exitosamente cada dimensión del contrato, en lugar de las probabilidades conjuntas completas: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Por lo tanto, ˆp(X) es una estimación vectorial de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se cumpla exitosamente, y mantiene la clara interpretación semántica vista en el caso unidimensional: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) Las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato afectan la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada. Para ver esto, considera la covarianza 1072 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. La matriz que describe esta incertidumbre, Cov(p(X)), en la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se da ahora por: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . . I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab Vb Cbc . . .\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for translation? En esta matriz, los términos diagonales, Va, Vb y Vc, representan las incertidumbres en p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) y p(oc = 1) dentro de p(X). Los términos fuera de la diagonal, Cab, Cac y Cbc, representan las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades. En la siguiente sección, utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular tanto ˆp(X) como Cov(p(X)) a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente en los resultados de contratos anteriores. Primero ilustramos por qué esto es necesario considerando un enfoque alternativo para modelar contratos multidimensionales, en el cual un agente asume ingenuamente que las dimensiones son independientes, y por lo tanto, modela cada una individualmente mediante distribuciones beta separadas (como en el caso unidimensional que presentamos en la sección 3). Esto es en realidad equivalente a establecer los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), a cero. Sin embargo, hacerlo puede llevar a un agente a asumir que su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato es más precisa de lo que en realidad es. Para ilustrar esto, considera un escenario específico con los siguientes valores: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 y Va = Vb = 0.2. En este caso, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), y por lo tanto, si se ignora la correlación Cab, la varianza en la utilidad esperada es de 0.4. Sin embargo, si los resultados del contrato están completamente correlacionados, entonces Cab = 1 y Var(E[U]) es en realidad 0.8. Por lo tanto, para tener una estimación precisa de la varianza de la utilidad del contrato esperada, y para tomar una decisión racional, es esencial que el agente sea capaz de representar y calcular estos términos de correlación. En la siguiente sección, describimos cómo un agente puede hacerlo utilizando la distribución de Dirichlet. 4.2 La Distribución de Dirichlet En esta sección, describimos cómo el agente puede utilizar su experiencia directa de contratos anteriores y los resultados estándar de la distribución de Dirichlet para determinar una estimación de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato sea cumplida exitosamente, ˆp(X), y una medida de las incertidumbres en estas probabilidades que expresa las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato, Cov(p(X)). Primero consideramos el cálculo de ˆp(X) y los términos diagonales de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)). Como se describe arriba, la derivación de estos resultados es idéntica al caso de la distribución beta unidimensional, donde de N resultados de contratos, n se cumplen exitosamente. En el caso multi-dimensional, sin embargo, tenemos un vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} que representa el número de resultados para los cuales se cumplieron con éxito cada una de las dimensiones individuales del contrato. Por lo tanto, en términos de los parámetros estándar de Dirichlet donde αa = na + 1 y α0 = N + 2, el agente puede estimar la probabilidad de que esta dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 y también puede calcular la varianza en cualquier dimensión del contrato: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Sin embargo, calcular los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de Cov(p(X)) es más complejo ya que es necesario considerar las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Por lo tanto, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), debemos considerar todas las posibles combinaciones de resultados de contrato, y así definimos nab ij como el número de resultados de contrato para los cuales tanto oa = i como ob = j. Por ejemplo, nab 10 representa el número de contratos para los cuales oa = 1 y ob = 0. Ahora, utilizando la notación estándar de Dirichlet, podemos definir αab ij nab ij + 1 para todos los i y j que toman valores 0 y 1, y luego, para calcular las correlaciones cruzadas entre los pares de contratos a y b, observamos que la distribución de Dirichlet sobre las probabilidades conjuntas par a par es: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 donde: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 y Kab es una constante de normalización [3]. A partir de esto podemos derivar estimaciones de probabilidad y varianzas por pares: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) donde: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) y de hecho, α0 = N + 2, donde N es el número total de contratos observados. Asimismo, podemos expresar la covarianza en estas probabilidades por pares en términos similares: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0). Finalmente, podemos utilizar la expresión: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) para determinar la covarianza Cab. Para hacerlo, primero simplificamos la notación definiendo V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] y Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)]. La covarianza para la probabilidad de resultados positivos de contrato es entonces la covarianza entre j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) e i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), y por lo tanto: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11. Por lo tanto, dado un conjunto de resultados de contratos que representan las interacciones previas de los agentes con un proveedor, podemos utilizar la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular la media y la varianza de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato (es decir, ˆp(oa = 1) y Va). Además, mediante un procedimiento algo más complejo también podemos calcular las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades (es decir, ... I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab).\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for me to translate to Spanish? Esto nos permite calcular una estimación de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato, ˆp(X), y también representar la incertidumbre y correlaciones en estas probabilidades mediante la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)). A su vez, estos resultados pueden ser utilizados para calcular la estimación y la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada del contrato. En la siguiente sección presentamos resultados empíricos que muestran que en la práctica este formalismo produce mejoras significativas en estas estimaciones en comparación con la aproximación ingenua que utiliza múltiples distribuciones beta independientes. Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de nuestro formalismo y mostrar la importancia de los términos fuera de la diagonal en Cov(p(X)), comparamos dos enfoques: La Sexta Conferencia Internacional.

Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones, y las barras de error muestran el error estándar en la media. • Distribución de Dirichlet: Utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet completa, como se describe arriba, para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), incluyendo todos sus términos fuera de la diagonal que representan las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. • Distribuciones Beta Independientes: Utilizamos distribuciones beta independientes para representar cada dimensión del contrato, con el fin de calcular ˆp(X), y luego, como se describió anteriormente, aproximamos Cov(p(X)) e ignoramos las correlaciones al establecer todos los términos fuera de la diagonal en cero. Consideramos un caso bidimensional donde u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2, ya que esto nos permite trazar ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) como elipses en un plano bidimensional, y así explicar las diferencias entre los dos enfoques. Específicamente, inicialmente asignamos al agente algunos resultados de contratos anteriores que representan su experiencia directa con un proveedor. El número de contratos se elige de forma uniforme entre 10 y 20, y los resultados reales de los contratos se eligen de una distribución conjunta arbitraria destinada a inducir correlaciones entre las dimensiones de los contratos. Para cada conjunto de contratos, utilizamos los enfoques descritos anteriormente para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), y por lo tanto, la varianza en la utilidad esperada del contrato, Var(E[U]). Además, calculamos una medida escalar del contenido de información, I, de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)), que es una forma estándar de medir la incertidumbre codificada dentro de la matriz de covarianza [1]. Más específicamente, calculamos el determinante de la inversa de la matriz de covarianza: I = det(Cov(p(X))−1 ) (16) y observamos que cuanto mayor sea el contenido de información, más precisa será ˆp(X), y por lo tanto, mejor será la estimación de la utilidad esperada que el agente puede calcular. Finalmente, utilizamos los resultados 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 p(o =1) p(o=1) a b Distribución de Dirichlet Distribuciones Beta Independientes Figura 2: Ejemplos de ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) representados como elipses de segundo error estándar. presentados en la sección 4.2 para calcular la correlación real, ρ, asociada con este conjunto particular de resultados de contrato: ρ = Cab √ VaVb (17) donde Cab, Va y Vb se calculan como se describe en la sección 4.2. Los resultados de este análisis se muestran en la figura 1. Aquí mostramos los valores de I y Var(E[U]) calculados por los agentes, representados en función de la correlación de los resultados del contrato, ρ, que constituyeron su experiencia directa. Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones de simulación. Se debe tener en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuando las dimensiones de los resultados del contrato no están correlacionadas (es decir, ρ = 0), ambos enfoques dan los mismos resultados. Sin embargo, el valor de utilizar nuestro formalismo con la distribución de Dirichlet completa se muestra cuando la correlación entre las dimensiones aumenta (ya sea de forma negativa o positiva). Como se puede observar, si aproximamos la distribución de Dirichlet con múltiples distribuciones beta independientes, toda la información de correlación contenida en la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), se pierde, y por lo tanto, el contenido informativo de la matriz es mucho menor. La pérdida de esta información de correlación hace que la varianza de la utilidad esperada del contrato sea incorrecta (ya sea sobreestimada o subestimada dependiendo de la correlación), con la cantidad exacta de subestimación dependiendo de la función de utilidad real elegida (es decir, los valores de u(oa = 1) y u(ob = 1)). Además, en la figura 2 ilustramos un ejemplo de las estimaciones calculadas a través de ambos métodos, para un único conjunto de resultados de contratos. Representamos las estimaciones de probabilidad, ˆp(X), y la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), de la manera estándar como una elipse [1]. Es decir, ˆp(X) determina la posición del centro de la elipse, Cov(p(X)) define su tamaño y forma. Cabe destacar que si bien la elipse resultante del formalismo completo de Dirichlet refleja con precisión la verdadera distribución (cuyas muestras se representan como puntos), la calculada al utilizar múltiples distribuciones Beta independientes (y por lo tanto ignorando las correlaciones) resulta en una elipse mucho más grande que no refleja la verdadera distribución. El tamaño más grande de esta elipse es resultado de que los términos fuera de la diagonal de la matriz de covarianza se establecieron en cero, y corresponde a que el agente calculó erróneamente la incertidumbre en la probabilidad de que se cumpla cada dimensión del contrato. Esto, a su vez, hace que se calcule de forma incorrecta la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada de un contrato (mostrada en la figura 1 como Var(E[U]). 5. COMUNICANDO REPUTACIÓN Habiendo descrito cómo un agente individual puede utilizar su propia experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para estimar la probabilidad. Nota que las gráficas no son suaves debido al hecho de que, dado un número limitado de resultados de contratos, la media de Va y Vb no varía suavemente con ρ. 1074 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), ahora pasamos a considerar cómo los agentes dentro de un sistema multiagente abierto pueden comunicar estas estimaciones entre sí. Esto se conoce comúnmente como reputación y permite a los agentes con experiencia directa limitada de un proveedor tomar decisiones racionales. Tanto Jøsang e Ismail, como Teacy y colaboradores, presentan modelos en los que la reputación se comunica entre agentes utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta [6, 11]. Este enfoque es atractivo ya que estas estadísticas suficientes son simples agregaciones de los resultados de los contratos (más precisamente, simplemente son el número total de contratos observados, N, y el número de estos que se cumplieron exitosamente, n). Bajo el marco probabilístico de la distribución beta, los informes de reputación en esta forma simplemente pueden ser agregados con la propia experiencia directa de un agente, con el fin de obtener una estimación más precisa basada en un conjunto más amplio de resultados de contratos. Podemos extender inmediatamente este enfoque al caso multidimensional considerado aquí, al requerir que los agentes intercambien las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet en lugar de la distribución beta. En este caso, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), los agentes deben comunicar un vector de resultados de contrato, N, que son las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet, dadas por: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Por lo tanto, un agente puede comunicar las estadísticas suficientes de su propia distribución de Dirichlet en términos de solo 2d(d − 1) números (donde d es el número de dimensiones de contrato). Por ejemplo, en el caso de tres dimensiones, N, se da por: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > y, por lo tanto, conjuntos grandes de resultados de contratos pueden ser comunicados dentro de un tamaño de mensaje relativamente pequeño, sin pérdida de información. Una vez más, los agentes que reciben estas estadísticas suficientes pueden simplemente agregarlas a su propia experiencia directa para obtener una estimación más precisa de la confiabilidad de un proveedor. Finalmente, cabe destacar que si bien no es el enfoque de nuestro trabajo aquí, al adoptar el mismo enfoque basado en principios que Jøsang e Ismail, y Teacy y otros, muchas de las técnicas que han desarrollado (como descontar informes de agentes no confiables y filtrar informes inconsistentes de agentes egoístas) pueden aplicarse directamente dentro de este modelo multidimensional. Sin embargo, ahora pasamos a considerar un nuevo problema que surge tanto en los modelos unidimensionales como multidimensionales, a saber, los problemas que surgen cuando dichas estadísticas suficientes agregadas se propagan dentro de redes de agentes descentralizados. 6. PROPAGACIÓN DE RUMORES DENTRO DE SISTEMAS DE REPUTACIÓN En la sección anterior, describimos el uso de estadísticas suficientes para comunicar la reputación, y demostramos que al agregar los resultados de los contratos en estas estadísticas suficientes, se puede representar y comunicar un gran número de resultados de contratos de forma compacta. Si bien esta es una propiedad atractiva, puede ser problemática en la práctica, ya que la procedencia individual de cada resultado de contrato se pierde en la agregación. Por lo tanto, para garantizar una estimación precisa, el sistema de reputación debe asegurarse de que cada observación de un resultado de contrato se incluya en las estadísticas agregadas no más de una vez. Dentro de un sistema de reputación centralizado, donde todos los agentes informan sus experiencias directas a un centro de confianza, es fácil evitar el doble conteo de resultados de contratos. Sin embargo, en un sistema de reputación descentralizado, donde los agentes comunican la reputación entre sí y agregan su experiencia directa con estos informes de reputación sobre la marcha, evitar el doble conteo es mucho más difícil.

                "In the next section, we describe how an agent may do so using the Dirichlet distribution. 4.2 The Dirichlet Distribution In this section, we describe how the agent may use its direct experience of previous contracts, and the standard results of the Dirichlet distribution, to determine an estimate of the probability that each contract dimension will be successful fulfilled, ˆp(X), and a measure of the uncertainties in these probabilities that expresses the correlations between the contract dimensions, Cov(p(X)).",
                "We first consider the calculation of ˆp(X) and the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)).",
                "As described above, the derivation of these results is identical to the case of the single dimensional beta distribution, where out of N contract outcomes, n are successfully fulfilled.",
                "In the multi-dimensional case, however, we have a vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} that represents the number of outcomes for which each of the individual contract dimensions were successfully fulfilled.",
                "Thus, in terms of the standard Dirichlet parameters where αa = na + 1 and α0 = N + 2, the agent can estimate the probability of this contract dimension being successfully fulfilled: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 and can also calculate the variance in any contract dimension: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) However, calculating the off-diagonal terms within Cov(p(X)) is more complex since it is necessary to consider the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
                "Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j.",
                "For example, nab 10 represents the number of contracts for which oa = 1 and ob = 0.",
                "Now, using the standard Dirichlet notation, we can define αab ij nab ij + 1 for all i and j taking values 0 and 1, and then, to calculate the cross-correlations between contract pairs a and b, we note that the Dirichlet distribution over pair-wise joint probabilities is: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 where: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 and Kab is a normalising constant [3].",
                "From this we can derive pair-wise probability estimates and variances: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) where: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) and in fact, α0 = N + 2, where N is the total number of contracts observed.",
                "Likewise, we can express the covariance in these pairwise probabilities in similar terms: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0) Finally, we can use the expression: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) to determine the covariance Cab.",
                "To do so, we first simplify the notation by defining V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] and Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)].",
                "The covariance for the probability of positive contract outcomes is then the covariance between j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) and i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), and thus: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11 .",
                "Thus, given a set of contract outcomes that represent the agents previous interactions with a supplier, we may use the Dirichlet distribution to calculate the mean and variance of the probability of any contract dimension being successfully fulfilled (i.e. ˆp(oa = 1) and Va).",

                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",
                "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",

INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un <br>sistema de reputación</br> centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Él desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5]. Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión.

                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",

                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",

                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",

                "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",

                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",

                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
                "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
                "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",

                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
                "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",

                "We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration.",
                "Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved.",
                "This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases.",

                "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",

INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el <br>anonimato</br> de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Él desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5]. Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión. Jøsang e Ismail describen el Sistema de Reputación Beta, en el cual la reputación de un agente se compila a partir de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6]. La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio fundamentado para representar la incertidumbre. Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluyen un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descontar las opiniones de agentes que tienen calificaciones de reputación bajas, y técnicas para manejar reputaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo. Asimismo, Teacy et al. utilizan la distribución beta para describir la creencia de un agente en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla exitosamente con sus compromisos [11]. Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad basándose en su experiencia directa, y nuevamente utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes. Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial, y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan con veracidad sus estimaciones de confianza. Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque basado en principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes. Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más fundamentados. Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato. En el caso unidimensional, esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.). Sin embargo, luego pasamos a extender este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, es decir, la distribución de Dirichlet, para representar la creencia de los agentes sobre múltiples dimensiones. 3. CONFIANZA UNIDIMENSIONAL Antes de presentar nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional, primero introducimos la notación y el formalismo que utilizaremos describiendo el caso más familiar unidimensional. Consideramos a un agente que debe decidir si comprometerse en un contrato futuro con un proveedor. Este contrato llevará a algún resultado, o, y consideramos que o = 1 si el contrato se cumple con éxito, y o = 0 si no. Para que el agente pueda tomar una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Suponemos que en caso de que el contrato se cumpla con éxito, el agente obtiene una utilidad u(o = 1), de lo contrario no recibe ninguna utilidad. Ahora, dado que el agente no está seguro de la fiabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá el contrato, debería considerar la utilidad esperada que obtendrá, E[U], y esto se da por: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) donde p(o = 1) es la probabilidad de que el proveedor cumpla exitosamente con el contrato. Sin embargo, aunque el agente conoce u(o = 1), no conoce p(o = 1). Lo mejor que el agente puede hacer es determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1) dados sus experiencias directas de resultados de contratos anteriores. Dado que ha sido capaz de hacerlo, puede entonces determinar una estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, E[E[U]], y una medida de su incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada, Var(E[U]). Esta incertidumbre es importante ya que un agente adverso al riesgo puede tomar una decisión con respecto a un contrato. Nota que solo consideramos resultados de contratos binarios, aunque extender esto a resultados parciales es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro. Claramente esto puede extenderse al caso en el que se derive cierta utilidad de un resultado no exitoso. Nota que esto a menudo se llama la utilidad esperada esperada, y esta es la notación que adoptamos aquí. El Sexto Internacional. La Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) no solo se basa en su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, sino también en la probabilidad de que la utilidad esperada supere cierta cantidad mínima. Estas dos propiedades se dan por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) donde ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) son la estimación y la incertidumbre de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, y se calculan a partir de la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) que el agente determina a partir de su experiencia directa. El enfoque basado en utilidad que presentamos aquí proporciona una motivación atractiva para este modelo de Teacy et al. [11]. Ahora, en el caso de resultados de contratos binarios, la distribución beta es la elección natural para representar la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) ya que dentro de la estadística bayesiana se sabe que es la distribución previa conjugada para observaciones binomiales [3]. Al adoptar la distribución beta, podemos calcular ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) utilizando resultados estándar, y así, si un agente observó N contratos anteriores de los cuales n se cumplieron con éxito, entonces: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 y: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Tenga en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuanto mayor sea el número de contratos que el agente observa, menor será el término de varianza Var(p(o = 1)), y, por lo tanto, menor será la incertidumbre con respecto a la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1). CONFIANZA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL Ahora extendemos la descripción anterior para considerar contratos entre proveedores y agentes que están representados por múltiples dimensiones, por lo que el éxito o fracaso de un contrato puede descomponerse en el éxito o fracaso de cada dimensión por separado. Considera nuevamente el ejemplo de la cadena de suministro que especifica la puntualidad, cantidad y calidad de los bienes que deben ser entregados. Por lo tanto, dentro de nuestro modelo de confianza, oa = 1 ahora indica un resultado exitoso sobre la dimensión a del contrato y oa = 0 indica uno no exitoso. Un resultado de contrato, X, está compuesto ahora por un vector de resultados de partes individuales del contrato (por ejemplo, X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . . }). Dado un contrato multidimensional cuyo resultado está descrito por el vector X, consideramos nuevamente que para que un agente tome una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Con este fin, podemos hacer la afirmación general de que la utilidad esperada de un contrato se da por: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) donde p(X) es una distribución conjunta de probabilidad sobre todos los posibles resultados del contrato: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) y U(X) es la utilidad derivada de estos posibles resultados: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) Como antes, mientras que U(X) es conocido por el agente, la distribución de probabilidad p(X) no lo es. Más bien, dada la experiencia directa de los agentes con el proveedor, el agente puede determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(X). En el caso unidimensional, una distribución beta fue la elección natural sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1). En el caso multi-dimensional, donde p(X) en sí mismo es un vector de probabilidades, la elección natural correspondiente es la distribución de Dirichlet, ya que esta es una distribución previa conjugada para proporciones multinomiales [3]. Dada esta distribución, el agente puede calcular una estimación de la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Como antes, esta estimación está representada por un valor esperado dado por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) y una varianza, que describe la incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) donde: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Así, mientras que el caso unidimensional naturalmente conduce a un modelo de confianza en el que los agentes intentan derivar una estimación de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1), junto con una varianza escalar que describe la incertidumbre en esta probabilidad, Var(p(o = 1)), en este caso, los agentes deben derivar una estimación de un vector de probabilidades, ˆp(X), junto con una matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), que representa la incertidumbre en p(X) dadas las consecuencias contractuales observadas. En este punto, es interesante notar que la estimación en el caso unidimensional, ˆp(o = 1), tiene un claro significado semántico en relación con la confianza; es la creencia de los agentes en la probabilidad de que un proveedor cumpla exitosamente un contrato. Sin embargo, en el caso multidimensional, el agente debe determinar ˆp(X), y dado que esto describe la probabilidad de todos los posibles resultados del contrato, incluidos aquellos que no se cumplen en absoluto, esta interpretación semántica directa no está presente. En la siguiente sección, describimos la función de utilidad ejemplar que utilizaremos en el resto de este documento. 4.1 Función de Utilidad Ejemplar El enfoque descrito hasta ahora es completamente general, ya que se aplica a cualquier función de utilidad del tipo descrito anteriormente, y también se aplica a la estimación de cualquier distribución de probabilidad conjunta. En el resto de este documento, con fines ilustrativos, limitaremos la discusión a la función de utilidad más simple posible que muestre una dependencia de las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Es decir, consideramos el caso en el que la utilidad esperada depende solo de las probabilidades marginales de que se cumpla exitosamente cada dimensión del contrato, en lugar de las probabilidades conjuntas completas: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Por lo tanto, ˆp(X) es una estimación vectorial de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se cumpla exitosamente, y mantiene la clara interpretación semántica vista en el caso unidimensional: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) Las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato afectan la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada. Para ver esto, considera la covarianza 1072 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. La matriz que describe esta incertidumbre, Cov(p(X)), en la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se da ahora por: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . . I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab Vb Cbc . . .\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for translation? En esta matriz, los términos diagonales, Va, Vb y Vc, representan las incertidumbres en p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) y p(oc = 1) dentro de p(X). Los términos fuera de la diagonal, Cab, Cac y Cbc, representan las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades. En la siguiente sección, utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular tanto ˆp(X) como Cov(p(X)) a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente en los resultados de contratos anteriores. Primero ilustramos por qué esto es necesario considerando un enfoque alternativo para modelar contratos multidimensionales, en el cual un agente asume ingenuamente que las dimensiones son independientes, y por lo tanto, modela cada una individualmente mediante distribuciones beta separadas (como en el caso unidimensional que presentamos en la sección 3). Esto es en realidad equivalente a establecer los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), a cero. Sin embargo, hacerlo puede llevar a un agente a asumir que su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato es más precisa de lo que en realidad es. Para ilustrar esto, considera un escenario específico con los siguientes valores: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 y Va = Vb = 0.2. En este caso, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), y por lo tanto, si se ignora la correlación Cab, la varianza en la utilidad esperada es de 0.4. Sin embargo, si los resultados del contrato están completamente correlacionados, entonces Cab = 1 y Var(E[U]) es en realidad 0.8. Por lo tanto, para tener una estimación precisa de la varianza de la utilidad del contrato esperada, y para tomar una decisión racional, es esencial que el agente sea capaz de representar y calcular estos términos de correlación. En la siguiente sección, describimos cómo un agente puede hacerlo utilizando la distribución de Dirichlet. 4.2 La Distribución de Dirichlet En esta sección, describimos cómo el agente puede utilizar su experiencia directa de contratos anteriores y los resultados estándar de la distribución de Dirichlet para determinar una estimación de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato sea cumplida exitosamente, ˆp(X), y una medida de las incertidumbres en estas probabilidades que expresa las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato, Cov(p(X)). Primero consideramos el cálculo de ˆp(X) y los términos diagonales de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)). Como se describe arriba, la derivación de estos resultados es idéntica al caso de la distribución beta unidimensional, donde de N resultados de contratos, n se cumplen exitosamente. En el caso multi-dimensional, sin embargo, tenemos un vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} que representa el número de resultados para los cuales se cumplieron con éxito cada una de las dimensiones individuales del contrato. Por lo tanto, en términos de los parámetros estándar de Dirichlet donde αa = na + 1 y α0 = N + 2, el agente puede estimar la probabilidad de que esta dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 y también puede calcular la varianza en cualquier dimensión del contrato: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Sin embargo, calcular los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de Cov(p(X)) es más complejo ya que es necesario considerar las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Por lo tanto, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), debemos considerar todas las posibles combinaciones de resultados de contrato, y así definimos nab ij como el número de resultados de contrato para los cuales tanto oa = i como ob = j. Por ejemplo, nab 10 representa el número de contratos para los cuales oa = 1 y ob = 0. Ahora, utilizando la notación estándar de Dirichlet, podemos definir αab ij nab ij + 1 para todos los i y j que toman valores 0 y 1, y luego, para calcular las correlaciones cruzadas entre los pares de contratos a y b, observamos que la distribución de Dirichlet sobre las probabilidades conjuntas par a par es: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 donde: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 y Kab es una constante de normalización [3]. A partir de esto podemos derivar estimaciones de probabilidad y varianzas por pares: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) donde: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) y de hecho, α0 = N + 2, donde N es el número total de contratos observados. Asimismo, podemos expresar la covarianza en estas probabilidades por pares en términos similares: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0). Finalmente, podemos utilizar la expresión: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) para determinar la covarianza Cab. Para hacerlo, primero simplificamos la notación definiendo V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] y Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)]. La covarianza para la probabilidad de resultados positivos de contrato es entonces la covarianza entre j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) e i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), y por lo tanto: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11. Por lo tanto, dado un conjunto de resultados de contratos que representan las interacciones previas de los agentes con un proveedor, podemos utilizar la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular la media y la varianza de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato (es decir, ˆp(oa = 1) y Va). Además, mediante un procedimiento algo más complejo también podemos calcular las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades (es decir, ... I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab).\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for me to translate to Spanish? Esto nos permite calcular una estimación de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato, ˆp(X), y también representar la incertidumbre y correlaciones en estas probabilidades mediante la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)). A su vez, estos resultados pueden ser utilizados para calcular la estimación y la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada del contrato. En la siguiente sección presentamos resultados empíricos que muestran que en la práctica este formalismo produce mejoras significativas en estas estimaciones en comparación con la aproximación ingenua que utiliza múltiples distribuciones beta independientes. Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de nuestro formalismo y mostrar la importancia de los términos fuera de la diagonal en Cov(p(X)), comparamos dos enfoques: La Sexta Conferencia Internacional.

Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones, y las barras de error muestran el error estándar en la media. • Distribución de Dirichlet: Utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet completa, como se describe arriba, para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), incluyendo todos sus términos fuera de la diagonal que representan las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. • Distribuciones Beta Independientes: Utilizamos distribuciones beta independientes para representar cada dimensión del contrato, con el fin de calcular ˆp(X), y luego, como se describió anteriormente, aproximamos Cov(p(X)) e ignoramos las correlaciones al establecer todos los términos fuera de la diagonal en cero. Consideramos un caso bidimensional donde u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2, ya que esto nos permite trazar ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) como elipses en un plano bidimensional, y así explicar las diferencias entre los dos enfoques. Específicamente, inicialmente asignamos al agente algunos resultados de contratos anteriores que representan su experiencia directa con un proveedor. El número de contratos se elige de forma uniforme entre 10 y 20, y los resultados reales de los contratos se eligen de una distribución conjunta arbitraria destinada a inducir correlaciones entre las dimensiones de los contratos. Para cada conjunto de contratos, utilizamos los enfoques descritos anteriormente para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), y por lo tanto, la varianza en la utilidad esperada del contrato, Var(E[U]). Además, calculamos una medida escalar del contenido de información, I, de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)), que es una forma estándar de medir la incertidumbre codificada dentro de la matriz de covarianza [1]. Más específicamente, calculamos el determinante de la inversa de la matriz de covarianza: I = det(Cov(p(X))−1 ) (16) y observamos que cuanto mayor sea el contenido de información, más precisa será ˆp(X), y por lo tanto, mejor será la estimación de la utilidad esperada que el agente puede calcular. Finalmente, utilizamos los resultados 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 p(o =1) p(o=1) a b Distribución de Dirichlet Distribuciones Beta Independientes Figura 2: Ejemplos de ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) representados como elipses de segundo error estándar. presentados en la sección 4.2 para calcular la correlación real, ρ, asociada con este conjunto particular de resultados de contrato: ρ = Cab √ VaVb (17) donde Cab, Va y Vb se calculan como se describe en la sección 4.2. Los resultados de este análisis se muestran en la figura 1. Aquí mostramos los valores de I y Var(E[U]) calculados por los agentes, representados en función de la correlación de los resultados del contrato, ρ, que constituyeron su experiencia directa. Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones de simulación. Se debe tener en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuando las dimensiones de los resultados del contrato no están correlacionadas (es decir, ρ = 0), ambos enfoques dan los mismos resultados. Sin embargo, el valor de utilizar nuestro formalismo con la distribución de Dirichlet completa se muestra cuando la correlación entre las dimensiones aumenta (ya sea de forma negativa o positiva). Como se puede observar, si aproximamos la distribución de Dirichlet con múltiples distribuciones beta independientes, toda la información de correlación contenida en la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), se pierde, y por lo tanto, el contenido informativo de la matriz es mucho menor. La pérdida de esta información de correlación hace que la varianza de la utilidad esperada del contrato sea incorrecta (ya sea sobreestimada o subestimada dependiendo de la correlación), con la cantidad exacta de subestimación dependiendo de la función de utilidad real elegida (es decir, los valores de u(oa = 1) y u(ob = 1)). Además, en la figura 2 ilustramos un ejemplo de las estimaciones calculadas a través de ambos métodos, para un único conjunto de resultados de contratos. Representamos las estimaciones de probabilidad, ˆp(X), y la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), de la manera estándar como una elipse [1]. Es decir, ˆp(X) determina la posición del centro de la elipse, Cov(p(X)) define su tamaño y forma. Cabe destacar que si bien la elipse resultante del formalismo completo de Dirichlet refleja con precisión la verdadera distribución (cuyas muestras se representan como puntos), la calculada al utilizar múltiples distribuciones Beta independientes (y por lo tanto ignorando las correlaciones) resulta en una elipse mucho más grande que no refleja la verdadera distribución. El tamaño más grande de esta elipse es resultado de que los términos fuera de la diagonal de la matriz de covarianza se establecieron en cero, y corresponde a que el agente calculó erróneamente la incertidumbre en la probabilidad de que se cumpla cada dimensión del contrato. Esto, a su vez, hace que se calcule de forma incorrecta la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada de un contrato (mostrada en la figura 1 como Var(E[U]). 5. COMUNICANDO REPUTACIÓN Habiendo descrito cómo un agente individual puede utilizar su propia experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para estimar la probabilidad. Nota que las gráficas no son suaves debido al hecho de que, dado un número limitado de resultados de contratos, la media de Va y Vb no varía suavemente con ρ. 1074 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), ahora pasamos a considerar cómo los agentes dentro de un sistema multiagente abierto pueden comunicar estas estimaciones entre sí. Esto se conoce comúnmente como reputación y permite a los agentes con experiencia directa limitada de un proveedor tomar decisiones racionales. Tanto Jøsang e Ismail, como Teacy y colaboradores, presentan modelos en los que la reputación se comunica entre agentes utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta [6, 11]. Este enfoque es atractivo ya que estas estadísticas suficientes son simples agregaciones de los resultados de los contratos (más precisamente, simplemente son el número total de contratos observados, N, y el número de estos que se cumplieron exitosamente, n). Bajo el marco probabilístico de la distribución beta, los informes de reputación en esta forma simplemente pueden ser agregados con la propia experiencia directa de un agente, con el fin de obtener una estimación más precisa basada en un conjunto más amplio de resultados de contratos. Podemos extender inmediatamente este enfoque al caso multidimensional considerado aquí, al requerir que los agentes intercambien las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet en lugar de la distribución beta. En este caso, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), los agentes deben comunicar un vector de resultados de contrato, N, que son las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet, dadas por: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Por lo tanto, un agente puede comunicar las estadísticas suficientes de su propia distribución de Dirichlet en términos de solo 2d(d − 1) números (donde d es el número de dimensiones de contrato). Por ejemplo, en el caso de tres dimensiones, N, se da por: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > y, por lo tanto, conjuntos grandes de resultados de contratos pueden ser comunicados dentro de un tamaño de mensaje relativamente pequeño, sin pérdida de información. Una vez más, los agentes que reciben estas estadísticas suficientes pueden simplemente agregarlas a su propia experiencia directa para obtener una estimación más precisa de la confiabilidad de un proveedor. Finalmente, cabe destacar que si bien no es el enfoque de nuestro trabajo aquí, al adoptar el mismo enfoque basado en principios que Jøsang e Ismail, y Teacy y otros, muchas de las técnicas que han desarrollado (como descontar informes de agentes no confiables y filtrar informes inconsistentes de agentes egoístas) pueden aplicarse directamente dentro de este modelo multidimensional. Sin embargo, ahora pasamos a considerar un nuevo problema que surge tanto en los modelos unidimensionales como multidimensionales, a saber, los problemas que surgen cuando dichas estadísticas suficientes agregadas se propagan dentro de redes de agentes descentralizados. 6. PROPAGACIÓN DE RUMORES DENTRO DE SISTEMAS DE REPUTACIÓN En la sección anterior, describimos el uso de estadísticas suficientes para comunicar la reputación, y demostramos que al agregar los resultados de los contratos en estas estadísticas suficientes, se puede representar y comunicar un gran número de resultados de contratos de forma compacta. Si bien esta es una propiedad atractiva, puede ser problemática en la práctica, ya que la procedencia individual de cada resultado de contrato se pierde en la agregación. Por lo tanto, para garantizar una estimación precisa, el sistema de reputación debe asegurarse de que cada observación de un resultado de contrato se incluya en las estadísticas agregadas no más de una vez. Dentro de un sistema de reputación centralizado, donde todos los agentes informan sus experiencias directas a un centro de confianza, es fácil evitar el doble conteo de resultados de contratos. Sin embargo, en un sistema de reputación descentralizado, donde los agentes comunican la reputación entre sí y agregan su experiencia directa con estos informes de reputación sobre la marcha, evitar el doble conteo es mucho más difícil. Por ejemplo, considera el caso mostrado en la figura 3 donde tres agentes (a1 . . . a3), cada uno con cierta experiencia directa de un proveedor, comparten informes de reputación sobre este proveedor. Si el agente a1 proporcionara su estimación a los agentes a2 y a3 en forma de las estadísticas suficientes de su distribución de Dirichlet, entonces estos agentes pueden agregar estos resultados contractuales con los suyos propios, y así obtener estimaciones más precisas. Si en una etapa posterior, el agente a2 enviara su vector agregado de resultados de contratos al agente a3, entonces el agente a3, al no estar al tanto de toda la historia de intercambios, podría intentar combinar estos resultados de contratos con su propio vector agregado. Sin embargo, dado que ambos vectores contienen una contribución del agente a1, estos serán contados dos veces en el vector agregado final, lo que resultará en una estimación sesgada y excesivamente confiada. Esto se denomina propagación de rumores o incesto de datos en la literatura de fusión de datos [9]. Una posible solución sería identificar de manera única la fuente de cada resultado de contrato, y luego propagar cada vector, junto con su etiqueta, a través de la red. Los agentes pueden identificar así observaciones idénticas que han llegado por diferentes rutas, y después de eliminar los duplicados, pueden agregarlos juntos para formar sus estimaciones. Si bien esto parece atractivo en principio, por varias razones, no siempre es una solución viable en la práctica [12]. En primer lugar, los agentes pueden no desear que sus resultados de contrato etiquetados de manera única se compartan en un sistema abierto, ya que dicha información puede tener importancia comercial o práctica que podría ser utilizada en su contra. Por lo tanto, es posible que los agentes solo estén dispuestos a intercambiar resultados de contratos identificables con un pequeño número de otros agentes (quizás aquellos con los que tengan algún tipo de relación recíproca). En segundo lugar, el hecho de que no haya una agregación de los resultados del contrato a medida que circulan por la red significa que el tamaño del mensaje aumenta con el tiempo, y el tamaño final de estos mensajes está limitado únicamente por el número de agentes dentro del sistema (posiblemente un número extremadamente grande para un sistema global). Finalmente, puede resultar realmente difícil asignar etiquetas globalmente aceptables, consistentes y únicas para cada agente dentro de un sistema abierto. En la siguiente sección, desarrollamos una solución novedosa al problema de la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Nuestra solución se basa en un enfoque desarrollado dentro del área de seguimiento de objetivos y fusión de datos [9]. Evita la necesidad de identificar de forma única a un agente, permite a los agentes restringir la cantidad de otros agentes a los que revelan sus estimaciones privadas, y aún así permite que la información se propague por toda la red. 6.1 Información Privada y Compartida Nuestra solución para la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados introduce la noción de información privada que un agente sabe que no ha comunicado a ningún otro agente, y de información compartida que ha sido comunicada a, o recibida de, otro agente. Por lo tanto, el agente puede descomponer su vector de resultado de contrato, N, en dos vectores, uno privado, Np, que no ha sido comunicado a otro agente, y uno compartido, Ns, que ha sido compartido con, o recibido de, otro agente: N = Np + Ns (19). Ahora, cada vez que un agente comunica la reputación, comunica ambos vectores privados y compartidos por separado. Ambos el origEl Sexto Intl. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), los agentes emisores y receptores actualizan sus dos vectores de manera apropiada. Para entender esto, considera el caso en el que el agente aα envía sus vectores de resultados de contrato privados y compartidos, Nα p y Nα s, al agente aβ que a su vez tiene resultados de contrato privados y compartidos Nβ p y Nβ s. Cada agente actualiza sus vectores de resultados de contrato de acuerdo con el siguiente procedimiento: • Agente de origen: Una vez que el agente de origen ha enviado tanto sus vectores de resultados de contrato compartidos como privados a otro agente, su información privada ya no es privada. Por lo tanto, debe eliminar los resultados de contrato que estaban en su vector privado y agregarlos a su vector compartido: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Agente Receptor: El objetivo del agente receptor es acumular el mayor número de resultados de contrato (ya que esto resultará en la estimación más precisa) sin incluir información compartida tanto de sí mismo como del otro agente (ya que esto podría resultar en la duplicación de resultados de contrato). Tiene dos opciones dependiendo del número total de resultados de contrato dentro de su propio vector compartido, Nβ s , y dentro del del agente de origen, Nα s. Así, actualiza su vector de acuerdo con el procedimiento siguiente: - Nβ s > Nα s: Si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un mayor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente combina su vector compartido con el vector privado del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. - Nβ s < Nα s: Alternativamente, si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un menor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente receptor descarta su propio vector compartido y forma uno nuevo a partir de los vectores privado y compartido del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. En caso de que Nβ s = Nα s, entonces cualquiera de las opciones es apropiada. Una vez que el agente receptor ha actualizado sus conjuntos, utiliza los resultados del contrato en ambos para formar su estimación de confianza. Si los agentes reciben varios vectores simultáneamente, este enfoque se generaliza al agente receptor utilizando el vector compartido más grande, y los vectores privados de sí mismo y de todos los agentes originales para formar su nuevo vector compartido. Este procedimiento tiene varias propiedades atractivas. En primer lugar, dado que los resultados de los contratos en un vector compartido de agentes nunca se combinan con los de otro agente en el vector compartido, los resultados que provienen del mismo agente nunca se combinan entre sí, y por lo tanto, la propagación de rumores se evita por completo. Sin embargo, dado que el agente receptor puede descartar su propio vector compartido y adoptar el vector compartido del agente de origen, la información sigue propagándose por la red. Además, dado que los resultados de los contratos se agregan juntos dentro de los vectores privados y compartidos, el tamaño del mensaje es constante y no aumenta a medida que aumenta el número de interacciones. Finalmente, un agente solo comunica los resultados de su propio contrato privado a sus vecinos inmediatos. Si este agente 6 lo transmite posteriormente, lo hace como información agregada no identificable dentro de su información compartida. Por lo tanto, un agente puede limitar el número de agentes con los que está dispuesto a revelar resultados de contratos identificables, y sin embargo, estos resultados de contratos aún pueden propagarse dentro de la red, y así mejorar las estimaciones de otros agentes. A continuación, demostramos empíricamente que estas propiedades pueden ser realizadas en la práctica. 6.2 Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de este procedimiento, simulamos redes aleatorias compuestas por diez agentes. Cada agente tiene cierta experiencia directa de interactuar con un proveedor (como se describe en la sección 4.3). En cada iteración de la simulación, interactúa con sus vecinos inmediatos y intercambia informes de reputación a través de las estadísticas suficientes de sus distribuciones de Dirichlet. Comparamos nuestra solución con dos de las alternativas descentralizadas más obvias: • Información Privada y Compartida: Los agentes siguen el procedimiento descrito en la sección anterior. Es decir, mantienen vectores separados privados y compartidos de resultados de contrato, y en cada iteración comunican ambos vectores a sus vecinos inmediatos. • Propagación de rumores: Los agentes no diferencian entre resultados de contrato privados y compartidos. En la primera iteración comunican todos los resultados del contrato que constituyen su experiencia directa. En iteraciones posteriores, propagan los resultados de los contratos que reciben de cualquiera de los vecinos a todos sus otros vecinos inmediatos. • Solo Información Privada: Los agentes solo comunican los resultados de los contratos que constituyen su experiencia directa. En todos los casos, en cada iteración, los agentes utilizan la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular sus estimaciones de confianza. Comparamos estos tres enfoques descentralizados con un sistema de reputación centralizado: • Reputación Centralizada: Todos los agentes transmiten su experiencia directa a un sistema de reputación centralizado que las agrega y devuelve esta estimación a cada agente. Esta solución centralizada hace el uso más efectivo de la información disponible en la red. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los problemas del mundo real requieren soluciones descentralizadas debido a preocupaciones de escalabilidad, modularidad y comunicación. Por lo tanto, esta solución centralizada se incluye ya que representa el caso óptimo, y nos permite comparar nuestra solución descentralizada. Los resultados de estas comparaciones se muestran en la figura 4. Aquí mostramos la suma del contenido de información de la matriz de covarianza de cada agente (calculada como se discutió anteriormente en la sección 4.3), para cada uno de estos cuatro enfoques diferentes. Primero observamos que cuando solo se comunica información privada, no hay cambio en la información después de la primera iteración. Una vez que cada agente ha recibido la experiencia directa de sus vecinos inmediatos, no se puede lograr un aumento adicional en la información. Esto representa la comunicación mínima y exhibe la menor cantidad total de información de los cuatro casos. A continuación, observamos que en el caso de la propagación de rumores, el contenido de la información aumenta continuamente y supera rápidamente el resultado de la reputación centralizada. El hecho de que el caso de propagación de rumores exceda incorrectamente este límite indica que está contando continuamente los mismos resultados de contrato a medida que circulan por la red, creyendo que son eventos independientes. Finalmente, observamos que el uso de información privada y compartida representa un compromiso entre el caso de solo información privada y el caso de reputación centralizada. La información todavía se permite propagar por la red, sin embargo los rumores son eliminados. Como antes, también representamos una única instancia de las estimaciones de confianza de un agente (es decir, ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X))) como un conjunto de elipses en un 1076 The Sixth Intl.

Como era de esperar, el sistema de reputación centralizado logra la mejor estimación de la distribución real, ya que utiliza la experiencia directa de todos los agentes. El caso de información privada muestra la elipse más grande ya que propaga la menor cantidad de información alrededor de la red. El caso de propagación de rumores muestra la elipse más pequeña, pero es inconsistente con la distribución real p(X). Por lo tanto, propagar rumores en la red y contar dos veces los resultados de los contratos creyendo que son eventos independientes, resulta en una estimación excesivamente confiada. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución, utilizando vectores separados de información privada y compartida, nos permite propagar más información que en el caso de solo información privada, pero evitamos por completo los problemas de propagación de rumores. Finalmente, consideramos el efecto que esto tiene en el cálculo del valor esperado de utilidad del contrato por parte de los agentes. Suponemos la misma función de utilidad que se utilizó en la sección 4.3 (es decir, u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2), y en la tabla 1 presentamos la estimación de la utilidad esperada y su desviación estándar calculada para los cuatro casos por un único agente en la quinta iteración (después de que la comunicación haya dejado de tener efecto adicional para todos los métodos excepto la propagación de rumores). Observamos que el caso de propagación de rumores es claramente inconsistente con el sistema de reputación centralizado, ya que su desviación estándar es demasiado pequeña y no refleja la verdadera incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada, dadas las consecuencias del contrato. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución representa el caso más cercano al sistema de reputación centralizado, y por lo tanto logra propagar la información a lo largo de la red, evitando al mismo tiempo el sesgo y la sobreconfianza. La diferencia exacta entre esto y el sistema de reputación centralizado depende de la topología de la red y de la historia de intercambios que tienen lugar dentro de ella. 7. CONCLUSIONES En este artículo abordamos la necesidad de un modelo probabilístico fundamentado de confianza computacional que maneje contratos con múltiples dimensiones correlacionadas. Nuestro punto de partida fue un agente que estimaba la utilidad esperada de un contrato, y demostramos que esto conduce a un modelo de confianza computacional que utiliza la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular una estimación de confianza a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente. Luego mostramos cómo los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para representar y comunicar la reputación dentro de un sistema de reputación descentralizado, y presentamos una solución a la propagación de rumores dentro de estos sistemas. Nuestro trabajo futuro en esta área es extender el intercambio de reputación al caso en el que los contratos no son homogéneos. Es decir, no todos los agentes observan las mismas dimensiones del contrato. Esta es una extensión desafiante, ya que en este caso, las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet no pueden ser utilizadas directamente.

                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
                "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
                "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",
                "To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",
                "The starting point for our work is to consider how an agent can estimate the utility that it will derive from interacting with a supplier.",
                "Here we use standard approaches from the literature of data fusion (since this is a well developed field where the notion of multi-dimensional correlated estimates is well established1 ) to show that this naturally leads to a trust model where the agent must estimate probabilities and correlations over 1 In this context, the multiple dimensions typically represent the physical coordinates of a target being tracked, and correlations arise through the operation and orientation of sensors. 1070 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS multiple dimensions.",

                "In his case, each dimension is scored as a real number that represents a comparative value with no strong semantic meaning.",
                "He develops an heuristic rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers.",

                "They define multidimensional goal requirements, and evaluate an expected payoff based on a suppliers estimated behaviour.",
                "These estimates are, however, simple aggregations over the direct experience of several agents, and there is no measure of the uncertainty.",
                "Nevertheless, they show that agents who select suppliers based on these multiple dimensions outperform those who consider just a single one.",
                "By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension.",
                "Jøsang and Ismail describe the Beta Reputation System whereby the reputation of an agent is compiled from the positive and negative reports from other agents who have interacted with it [6].",
                "The beta distribution represents a natural choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a principled means of representing uncertainty.",
                "Moreover, they provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques to deal with reputations that may change over time.",
                "Likewise, Teacy et al. use the beta distribution to describe an agents belief in the probability that another agent will successfully fulfill its commitments [11].",
                "They present a formalism using a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other agents.",
                "They provide a number of extensions to this initial model, and, in particular, they consider that agents may not always truthfully report their trust estimates.",
                "Thus, they present a principled approach to detecting and removing inconsistent reports.",
                "Our work builds upon these more principled approaches.",
                "However, the starting point of our approach is to consider an agent that is attempting to estimate the expected utility of a contract.",
                "We show that estimating this expected utility requires that an agent must estimate the probability with which the supplier will fulfill its contract.",
                "In the single-dimensional case, this naturally leads to a trust model using the beta distribution (as per Jøsang and Ismail and Teacy et al.).",
                "However, we then go on to extend this analysis to multiple dimensions, where we use the natural extension of the beta distribution, namely the Dirichlet distribution, to represent the agents belief over multiple dimensions. 3.",
                "SINGLE-DIMENSIONAL TRUST Before presenting our multi-dimensional trust model, we first introduce the notation and formalism that we will use by describing the more familiar single dimensional case.",

                "This contract will lead to some outcome, o, and we consider that o = 1 if the contract is successfully fulfilled, and o = 0 if not2 .",
                "In order for the agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract.",

                "Now, given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the supplier will fulfill the contract, it should consider the expected utility that it will derive, E[U], and this is given by: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) where p(o = 1) is the probability that the supplier will successfully fulfill the contract.",
                "However, whilst u(o = 1) is known by the agent, p(o = 1) is not.",
                "The best the agent can do is to determine a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct experience of previous contract outcomes.",
                "Given that it has been able to do so, it can then determine an estimate of the expected utility4 of the contract, E[E[U]], and a measure of its uncertainty in this expected utility, Var(E[U]).",
                "This uncertainty is important since a risk averse agent may make a decision regarding a contract, 2 Note that we only consider binary contract outcomes, although extending this to partial outcomes is part of our future work. 3 Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is derived from an unsuccessful outcome. 4 Note that this is often called the expected expected utility, and this is the notation that we adopt here [2].",

                "The utility based approach that we present here provides an attractive motivation for this model of Teacy et al. [11].",
                "Now, in the case of binary contract outcomes, the beta distribution is the natural choice to represent the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) since within Bayesian statistics this well known to be the conjugate prior for binomial observations [3].",
                "By adopting the beta distribution, we can calculate ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) using standard results, and thus, if an agent observed N previous contracts of which n were successfully fulfilled, then: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 and: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Note that as expected, the greater the number of contracts the agent observes, the smaller the variance term Var(p(o = 1)), and, thus, the less the uncertainty regarding the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1). 4.",
                "MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TRUST We now extend the description above, to consider contracts between suppliers and agents that are represented by multiple dimensions, and hence the success or failure of a contract can be decomposed into the success or failure of each separate dimension.",
                "Consider again the example of the supply chain that specifies the timeliness, quantity, and quality of the goods that are to be delivered.",
                "Thus, within our trust model oa = 1 now indicates a successful outcome over dimension a of the contract and oa = 0 indicates an unsuccessful one.",
                "A contract outcome, X, is now composed of a vector of individual contract part outcomes (e.g.",

                "Given a multi-dimensional contract whose outcome is described by the vector X, we again consider that in order for an agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract.",
                "To this end, we can make the general statement that the expected utility of a contract is given by: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) where p(X) is a joint probability distribution over all possible contract outcomes: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) and U(X) is the utility derived from these possible outcomes: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) As before, whilst U(X) is known to the agent, the probability distribution p(X) is not.",
                "Rather, given the agents direct experience of the supplier, the agent can determine a distribution over possible values for p(X).",
                "In the single dimensional case, a beta distribution was the natural choice over possible values of p(o = 1).",
                "In the multi-dimensional case, where p(X) itself is a vector of probabilities, the corresponding natural choice is the Dirichlet distribution, since this is a conjugate prior for multinomial proportions [3].",
                "Given this distribution, the agent is then able to calculate an estimate of the expected utility of a contract.",
                "As before, this estimate is itself represented by an expected value given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) and a variance, describing the uncertainty in this expected utility: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) where: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Thus, whilst the single dimensional case naturally leads to a trust model in which the agents attempt to derive an estimate of probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1), along with a scalar variance that describes the uncertainty in this probability, Var(p(o = 1)), in this case, the agents must derive an estimate of a vector of probabilities, ˆp(X), along with a covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), that represents the uncertainty in p(X) given the observed contractual outcomes.",
                "At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract.",

                "Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j.",

INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la <br>sobreconfianza</br>. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Él desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5]. Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión. Jøsang e Ismail describen el Sistema de Reputación Beta, en el cual la reputación de un agente se compila a partir de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6]. La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio fundamentado para representar la incertidumbre. Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluyen un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descontar las opiniones de agentes que tienen calificaciones de reputación bajas, y técnicas para manejar reputaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo. Asimismo, Teacy et al. utilizan la distribución beta para describir la creencia de un agente en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla exitosamente con sus compromisos [11]. Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad basándose en su experiencia directa, y nuevamente utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes. Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial, y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan con veracidad sus estimaciones de confianza. Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque basado en principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes. Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más fundamentados. Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato. En el caso unidimensional, esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.). Sin embargo, luego pasamos a extender este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, es decir, la distribución de Dirichlet, para representar la creencia de los agentes sobre múltiples dimensiones. 3. CONFIANZA UNIDIMENSIONAL Antes de presentar nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional, primero introducimos la notación y el formalismo que utilizaremos describiendo el caso más familiar unidimensional. Consideramos a un agente que debe decidir si comprometerse en un contrato futuro con un proveedor. Este contrato llevará a algún resultado, o, y consideramos que o = 1 si el contrato se cumple con éxito, y o = 0 si no. Para que el agente pueda tomar una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Suponemos que en caso de que el contrato se cumpla con éxito, el agente obtiene una utilidad u(o = 1), de lo contrario no recibe ninguna utilidad. Ahora, dado que el agente no está seguro de la fiabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá el contrato, debería considerar la utilidad esperada que obtendrá, E[U], y esto se da por: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) donde p(o = 1) es la probabilidad de que el proveedor cumpla exitosamente con el contrato. Sin embargo, aunque el agente conoce u(o = 1), no conoce p(o = 1). Lo mejor que el agente puede hacer es determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1) dados sus experiencias directas de resultados de contratos anteriores. Dado que ha sido capaz de hacerlo, puede entonces determinar una estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, E[E[U]], y una medida de su incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada, Var(E[U]). Esta incertidumbre es importante ya que un agente adverso al riesgo puede tomar una decisión con respecto a un contrato. Nota que solo consideramos resultados de contratos binarios, aunque extender esto a resultados parciales es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro. Claramente esto puede extenderse al caso en el que se derive cierta utilidad de un resultado no exitoso. Nota que esto a menudo se llama la utilidad esperada esperada, y esta es la notación que adoptamos aquí. El Sexto Internacional. La Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) no solo se basa en su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, sino también en la probabilidad de que la utilidad esperada supere cierta cantidad mínima. Estas dos propiedades se dan por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) donde ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) son la estimación y la incertidumbre de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, y se calculan a partir de la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) que el agente determina a partir de su experiencia directa. El enfoque basado en utilidad que presentamos aquí proporciona una motivación atractiva para este modelo de Teacy et al. [11]. Ahora, en el caso de resultados de contratos binarios, la distribución beta es la elección natural para representar la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) ya que dentro de la estadística bayesiana se sabe que es la distribución previa conjugada para observaciones binomiales [3]. Al adoptar la distribución beta, podemos calcular ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) utilizando resultados estándar, y así, si un agente observó N contratos anteriores de los cuales n se cumplieron con éxito, entonces: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 y: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Tenga en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuanto mayor sea el número de contratos que el agente observa, menor será el término de varianza Var(p(o = 1)), y, por lo tanto, menor será la incertidumbre con respecto a la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1). CONFIANZA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL Ahora extendemos la descripción anterior para considerar contratos entre proveedores y agentes que están representados por múltiples dimensiones, por lo que el éxito o fracaso de un contrato puede descomponerse en el éxito o fracaso de cada dimensión por separado. Considera nuevamente el ejemplo de la cadena de suministro que especifica la puntualidad, cantidad y calidad de los bienes que deben ser entregados. Por lo tanto, dentro de nuestro modelo de confianza, oa = 1 ahora indica un resultado exitoso sobre la dimensión a del contrato y oa = 0 indica uno no exitoso. Un resultado de contrato, X, está compuesto ahora por un vector de resultados de partes individuales del contrato (por ejemplo, X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . . }). Dado un contrato multidimensional cuyo resultado está descrito por el vector X, consideramos nuevamente que para que un agente tome una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Con este fin, podemos hacer la afirmación general de que la utilidad esperada de un contrato se da por: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) donde p(X) es una distribución conjunta de probabilidad sobre todos los posibles resultados del contrato: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) y U(X) es la utilidad derivada de estos posibles resultados: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) Como antes, mientras que U(X) es conocido por el agente, la distribución de probabilidad p(X) no lo es. Más bien, dada la experiencia directa de los agentes con el proveedor, el agente puede determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(X). En el caso unidimensional, una distribución beta fue la elección natural sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1). En el caso multi-dimensional, donde p(X) en sí mismo es un vector de probabilidades, la elección natural correspondiente es la distribución de Dirichlet, ya que esta es una distribución previa conjugada para proporciones multinomiales [3]. Dada esta distribución, el agente puede calcular una estimación de la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Como antes, esta estimación está representada por un valor esperado dado por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) y una varianza, que describe la incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) donde: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Así, mientras que el caso unidimensional naturalmente conduce a un modelo de confianza en el que los agentes intentan derivar una estimación de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1), junto con una varianza escalar que describe la incertidumbre en esta probabilidad, Var(p(o = 1)), en este caso, los agentes deben derivar una estimación de un vector de probabilidades, ˆp(X), junto con una matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), que representa la incertidumbre en p(X) dadas las consecuencias contractuales observadas. En este punto, es interesante notar que la estimación en el caso unidimensional, ˆp(o = 1), tiene un claro significado semántico en relación con la confianza; es la creencia de los agentes en la probabilidad de que un proveedor cumpla exitosamente un contrato. Sin embargo, en el caso multidimensional, el agente debe determinar ˆp(X), y dado que esto describe la probabilidad de todos los posibles resultados del contrato, incluidos aquellos que no se cumplen en absoluto, esta interpretación semántica directa no está presente. En la siguiente sección, describimos la función de utilidad ejemplar que utilizaremos en el resto de este documento. 4.1 Función de Utilidad Ejemplar El enfoque descrito hasta ahora es completamente general, ya que se aplica a cualquier función de utilidad del tipo descrito anteriormente, y también se aplica a la estimación de cualquier distribución de probabilidad conjunta. En el resto de este documento, con fines ilustrativos, limitaremos la discusión a la función de utilidad más simple posible que muestre una dependencia de las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Es decir, consideramos el caso en el que la utilidad esperada depende solo de las probabilidades marginales de que se cumpla exitosamente cada dimensión del contrato, en lugar de las probabilidades conjuntas completas: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Por lo tanto, ˆp(X) es una estimación vectorial de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se cumpla exitosamente, y mantiene la clara interpretación semántica vista en el caso unidimensional: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) Las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato afectan la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada. Para ver esto, considera la covarianza 1072 de la Sexta Conferencia Internacional. La matriz que describe esta incertidumbre, Cov(p(X)), en la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) se da ahora por: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . . I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab Vb Cbc . . .\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for translation? En esta matriz, los términos diagonales, Va, Vb y Vc, representan las incertidumbres en p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) y p(oc = 1) dentro de p(X). Los términos fuera de la diagonal, Cab, Cac y Cbc, representan las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades. En la siguiente sección, utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular tanto ˆp(X) como Cov(p(X)) a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente en los resultados de contratos anteriores. Primero ilustramos por qué esto es necesario considerando un enfoque alternativo para modelar contratos multidimensionales, en el cual un agente asume ingenuamente que las dimensiones son independientes, y por lo tanto, modela cada una individualmente mediante distribuciones beta separadas (como en el caso unidimensional que presentamos en la sección 3). Esto es en realidad equivalente a establecer los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), a cero. Sin embargo, hacerlo puede llevar a un agente a asumir que su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato es más precisa de lo que en realidad es. Para ilustrar esto, considera un escenario específico con los siguientes valores: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 y Va = Vb = 0.2. En este caso, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), y por lo tanto, si se ignora la correlación Cab, la varianza en la utilidad esperada es de 0.4. Sin embargo, si los resultados del contrato están completamente correlacionados, entonces Cab = 1 y Var(E[U]) es en realidad 0.8. Por lo tanto, para tener una estimación precisa de la varianza de la utilidad del contrato esperada, y para tomar una decisión racional, es esencial que el agente sea capaz de representar y calcular estos términos de correlación. En la siguiente sección, describimos cómo un agente puede hacerlo utilizando la distribución de Dirichlet. 4.2 La Distribución de Dirichlet En esta sección, describimos cómo el agente puede utilizar su experiencia directa de contratos anteriores y los resultados estándar de la distribución de Dirichlet para determinar una estimación de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato sea cumplida exitosamente, ˆp(X), y una medida de las incertidumbres en estas probabilidades que expresa las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato, Cov(p(X)). Primero consideramos el cálculo de ˆp(X) y los términos diagonales de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)). Como se describe arriba, la derivación de estos resultados es idéntica al caso de la distribución beta unidimensional, donde de N resultados de contratos, n se cumplen exitosamente. En el caso multi-dimensional, sin embargo, tenemos un vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} que representa el número de resultados para los cuales se cumplieron con éxito cada una de las dimensiones individuales del contrato. Por lo tanto, en términos de los parámetros estándar de Dirichlet donde αa = na + 1 y α0 = N + 2, el agente puede estimar la probabilidad de que esta dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 y también puede calcular la varianza en cualquier dimensión del contrato: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Sin embargo, calcular los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de Cov(p(X)) es más complejo ya que es necesario considerar las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Por lo tanto, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), debemos considerar todas las posibles combinaciones de resultados de contrato, y así definimos nab ij como el número de resultados de contrato para los cuales tanto oa = i como ob = j. Por ejemplo, nab 10 representa el número de contratos para los cuales oa = 1 y ob = 0. Ahora, utilizando la notación estándar de Dirichlet, podemos definir αab ij nab ij + 1 para todos los i y j que toman valores 0 y 1, y luego, para calcular las correlaciones cruzadas entre los pares de contratos a y b, observamos que la distribución de Dirichlet sobre las probabilidades conjuntas par a par es: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 donde: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 y Kab es una constante de normalización [3]. A partir de esto podemos derivar estimaciones de probabilidad y varianzas por pares: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) donde: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) y de hecho, α0 = N + 2, donde N es el número total de contratos observados. Asimismo, podemos expresar la covarianza en estas probabilidades por pares en términos similares: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0). Finalmente, podemos utilizar la expresión: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) para determinar la covarianza Cab. Para hacerlo, primero simplificamos la notación definiendo V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] y Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)]. La covarianza para la probabilidad de resultados positivos de contrato es entonces la covarianza entre j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) e i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), y por lo tanto: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11. Por lo tanto, dado un conjunto de resultados de contratos que representan las interacciones previas de los agentes con un proveedor, podemos utilizar la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular la media y la varianza de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato (es decir, ˆp(oa = 1) y Va). Además, mediante un procedimiento algo más complejo también podemos calcular las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades (es decir, ... I'm sorry, but the sentence \"Cab).\" does not make sense in English. Could you please provide a different sentence for me to translate to Spanish? Esto nos permite calcular una estimación de la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cualquier dimensión del contrato, ˆp(X), y también representar la incertidumbre y correlaciones en estas probabilidades mediante la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)). A su vez, estos resultados pueden ser utilizados para calcular la estimación y la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada del contrato. En la siguiente sección presentamos resultados empíricos que muestran que en la práctica este formalismo produce mejoras significativas en estas estimaciones en comparación con la aproximación ingenua que utiliza múltiples distribuciones beta independientes. Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de nuestro formalismo y mostrar la importancia de los términos fuera de la diagonal en Cov(p(X)), comparamos dos enfoques: La Sexta Conferencia Internacional.

Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones, y las barras de error muestran el error estándar en la media. • Distribución de Dirichlet: Utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet completa, como se describe arriba, para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), incluyendo todos sus términos fuera de la diagonal que representan las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. • Distribuciones Beta Independientes: Utilizamos distribuciones beta independientes para representar cada dimensión del contrato, con el fin de calcular ˆp(X), y luego, como se describió anteriormente, aproximamos Cov(p(X)) e ignoramos las correlaciones al establecer todos los términos fuera de la diagonal en cero. Consideramos un caso bidimensional donde u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2, ya que esto nos permite trazar ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) como elipses en un plano bidimensional, y así explicar las diferencias entre los dos enfoques. Específicamente, inicialmente asignamos al agente algunos resultados de contratos anteriores que representan su experiencia directa con un proveedor. El número de contratos se elige de forma uniforme entre 10 y 20, y los resultados reales de los contratos se eligen de una distribución conjunta arbitraria destinada a inducir correlaciones entre las dimensiones de los contratos. Para cada conjunto de contratos, utilizamos los enfoques descritos anteriormente para calcular ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)), y por lo tanto, la varianza en la utilidad esperada del contrato, Var(E[U]). Además, calculamos una medida escalar del contenido de información, I, de la matriz de covarianza Cov(p(X)), que es una forma estándar de medir la incertidumbre codificada dentro de la matriz de covarianza [1]. Más específicamente, calculamos el determinante de la inversa de la matriz de covarianza: I = det(Cov(p(X))−1 ) (16) y observamos que cuanto mayor sea el contenido de información, más precisa será ˆp(X), y por lo tanto, mejor será la estimación de la utilidad esperada que el agente puede calcular. Finalmente, utilizamos los resultados 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 p(o =1) p(o=1) a b Distribución de Dirichlet Distribuciones Beta Independientes Figura 2: Ejemplos de ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X)) representados como elipses de segundo error estándar. presentados en la sección 4.2 para calcular la correlación real, ρ, asociada con este conjunto particular de resultados de contrato: ρ = Cab √ VaVb (17) donde Cab, Va y Vb se calculan como se describe en la sección 4.2. Los resultados de este análisis se muestran en la figura 1. Aquí mostramos los valores de I y Var(E[U]) calculados por los agentes, representados en función de la correlación de los resultados del contrato, ρ, que constituyeron su experiencia directa. Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones de simulación. Se debe tener en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuando las dimensiones de los resultados del contrato no están correlacionadas (es decir, ρ = 0), ambos enfoques dan los mismos resultados. Sin embargo, el valor de utilizar nuestro formalismo con la distribución de Dirichlet completa se muestra cuando la correlación entre las dimensiones aumenta (ya sea de forma negativa o positiva). Como se puede observar, si aproximamos la distribución de Dirichlet con múltiples distribuciones beta independientes, toda la información de correlación contenida en la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), se pierde, y por lo tanto, el contenido informativo de la matriz es mucho menor. La pérdida de esta información de correlación hace que la varianza de la utilidad esperada del contrato sea incorrecta (ya sea sobreestimada o subestimada dependiendo de la correlación), con la cantidad exacta de subestimación dependiendo de la función de utilidad real elegida (es decir, los valores de u(oa = 1) y u(ob = 1)). Además, en la figura 2 ilustramos un ejemplo de las estimaciones calculadas a través de ambos métodos, para un único conjunto de resultados de contratos. Representamos las estimaciones de probabilidad, ˆp(X), y la matriz de covarianza, Cov(p(X)), de la manera estándar como una elipse [1]. Es decir, ˆp(X) determina la posición del centro de la elipse, Cov(p(X)) define su tamaño y forma. Cabe destacar que si bien la elipse resultante del formalismo completo de Dirichlet refleja con precisión la verdadera distribución (cuyas muestras se representan como puntos), la calculada al utilizar múltiples distribuciones Beta independientes (y por lo tanto ignorando las correlaciones) resulta en una elipse mucho más grande que no refleja la verdadera distribución. El tamaño más grande de esta elipse es resultado de que los términos fuera de la diagonal de la matriz de covarianza se establecieron en cero, y corresponde a que el agente calculó erróneamente la incertidumbre en la probabilidad de que se cumpla cada dimensión del contrato. Esto, a su vez, hace que se calcule de forma incorrecta la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada de un contrato (mostrada en la figura 1 como Var(E[U]). 5. COMUNICANDO REPUTACIÓN Habiendo descrito cómo un agente individual puede utilizar su propia experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para estimar la probabilidad. Nota que las gráficas no son suaves debido al hecho de que, dado un número limitado de resultados de contratos, la media de Va y Vb no varía suavemente con ρ. 1074 The Sixth Intl. Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), ahora pasamos a considerar cómo los agentes dentro de un sistema multiagente abierto pueden comunicar estas estimaciones entre sí. Esto se conoce comúnmente como reputación y permite a los agentes con experiencia directa limitada de un proveedor tomar decisiones racionales. Tanto Jøsang e Ismail, como Teacy y colaboradores, presentan modelos en los que la reputación se comunica entre agentes utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta [6, 11]. Este enfoque es atractivo ya que estas estadísticas suficientes son simples agregaciones de los resultados de los contratos (más precisamente, simplemente son el número total de contratos observados, N, y el número de estos que se cumplieron exitosamente, n). Bajo el marco probabilístico de la distribución beta, los informes de reputación en esta forma simplemente pueden ser agregados con la propia experiencia directa de un agente, con el fin de obtener una estimación más precisa basada en un conjunto más amplio de resultados de contratos. Podemos extender inmediatamente este enfoque al caso multidimensional considerado aquí, al requerir que los agentes intercambien las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet en lugar de la distribución beta. En este caso, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, a y b), los agentes deben comunicar un vector de resultados de contrato, N, que son las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet, dadas por: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Por lo tanto, un agente puede comunicar las estadísticas suficientes de su propia distribución de Dirichlet en términos de solo 2d(d − 1) números (donde d es el número de dimensiones de contrato). Por ejemplo, en el caso de tres dimensiones, N, se da por: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > y, por lo tanto, conjuntos grandes de resultados de contratos pueden ser comunicados dentro de un tamaño de mensaje relativamente pequeño, sin pérdida de información. Una vez más, los agentes que reciben estas estadísticas suficientes pueden simplemente agregarlas a su propia experiencia directa para obtener una estimación más precisa de la confiabilidad de un proveedor. Finalmente, cabe destacar que si bien no es el enfoque de nuestro trabajo aquí, al adoptar el mismo enfoque basado en principios que Jøsang e Ismail, y Teacy y otros, muchas de las técnicas que han desarrollado (como descontar informes de agentes no confiables y filtrar informes inconsistentes de agentes egoístas) pueden aplicarse directamente dentro de este modelo multidimensional. Sin embargo, ahora pasamos a considerar un nuevo problema que surge tanto en los modelos unidimensionales como multidimensionales, a saber, los problemas que surgen cuando dichas estadísticas suficientes agregadas se propagan dentro de redes de agentes descentralizados. 6. PROPAGACIÓN DE RUMORES DENTRO DE SISTEMAS DE REPUTACIÓN En la sección anterior, describimos el uso de estadísticas suficientes para comunicar la reputación, y demostramos que al agregar los resultados de los contratos en estas estadísticas suficientes, se puede representar y comunicar un gran número de resultados de contratos de forma compacta. Si bien esta es una propiedad atractiva, puede ser problemática en la práctica, ya que la procedencia individual de cada resultado de contrato se pierde en la agregación. Por lo tanto, para garantizar una estimación precisa, el sistema de reputación debe asegurarse de que cada observación de un resultado de contrato se incluya en las estadísticas agregadas no más de una vez. Dentro de un sistema de reputación centralizado, donde todos los agentes informan sus experiencias directas a un centro de confianza, es fácil evitar el doble conteo de resultados de contratos. Sin embargo, en un sistema de reputación descentralizado, donde los agentes comunican la reputación entre sí y agregan su experiencia directa con estos informes de reputación sobre la marcha, evitar el doble conteo es mucho más difícil. Por ejemplo, considera el caso mostrado en la figura 3 donde tres agentes (a1 . . . a3), cada uno con cierta experiencia directa de un proveedor, comparten informes de reputación sobre este proveedor. Si el agente a1 proporcionara su estimación a los agentes a2 y a3 en forma de las estadísticas suficientes de su distribución de Dirichlet, entonces estos agentes pueden agregar estos resultados contractuales con los suyos propios, y así obtener estimaciones más precisas. Si en una etapa posterior, el agente a2 enviara su vector agregado de resultados de contratos al agente a3, entonces el agente a3, al no estar al tanto de toda la historia de intercambios, podría intentar combinar estos resultados de contratos con su propio vector agregado. Sin embargo, dado que ambos vectores contienen una contribución del agente a1, estos serán contados dos veces en el vector agregado final, lo que resultará en una estimación sesgada y excesivamente confiada. Esto se denomina propagación de rumores o incesto de datos en la literatura de fusión de datos [9]. Una posible solución sería identificar de manera única la fuente de cada resultado de contrato, y luego propagar cada vector, junto con su etiqueta, a través de la red. Los agentes pueden identificar así observaciones idénticas que han llegado por diferentes rutas, y después de eliminar los duplicados, pueden agregarlos juntos para formar sus estimaciones. Si bien esto parece atractivo en principio, por varias razones, no siempre es una solución viable en la práctica [12]. En primer lugar, los agentes pueden no desear que sus resultados de contrato etiquetados de manera única se compartan en un sistema abierto, ya que dicha información puede tener importancia comercial o práctica que podría ser utilizada en su contra. Por lo tanto, es posible que los agentes solo estén dispuestos a intercambiar resultados de contratos identificables con un pequeño número de otros agentes (quizás aquellos con los que tengan algún tipo de relación recíproca). En segundo lugar, el hecho de que no haya una agregación de los resultados del contrato a medida que circulan por la red significa que el tamaño del mensaje aumenta con el tiempo, y el tamaño final de estos mensajes está limitado únicamente por el número de agentes dentro del sistema (posiblemente un número extremadamente grande para un sistema global). Finalmente, puede resultar realmente difícil asignar etiquetas globalmente aceptables, consistentes y únicas para cada agente dentro de un sistema abierto. En la siguiente sección, desarrollamos una solución novedosa al problema de la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Nuestra solución se basa en un enfoque desarrollado dentro del área de seguimiento de objetivos y fusión de datos [9]. Evita la necesidad de identificar de forma única a un agente, permite a los agentes restringir la cantidad de otros agentes a los que revelan sus estimaciones privadas, y aún así permite que la información se propague por toda la red. 6.1 Información Privada y Compartida Nuestra solución para la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados introduce la noción de información privada que un agente sabe que no ha comunicado a ningún otro agente, y de información compartida que ha sido comunicada a, o recibida de, otro agente. Por lo tanto, el agente puede descomponer su vector de resultado de contrato, N, en dos vectores, uno privado, Np, que no ha sido comunicado a otro agente, y uno compartido, Ns, que ha sido compartido con, o recibido de, otro agente: N = Np + Ns (19). Ahora, cada vez que un agente comunica la reputación, comunica ambos vectores privados y compartidos por separado. Ambos el origEl Sexto Intl. En la Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07), los agentes emisores y receptores actualizan sus dos vectores de manera apropiada. Para entender esto, considera el caso en el que el agente aα envía sus vectores de resultados de contrato privados y compartidos, Nα p y Nα s, al agente aβ que a su vez tiene resultados de contrato privados y compartidos Nβ p y Nβ s. Cada agente actualiza sus vectores de resultados de contrato de acuerdo con el siguiente procedimiento: • Agente de origen: Una vez que el agente de origen ha enviado tanto sus vectores de resultados de contrato compartidos como privados a otro agente, su información privada ya no es privada. Por lo tanto, debe eliminar los resultados de contrato que estaban en su vector privado y agregarlos a su vector compartido: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Agente Receptor: El objetivo del agente receptor es acumular el mayor número de resultados de contrato (ya que esto resultará en la estimación más precisa) sin incluir información compartida tanto de sí mismo como del otro agente (ya que esto podría resultar en la duplicación de resultados de contrato). Tiene dos opciones dependiendo del número total de resultados de contrato dentro de su propio vector compartido, Nβ s , y dentro del del agente de origen, Nα s. Así, actualiza su vector de acuerdo con el procedimiento siguiente: - Nβ s > Nα s: Si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un mayor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente combina su vector compartido con el vector privado del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. - Nβ s < Nα s: Alternativamente, si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un menor número de resultados de contrato que el vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente receptor descarta su propio vector compartido y forma uno nuevo a partir de los vectores privado y compartido del agente de origen: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p sin cambios. En caso de que Nβ s = Nα s, entonces cualquiera de las opciones es apropiada. Una vez que el agente receptor ha actualizado sus conjuntos, utiliza los resultados del contrato en ambos para formar su estimación de confianza. Si los agentes reciben varios vectores simultáneamente, este enfoque se generaliza al agente receptor utilizando el vector compartido más grande, y los vectores privados de sí mismo y de todos los agentes originales para formar su nuevo vector compartido. Este procedimiento tiene varias propiedades atractivas. En primer lugar, dado que los resultados de los contratos en un vector compartido de agentes nunca se combinan con los de otro agente en el vector compartido, los resultados que provienen del mismo agente nunca se combinan entre sí, y por lo tanto, la propagación de rumores se evita por completo. Sin embargo, dado que el agente receptor puede descartar su propio vector compartido y adoptar el vector compartido del agente de origen, la información sigue propagándose por la red. Además, dado que los resultados de los contratos se agregan juntos dentro de los vectores privados y compartidos, el tamaño del mensaje es constante y no aumenta a medida que aumenta el número de interacciones. Finalmente, un agente solo comunica los resultados de su propio contrato privado a sus vecinos inmediatos. Si este agente 6 lo transmite posteriormente, lo hace como información agregada no identificable dentro de su información compartida. Por lo tanto, un agente puede limitar el número de agentes con los que está dispuesto a revelar resultados de contratos identificables, y sin embargo, estos resultados de contratos aún pueden propagarse dentro de la red, y así mejorar las estimaciones de otros agentes. A continuación, demostramos empíricamente que estas propiedades pueden ser realizadas en la práctica. 6.2 Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de este procedimiento, simulamos redes aleatorias compuestas por diez agentes. Cada agente tiene cierta experiencia directa de interactuar con un proveedor (como se describe en la sección 4.3). En cada iteración de la simulación, interactúa con sus vecinos inmediatos y intercambia informes de reputación a través de las estadísticas suficientes de sus distribuciones de Dirichlet. Comparamos nuestra solución con dos de las alternativas descentralizadas más obvias: • Información Privada y Compartida: Los agentes siguen el procedimiento descrito en la sección anterior. Es decir, mantienen vectores separados privados y compartidos de resultados de contrato, y en cada iteración comunican ambos vectores a sus vecinos inmediatos. • Propagación de rumores: Los agentes no diferencian entre resultados de contrato privados y compartidos. En la primera iteración comunican todos los resultados del contrato que constituyen su experiencia directa. En iteraciones posteriores, propagan los resultados de los contratos que reciben de cualquiera de los vecinos a todos sus otros vecinos inmediatos. • Solo Información Privada: Los agentes solo comunican los resultados de los contratos que constituyen su experiencia directa. En todos los casos, en cada iteración, los agentes utilizan la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular sus estimaciones de confianza. Comparamos estos tres enfoques descentralizados con un sistema de reputación centralizado: • Reputación Centralizada: Todos los agentes transmiten su experiencia directa a un sistema de reputación centralizado que las agrega y devuelve esta estimación a cada agente. Esta solución centralizada hace el uso más efectivo de la información disponible en la red. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los problemas del mundo real requieren soluciones descentralizadas debido a preocupaciones de escalabilidad, modularidad y comunicación. Por lo tanto, esta solución centralizada se incluye ya que representa el caso óptimo, y nos permite comparar nuestra solución descentralizada. Los resultados de estas comparaciones se muestran en la figura 4. Aquí mostramos la suma del contenido de información de la matriz de covarianza de cada agente (calculada como se discutió anteriormente en la sección 4.3), para cada uno de estos cuatro enfoques diferentes. Primero observamos que cuando solo se comunica información privada, no hay cambio en la información después de la primera iteración. Una vez que cada agente ha recibido la experiencia directa de sus vecinos inmediatos, no se puede lograr un aumento adicional en la información. Esto representa la comunicación mínima y exhibe la menor cantidad total de información de los cuatro casos. A continuación, observamos que en el caso de la propagación de rumores, el contenido de la información aumenta continuamente y supera rápidamente el resultado de la reputación centralizada. El hecho de que el caso de propagación de rumores exceda incorrectamente este límite indica que está contando continuamente los mismos resultados de contrato a medida que circulan por la red, creyendo que son eventos independientes. Finalmente, observamos que el uso de información privada y compartida representa un compromiso entre el caso de solo información privada y el caso de reputación centralizada. La información todavía se permite propagar por la red, sin embargo los rumores son eliminados. Como antes, también representamos una única instancia de las estimaciones de confianza de un agente (es decir, ˆp(X) y Cov(p(X))) como un conjunto de elipses en un 1076 The Sixth Intl.

Como era de esperar, el sistema de reputación centralizado logra la mejor estimación de la distribución real, ya que utiliza la experiencia directa de todos los agentes. El caso de información privada muestra la elipse más grande ya que propaga la menor cantidad de información alrededor de la red. El caso de propagación de rumores muestra la elipse más pequeña, pero es inconsistente con la distribución real p(X). Por lo tanto, propagar rumores en la red y contar dos veces los resultados de los contratos creyendo que son eventos independientes, resulta en una estimación excesivamente confiada. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución, utilizando vectores separados de información privada y compartida, nos permite propagar más información que en el caso de solo información privada, pero evitamos por completo los problemas de propagación de rumores. Finalmente, consideramos el efecto que esto tiene en el cálculo del valor esperado de utilidad del contrato por parte de los agentes. Suponemos la misma función de utilidad que se utilizó en la sección 4.3 (es decir, u(oa = 1) = 6 y u(ob = 1) = 2), y en la tabla 1 presentamos la estimación de la utilidad esperada y su desviación estándar calculada para los cuatro casos por un único agente en la quinta iteración (después de que la comunicación haya dejado de tener efecto adicional para todos los métodos excepto la propagación de rumores). Observamos que el caso de propagación de rumores es claramente inconsistente con el sistema de reputación centralizado, ya que su desviación estándar es demasiado pequeña y no refleja la verdadera incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada, dadas las consecuencias del contrato. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución representa el caso más cercano al sistema de reputación centralizado, y por lo tanto logra propagar la información a lo largo de la red, evitando al mismo tiempo el sesgo y la <br>sobreconfianza</br>. La diferencia exacta entre esto y el sistema de reputación centralizado depende de la topología de la red y de la historia de intercambios que tienen lugar dentro de ella. 7. CONCLUSIONES En este artículo abordamos la necesidad de un modelo probabilístico fundamentado de confianza computacional que maneje contratos con múltiples dimensiones correlacionadas. Nuestro punto de partida fue un agente que estimaba la utilidad esperada de un contrato, y demostramos que esto conduce a un modelo de confianza computacional que utiliza la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular una estimación de confianza a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente. Luego mostramos cómo los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para representar y comunicar la reputación dentro de un sistema de reputación descentralizado, y presentamos una solución a la propagación de rumores dentro de estos sistemas. Nuestro trabajo futuro en esta área es extender el intercambio de reputación al caso en el que los contratos no son homogéneos. Es decir, no todos los agentes observan las mismas dimensiones del contrato. Esta es una extensión desafiante, ya que en este caso, las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet no pueden ser utilizadas directamente.

                "INTRODUCTION The role of computational models of trust within multi-agent systems in particular, and open distributed systems in general, has recently generated a great deal of research interest.",
                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
                "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
                "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",
                "To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",
                "The starting point for our work is to consider how an agent can estimate the utility that it will derive from interacting with a supplier.",
                "Here we use standard approaches from the literature of data fusion (since this is a well developed field where the notion of multi-dimensional correlated estimates is well established1 ) to show that this naturally leads to a trust model where the agent must estimate probabilities and correlations over 1 In this context, the multiple dimensions typically represent the physical coordinates of a target being tracked, and correlations arise through the operation and orientation of sensors. 1070 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS multiple dimensions.",

                "We devise a novel multi-dimensional probabilistic trust model that enables an agent to estimate the expected utility of a contract, by estimating (i) the probability that each contract dimension will be successfully fulfilled, and (ii) the correlations between these estimates. 2.",
                "We present an exact probabilistic model based upon the Dirichlet distribution that allows agents to use their direct experience of contract outcomes to calculate the probabilities and correlations described above.",
                "We then benchmark this solution and show that it leads to good estimates. 3.",
                "We show that agents can use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution in order to exchange reputation reports with one another.",
                "The sufficient statistics represent aggregations of their direct experience, and thus, express contract outcomes in a compact format with no loss of information. 4.",
                "We show that, while being efficient, the aggregation of contract outcomes can lead to double counting, and rumour propagation, in decentralised reputation systems.",

                "We show that it yields estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding overconfidence.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: in section 2 we review related work.",

                "Sabater and Sierra present a model of reputation, in which agents form contracts based on multiple variables (such as delivery date and quality), and define impressions as subjective evaluations of the outcome of these contracts.",
                "They provide heuristic approaches to combining these impressions to form a measure they call subjective reputation.",
                "Likewise, Griffiths decomposes overall trust into a number of different dimensions such as success, cost, timeliness and quality [4].",
                "In his case, each dimension is scored as a real number that represents a comparative value with no strong semantic meaning.",
                "He develops an heuristic rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers.",
                "Whilst, he comments that the trust values could have some associated confidence level, heuristics for updating these levels are not presented.",
                "Gujral et al. take a similar approach and present a trust model over multiple domain specific dimensions [5].",
                "They define multidimensional goal requirements, and evaluate an expected payoff based on a suppliers estimated behaviour.",
                "These estimates are, however, simple aggregations over the direct experience of several agents, and there is no measure of the uncertainty.",
                "Nevertheless, they show that agents who select suppliers based on these multiple dimensions outperform those who consider just a single one.",
                "By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension.",
                "Jøsang and Ismail describe the Beta Reputation System whereby the reputation of an agent is compiled from the positive and negative reports from other agents who have interacted with it [6].",
                "The beta distribution represents a natural choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a principled means of representing uncertainty.",
                "Moreover, they provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques to deal with reputations that may change over time.",
                "Likewise, Teacy et al. use the beta distribution to describe an agents belief in the probability that another agent will successfully fulfill its commitments [11].",
                "They present a formalism using a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other agents.",
                "They provide a number of extensions to this initial model, and, in particular, they consider that agents may not always truthfully report their trust estimates.",
                "Thus, they present a principled approach to detecting and removing inconsistent reports.",
                "Our work builds upon these more principled approaches.",
                "However, the starting point of our approach is to consider an agent that is attempting to estimate the expected utility of a contract.",
                "We show that estimating this expected utility requires that an agent must estimate the probability with which the supplier will fulfill its contract.",
                "In the single-dimensional case, this naturally leads to a trust model using the beta distribution (as per Jøsang and Ismail and Teacy et al.).",
                "However, we then go on to extend this analysis to multiple dimensions, where we use the natural extension of the beta distribution, namely the Dirichlet distribution, to represent the agents belief over multiple dimensions. 3.",

                "Now, given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the supplier will fulfill the contract, it should consider the expected utility that it will derive, E[U], and this is given by: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) where p(o = 1) is the probability that the supplier will successfully fulfill the contract.",
                "However, whilst u(o = 1) is known by the agent, p(o = 1) is not.",
                "The best the agent can do is to determine a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct experience of previous contract outcomes.",
                "Given that it has been able to do so, it can then determine an estimate of the expected utility4 of the contract, E[E[U]], and a measure of its uncertainty in this expected utility, Var(E[U]).",
                "This uncertainty is important since a risk averse agent may make a decision regarding a contract, 2 Note that we only consider binary contract outcomes, although extending this to partial outcomes is part of our future work. 3 Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is derived from an unsuccessful outcome. 4 Note that this is often called the expected expected utility, and this is the notation that we adopt here [2].",

                "By adopting the beta distribution, we can calculate ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) using standard results, and thus, if an agent observed N previous contracts of which n were successfully fulfilled, then: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 and: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Note that as expected, the greater the number of contracts the agent observes, the smaller the variance term Var(p(o = 1)), and, thus, the less the uncertainty regarding the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1). 4.",
                "<br>multi-dimensional trust</br> We now extend the description above, to consider contracts between suppliers and agents that are represented by multiple dimensions, and hence the success or failure of a contract can be decomposed into the success or failure of each separate dimension.",

                "Rather, given the agents direct experience of the supplier, the agent can determine a distribution over possible values for p(X).",
                "In the single dimensional case, a beta distribution was the natural choice over possible values of p(o = 1).",
                "In the multi-dimensional case, where p(X) itself is a vector of probabilities, the corresponding natural choice is the Dirichlet distribution, since this is a conjugate prior for multinomial proportions [3].",
                "Given this distribution, the agent is then able to calculate an estimate of the expected utility of a contract.",
                "As before, this estimate is itself represented by an expected value given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) and a variance, describing the uncertainty in this expected utility: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) where: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Thus, whilst the single dimensional case naturally leads to a trust model in which the agents attempt to derive an estimate of probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1), along with a scalar variance that describes the uncertainty in this probability, Var(p(o = 1)), in this case, the agents must derive an estimate of a vector of probabilities, ˆp(X), along with a covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), that represents the uncertainty in p(X) given the observed contractual outcomes.",
                "At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract.",
                "However, in the multi-dimensional case the agent must determine ˆp(X), and since this describes the probability of all possible contract outcomes, including those that are completely un-fulfilled, this direct semantic interpretation is not present.",

                "In the remainder of this paper, for illustrative purposes, we shall limit the discussion to the simplest possible utility function that exhibits a dependence upon the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
                "That is, we consider the case that expected utility is dependent only on the marginal probabilities of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, rather than the full joint probabilities: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Thus, ˆp(X) is a vector estimate of the probability of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, and maintains the clear semantic interpretation seen in the single dimensional case: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) The correlations between the contract dimensions affect the uncertainty in the expected utility.",

                "We first illustrate why this is necessary by considering an alternative approach to modelling multi-dimensional contracts whereby an agent na¨ıvely assumes that the dimensions are independent, and thus, it models each individually by separate beta distributions (as in the single dimensional case we presented in section 3).",
                "This is actually equivalent to setting the off-diagonal terms within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), to zero.",
                "However, doing so can lead an agent to assume that its estimate of the expected utility of the contract is more accurate than it actually is.",
                "To illustrate this, consider a specific scenario with the following values: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 and Va = Vb = 0.2.",

                "Thus, in order to have an accurate estimate of the variance of the expected contract utility, and to make a rational decision, it is essential that the agent is able to represent and calculate these correlation terms.",
                "In the next section, we describe how an agent may do so using the Dirichlet distribution. 4.2 The Dirichlet Distribution In this section, we describe how the agent may use its direct experience of previous contracts, and the standard results of the Dirichlet distribution, to determine an estimate of the probability that each contract dimension will be successful fulfilled, ˆp(X), and a measure of the uncertainties in these probabilities that expresses the correlations between the contract dimensions, Cov(p(X)).",
                "We first consider the calculation of ˆp(X) and the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)).",
                "As described above, the derivation of these results is identical to the case of the single dimensional beta distribution, where out of N contract outcomes, n are successfully fulfilled.",
                "In the multi-dimensional case, however, we have a vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} that represents the number of outcomes for which each of the individual contract dimensions were successfully fulfilled.",
                "Thus, in terms of the standard Dirichlet parameters where αa = na + 1 and α0 = N + 2, the agent can estimate the probability of this contract dimension being successfully fulfilled: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 and can also calculate the variance in any contract dimension: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) However, calculating the off-diagonal terms within Cov(p(X)) is more complex since it is necessary to consider the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
                "Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j.",
                "For example, nab 10 represents the number of contracts for which oa = 1 and ob = 0.",
                "Now, using the standard Dirichlet notation, we can define αab ij nab ij + 1 for all i and j taking values 0 and 1, and then, to calculate the cross-correlations between contract pairs a and b, we note that the Dirichlet distribution over pair-wise joint probabilities is: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 where: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 and Kab is a normalising constant [3].",

                "Under the probabilistic framework of the beta distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agents own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.",
                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",
                "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",

                "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
                "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",

                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
                "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",

Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas I.2.11 [Inteligencia Artificial Distribuida]: Agentes inteligentes Términos Generales Algoritmos, Diseño, Teoría 1. INTRODUCCIÓN El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas multiagente en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente un gran interés en la investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes suelen tener que elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto la confianza puede considerarse como un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la fiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo en esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas del dominio o ad hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando la experiencia directa e informes de reputación de otros agentes (ver [8] para una revisión). Trabajos recientes han intentado situar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite abordar muchos de los deseos de los modelos de confianza computacional a través de medios fundamentados. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones sobre la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre sobre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentes intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, está algo limitado en el sentido de que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados unidimensionales (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o fracaso de una interacción puede descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una métrica única sobre la cual se pueda tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también mostrarán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que está experimentando retrasos puede intentar un intercambio entre estas dimensiones suministrando la cantidad completa tarde, o suministrando tanto como sea posible (pero menos que la cantidad especificada en el contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, surgirán naturalmente correlaciones entre estas dimensiones, y por ende, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe un marco principista para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la sección 2 para más detalles). Para corregir esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que obtendrá al interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida) para mostrar que esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar probabilidades y correlaciones sobre múltiples dimensiones. En este contexto, las múltiples dimensiones representan típicamente las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que está siendo rastreado, y las correlaciones surgen a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores. Sobre esta base, luego diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborda los tres deseos discutidos anteriormente. En detalle, en este artículo ampliamos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un novedoso modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, al estimar (i) la probabilidad de que se cumpla con éxito cada dimensión del contrato, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados de los contratos para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y demostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones. 3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden utilizar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre ellos. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa, y por lo tanto, expresan resultados de contratos en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información. 4. Mostramos que, aunque sea eficiente, la agregación de resultados de contratos puede llevar a la doble contabilización y a la propagación de rumores en sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, manteniendo al mismo tiempo el anonimato de los agentes y evitando la sobreconfianza. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera: en la sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato unidimensional, antes de introducir nuestro <br>modelo de confianza multidimensional</br> en la sección 4. En las secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la comunicación de la reputación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en sistemas descentralizados de reputación. Concluimos en la sección 7.2. TRABAJO RELACIONADO Varios investigadores han reconocido la necesidad de un <br>modelo de confianza multidimensional</br>. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el cual los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones y formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Asimismo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en una serie de dimensiones diferentes como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se puntúa como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Él desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basada en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un único escalar que luego se utiliza para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al. adoptan un enfoque similar y presentan un modelo de confianza sobre múltiples dimensiones específicas del dominio [5]. Ellos definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una ganancia esperada basada en el comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Estas estimaciones son, sin embargo, simples agregaciones de la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay una medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, demuestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basándose en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que solo consideran una sola. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacional más fundamentados basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitados a una sola dimensión. Jøsang e Ismail describen el Sistema de Reputación Beta, en el cual la reputación de un agente se compila a partir de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6]. La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio fundamentado para representar la incertidumbre. Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluyen un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descontar las opiniones de agentes que tienen calificaciones de reputación bajas, y técnicas para manejar reputaciones que pueden cambiar con el tiempo. Asimismo, Teacy et al. utilizan la distribución beta para describir la creencia de un agente en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla exitosamente con sus compromisos [11]. Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad basándose en su experiencia directa, y nuevamente utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes. Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial, y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan con veracidad sus estimaciones de confianza. Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque basado en principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes. Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más fundamentados. Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato. En el caso unidimensional, esto conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.). Sin embargo, luego pasamos a extender este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, es decir, la distribución de Dirichlet, para representar la creencia de los agentes sobre múltiples dimensiones. 3. CONFIANZA UNIDIMENSIONAL Antes de presentar nuestro modelo de <br>confianza multidimensional</br>, primero introducimos la notación y el formalismo que utilizaremos describiendo el caso más familiar unidimensional. Consideramos a un agente que debe decidir si comprometerse en un contrato futuro con un proveedor. Este contrato llevará a algún resultado, o, y consideramos que o = 1 si el contrato se cumple con éxito, y o = 0 si no. Para que el agente pueda tomar una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Suponemos que en caso de que el contrato se cumpla con éxito, el agente obtiene una utilidad u(o = 1), de lo contrario no recibe ninguna utilidad. Ahora, dado que el agente no está seguro de la fiabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá el contrato, debería considerar la utilidad esperada que obtendrá, E[U], y esto se da por: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) donde p(o = 1) es la probabilidad de que el proveedor cumpla exitosamente con el contrato. Sin embargo, aunque el agente conoce u(o = 1), no conoce p(o = 1). Lo mejor que el agente puede hacer es determinar una distribución sobre los posibles valores de p(o = 1) dados sus experiencias directas de resultados de contratos anteriores. Dado que ha sido capaz de hacerlo, puede entonces determinar una estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, E[E[U]], y una medida de su incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada, Var(E[U]). Esta incertidumbre es importante ya que un agente adverso al riesgo puede tomar una decisión con respecto a un contrato. Nota que solo consideramos resultados de contratos binarios, aunque extender esto a resultados parciales es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro. Claramente esto puede extenderse al caso en el que se derive cierta utilidad de un resultado no exitoso. Nota que esto a menudo se llama la utilidad esperada esperada, y esta es la notación que adoptamos aquí. El Sexto Internacional. La Conferencia Conjunta sobre Agentes Autónomos y Sistemas Multiagente (AAMAS 07) no solo se basa en su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, sino también en la probabilidad de que la utilidad esperada supere cierta cantidad mínima. Estas dos propiedades se dan por: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) donde ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) son la estimación y la incertidumbre de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, y se calculan a partir de la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) que el agente determina a partir de su experiencia directa. El enfoque basado en utilidad que presentamos aquí proporciona una motivación atractiva para este modelo de Teacy et al. [11]. Ahora, en el caso de resultados de contratos binarios, la distribución beta es la elección natural para representar la distribución de los posibles valores de p(o = 1) ya que dentro de la estadística bayesiana se sabe que es la distribución previa conjugada para observaciones binomiales [3]. Al adoptar la distribución beta, podemos calcular ˆp(o = 1) y Var(p(o = 1)) utilizando resultados estándar, y así, si un agente observó N contratos anteriores de los cuales n se cumplieron con éxito, entonces: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 y: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Tenga en cuenta que, como era de esperar, cuanto mayor sea el número de contratos que el agente observa, menor será el término de varianza Var(p(o = 1)), y, por lo tanto, menor será la incertidumbre con respecto a la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp(o = 1). CONFIANZA MULTI-DIMENSIONAL Ahora extendemos la descripción anterior para considerar contratos entre proveedores y agentes que están representados por múltiples dimensiones, por lo que el éxito o fracaso de un contrato puede descomponerse en el éxito o fracaso de cada dimensión por separado.

                "Agents can thus identify identical observations that have arrived through different routes, and after removing the duplicates, can aggregate these together to form their estimates.",
                "Whilst this appears to be attractive in principle, for a number of reasons, it is not always a viable solution in practise [12].",
                "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
                "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",
                "Finally, it may actually be difficult to assign globally agreeable, consistent, and unique labels for each agent within an open system.",
                "In the next section, we develop a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems.",
                "Our solution is based on an approach developed within the area of target tracking and data fusion [9].",
                "It avoids the need to uniquely identify an agent, it allows agents to restrict the number of other agents who they reveal their private estimates to, and yet it still allows information to propagate throughout the network. 6.1 Private and Shared Information Our solution to rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems introduces the notion of private information that an agent knows it has not communicated to any other agent, and shared information that has been communicated to, or received from, another agent.",
                "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

                "To understand this, consider the case that agent aα sends its private and shared contract outcome vectors, Nα p and Nα s , to agent aβ that itself has private and shared contract outcomes Nβ p and Nβ s .",
                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
                "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
                "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",
                "Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3).",
                "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
                "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
                "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
                "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",
                "This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network.",
                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
                "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",
                "The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4.",
                "Here we show the sum of the information content of each agents covariance matrix (calculated as discussed earlier in section 4.3), for each of these four different approaches.",
                "We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration.",
                "Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved.",
                "This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases.",
                "Next, we note that in the case of rumour propagation, the information content increases continually, and rapidly exceeds the centralised reputation result.",
                "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",
                "Finally, we note that using private and shared information represents a compromise between the private information only case and the centralised reputation case.",
                "Information is still allowed to propagate around the network, however rumours are eliminated.",

                "The rumour propagation case shows the smallest ellipse, but it is inconsistent with the actual distribution p(X).",
                "Thus, propagating rumours around the network and double counting contract outcomes in the belief that they are independent events, results in an overconfident estimate.",
                "However, we note that our solution, using separate vectors of private and shared information, allows us to propagate more information than the private information only case, but we completely avoid the problems of rumour propagation.",
                "Finally, we consider the effect that this has on the agents calculation of the expected utility of the contract.",
                "We assume the same utility function as used in section 4.3 (i.e. u(oa = 1) = 6 and u(ob = 1) = 2), and in table 1 we present the estimate of the expected utility, and its standard deviation calculated for all four cases by a single agent at iteration five (after communication has ceased to have any further effect for all methods other than rumour propagation).",
                "We note that the rumour propagation case is clearly inconsistent with the centralised reputation system, since its standard deviation is too small and does not reflect the true uncertainty in the expected utility, given the contract outcomes.",
                "However, we observe that our solution represents the closest case to the centralised reputation system, and thus succeeds in propagating information throughout the network, whilst also avoiding bias and overconfidence.",

                "Our starting point was an agent estimating the expected utility of a contract, and we showed that this leads to a model of computational trust that uses the Dirichlet distribution to calculate a trust estimate from the direct experience of an agent.",
                "We then showed how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to represent and communicate reputation within a decentralised reputation system, and we presented a solution to rumour propagation within these systems.",
