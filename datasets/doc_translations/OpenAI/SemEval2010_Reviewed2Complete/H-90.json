In this paper, we study how to exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve retrieval accuracy in an interactive information retrieval setting. We propose several contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents. We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set. Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially. Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1. INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents. From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need. An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available. Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2]. There are many kinds of context that we can exploit. Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy. However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents. Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information. Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications. For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8]. For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied. In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading). We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results. A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort. For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia. As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island. However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents. Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information. For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for. Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works. In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people. In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated. In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user. Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6]. While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval. Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy. We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information. We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model. One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation. We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback. We evaluate the proposed models using this data set. The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user. The remaining sections are organized as follows. In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later. In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models. In Section 4, we describe how we create the data set for implicit feedback experiments. In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set. Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2. PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback. One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session. A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need. The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context. Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search. In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session. The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time. Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session. In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context. In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times. During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query. Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session. Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper. In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16]. Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval. But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section. Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy. In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available. For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view. We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history. The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document. Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need. Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval. In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1. We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk. Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17]. Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them. In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3. LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk. An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively. We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method. According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document. One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model. Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk. Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history. Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally. Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC . We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk). We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text. We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ). Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H). Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk). These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information. If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries. But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history. To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator. The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ). We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length. Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α. Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries. This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries. However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better. Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable. Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries. Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way. In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents. In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need. In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query. A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general. Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary). To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior. We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions. With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation. In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment. As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model. Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user. For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past. We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0. After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1. The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1. As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1. As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2. In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model. Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci. In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data. Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary. If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci). On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model. Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence. In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i. For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi. But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents. This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen. To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight. This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document. One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries. The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries. As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value. And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic. Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one. There are two choices. One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine). But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data. The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file. Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data. We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data. We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments. There are altogether 242918 news articles and the average document length is 416 words. Most articles have titles. If not, we select the first sentence of the text as the title. For the preprocessing, we only do case folding and do not do stopword removal or stemming. We select 30 relatively difficult topics from TREC topics 1-150. These 30 topics have the worst average precision performance among TREC topics 1-150 according to some baseline experiments using the KL-Divergence model with Bayesian prior smoothing [20]. The reason why we select difficult topics is that the user then would have to have several interactions with the retrieval system in order to get satisfactory results so that we can expect to collect a relatively richer query history and clickthrough history data from the user. In real applications, we may also expect our models to be most useful for such difficult topics, so our data collection strategy reflects the real world applications well. We index the TREC AP data set and set up a search engine and web interface for TREC AP news articles. We use 3 subjects to do experiments to collect query history and clickthrough history data. Each subject is assigned 10 topics and given the topic descriptions provided by TREC. For each topic, the first query is the title of the topic given in the original TREC topic description. After the subject submits the query, the search engine will do retrieval and return a ranked list of search results to the subject. The subject will browse the results and maybe click one or more results to browse the full text of article(s). The subject may also modify the query to do another search. For each topic, the subject composes at least 4 queries. In our experiment, only the first 4 queries for each topic are used. The user needs to select the topic number from a selection menu before submitting the query to the search engine so that we can easily detect the session boundary, which is not the focus of our study. We use a relational database to store user interactions, including the submitted queries and clicked documents. For each query, we store the query terms and the associated result pages. And for each clicked document, we store the summary as shown on the search result page. The summary of the article is query dependent and is computed online using fixed-length passage retrieval (KL divergence model with Bayesian prior smoothing). Among 120 (4 for each of 30 topics) queries which we study in the experiment, the average query length is 3.71 words. Altogether there are 91 documents clicked to view. So on average, there are around 3 clicks per topic.

EXPERIMENTS 5.1 Experiment design Our major hypothesis is that using search context (i.e., query history and clickthrough information) can help improve search accuracy. In particular, the search context can provide extra information to help us estimate a better query model than using just the current query. So most of our experiments involve comparing the retrieval performance using the current query only (thus ignoring any context) with that using the current query as well as the search context. Since we collected four versions of queries for each topic, we make such comparisons for each version of queries. We use two performance measures: (1) Mean Average Precision (MAP): This is the standard non-interpolated average precision and serves as a good measure of the overall ranking accuracy. (2) Precision at 20 documents (pr@20docs): This measure does not average well, but it is more meaningful than MAP and reflects the utility for users who only read the top 20 documents. In all cases, the reported figure is the average over all of the 30 topics. We evaluate the four models for exploiting search context (i.e., FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp, and BatchUp). Each model has precisely two parameters (α and β for FixInt; µ and ν for others). Note that µ and ν may need to be interpreted differently for different methods. We vary these parameters and identify the optimal performance for each method. We also vary the parameters to study the sensitivity of our algorithms to the setting of the parameters. 5.2 Result analysis 5.2.1 Overall effect of search context We compare the optimal performances of four models with those using the current query only in Table 1. A row labeled with qi is the baseline performance and a row labeled with qi + HQ + HC is the performance of using search context. We can make several observations from this table: 1. Comparing the baseline performances indicates that on average reformulated queries are better than the previous queries with the performance of q4 being the best. Users generally formulate better and better queries. 2. Using search context generally has positive effect, especially when the context is rich. This can be seen from the fact that the 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip improvement for q4 and q3 is generally more substantial compared with q2. Actually, in many cases with q2, using the context may hurt the performance, probably because the history at that point is sparse. When the search context is rich, the performance improvement can be quite substantial. For example, BatchUp achieves 92.4% improvement in the mean average precision over q3 and 77.2% improvement over q4. (The generally low precisions also make the relative improvement deceptively high, though.) 3. Among the four models using search context, the performances of FixInt and OnlineUp are clearly worse than those of BayesInt and BatchUp. Since BayesInt performs better than FixInt and the main difference between BayesInt and FixInt is that the former uses an adaptive coefficient for interpolation, the results suggest that using adaptive coefficient is quite beneficial and a Bayesian style interpolation makes sense. The main difference between OnlineUp and BatchUp is that OnlineUp uses decaying coefficients to combine the multiple clicked summaries, while BatchUp simply concatenates all clicked summaries. Therefore the fact that BatchUp is consistently better than OnlineUp indicates that the weights for combining the clicked summaries indeed should not be decaying. While OnlineUp is theoretically appealing, its performance is inferior to BayesInt and BatchUp, likely because of the decaying coefficient. Overall, BatchUp appears to be the best method when we vary the parameter settings. We have two different kinds of search context - query history and clickthrough data. We now look into the contribution of each kind of context. 5.2.2 Using query history only In each of four models, we can turn off the clickthrough history data by setting parameters appropriately. This allows us to evaluate the effect of using query history alone. We use the same parameter setting for query history as in Table 1. The results are shown in Table 2. Here we see that in general, the benefit of using query history is very limited with mixed results. This is different from what is reported in a previous study [15], where using query history is consistently helpful. Another observation is that the context runs perform poorly at q2, but generally perform (slightly) better than the baselines for q3 and q4. This is again likely because at the beginning the initial query, which is the title in the original TREC topic description, may not be a good query; indeed, on average, performances of these first-generation queries are clearly poorer than those of all other user-formulated queries in the later generations. Yet another observation is that when using query history only, the BayesInt model appears to be better than other models.

The displayed results thus reflect the variation caused by parameter µ. A smaller setting of 2.0 is seen better than a larger value of 5.0. A more complete picture of the influence of the setting of µ can be seen from Table 3, where we show the performance figures for a wider range of values of µ. The value of µ can be interpreted as how many words we regard the query history is worth. A larger value thus puts more weight on the history and is seen to hurt the performance more when the history information is not rich. Thus while for q4 the best performance tends to be achieved for µ ∈ [2, 5], only when µ = 0.5 we see some small benefit for q2. As we would expect, an excessively large µ would hurt the performance in general, but q2 is hurt most and q4 is barely hurt, indicating that as we accumulate more and more query history information, we can put more and more weight on the history information. This also suggests that a better strategy should probably dynamically adjust parameters according to how much history information we have. The mixed query history results suggest that the positive effect of using implicit feedback information may have largely come from the use of clickthrough history, which is indeed true as we discuss in the next subsection. 5.2.3 Using clickthrough history only We now turn off the query history and only use the clicked summaries plus the current query. The results are shown in Table 4. We see that the benefit of using clickthrough information is much more significant than that of using query history. We see an overall positive effect, often with significant improvement over the baseline. It is also clear that the richer the context data is, the more improvement using clicked summaries can achieve. Other than some occasional degradation of precision at 20 documents, the improvement is fairly consistent and often quite substantial. These results show that the clicked summary text is in general quite useful for inferring a users information need. Intuitively, using the summary text, rather than the actual content of the document, makes more sense, as it is quite possible that the document behind a seemingly relevant summary is actually non-relevant. 29 out of the 91 clicked documents are relevant. Updating the query model based on such summaries would bring up the ranks of these relevant documents, causing performance improvement. However, such improvement is really not beneficial for the user as the user has already seen these relevant documents. To see how much improvement we have achieved on improving the ranks of the unseen relevant documents, we exclude these 29 relevant documents from our judgment file and recompute the performance of BayesInt and the baseline using the new judgment file. The results are shown in Table 5. Note that the performance of the baseline method is lower due to the removal of the 29 relevant documents, which would have been generally ranked high in the results. From Table 5, we see clearly that using clicked summaries also helps improve the ranks of unseen relevant documents significantly.

To answer this question, we took out the 29 relevant summaries from our clickthrough history data HC to obtain a smaller set of clicked summaries HC , and re-evaluated the performance of the BayesInt method using HC with the same setting of parameters as in Table 4. The results are shown in Table 6. We see that although the improvement is not as substantial as in Table 4, the average precision is improved across all generations of queries. These results should be interpreted as very encouraging as they are based on only 62 non-relevant clickthroughs. In reality, a user would more likely click some relevant summaries, which would help bring up more relevant documents as we have seen in Table 4 and Table 5.

In Table 7, we show this effect for the BatchUp method. 5.2.5 Parameter sensitivity All four models have two parameters to control the relative weights of HQ, HC , and Qk, though the parameterization is different from model to model. In this subsection, we study the parameter sensitivity for BatchUp, which appears to perform relatively better than others. BatchUp has two parameters µ and ν. We first look at µ. When µ is set to 0, the query history is not used at all, and we essentially just use the clickthrough data combined with the current query. If we increase µ, we will gradually incorporate more information from the previous queries. In Table 8, we show how the average precision of BatchUp changes as we vary µ with ν fixed to 15.0, where the best performance of BatchUp is achieved. We see that the performance is mostly insensitive to the change of µ for q3 and q4, but is decreasing as µ increases for q2. The pattern is also similar when we set ν to other values. In addition to the fact that q1 is generally worse than q2, q3, and q4, another possible reason why the sensitivity is lower for q3 and q4 may be that we generally have more clickthrough data available for q3 and q4 than for q2, and the dominating influence of the clickthrough data has made the small differences caused by µ less visible for q3 and q4. The best performance is generally achieved when µ is around 2.0, which means that the past query information is as useful as about 2 words in the current query. Except for q2, there is clearly some tradeoff between the current query and the previous queries Query MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Improve. -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Improve. 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Improve. 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Improve 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Improve 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Improve 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Improve 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Improve 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Improve 77.2% 16.4% Table 7: Additive benefit of context information and using a balanced combination of them achieves better performance than using each of them alone. We now turn to the other parameter ν. When ν is set to 0, we only use the clickthrough data; When ν is set to +∞, we only use the query history and the current query. With µ set to 2.0, where the best performance of BatchUp is achieved, we vary ν and show the results in Table 9. We see that the performance is also not very sensitive when ν ≤ 30, with the best performance often achieved at ν = 15. This means that the combined information of query history and the current query is as useful as about 15 words in the clickthrough data, indicating that the clickthrough information is highly valuable. Overall, these sensitivity results show that BatchUp not only performs better than other methods, but also is quite robust. 6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we have explored how to exploit implicit feedback information, including query history and clickthrough history within the same search session, to improve information retrieval performance. Using the KL-divergence retrieval model as the basis, we proposed and studied four statistical language models for context-sensitive information retrieval, i.e., FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp and BatchUp.

Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially clickthrough history, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring any additional user effort. The current work can be extended in several ways: First, we have only explored some very simple language models for incorporating implicit feedback information. It would be interesting to develop more sophisticated models to better exploit query history and clickthrough history. For example, we may treat a clicked summary differently depending on whether the current query is a generalization or refinement of the previous query. Second, the proposed models can be implemented in any practical systems. We are currently developing a client-side personalized search agent, which will incorporate some of the proposed algorithms. We will also do a user study to evaluate effectiveness of these models in the real web search. Finally, we should further study a general retrieval framework for sequential decision making in interactive information retrieval and study how to optimize some of the parameters in the context-sensitive retrieval models. 7.

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente haría clic frecuentemente en algunos documentos para verlos. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic. Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación. En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1. También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos. En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos. Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación. Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta. Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk. Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics. Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk). Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto. Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una interpolación de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial. Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ). Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta. Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperación interactivo, la presentamos de una manera más general. En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva). Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimación bayesiana, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la estimación bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior. Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales. Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un proceso interactivo de recuperación utilizando estimación bayesiana. En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0. Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1. Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados. Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado. Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci). Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual. En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto. Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados. En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos. La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia. Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos de TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de texto, porque los datos de AP han sido utilizados en varias tareas de TREC y cuentan con juicios relativamente completos. Hay en total 242918 artículos de noticias y la longitud promedio de los documentos es de 416 palabras. La mayoría de los artículos tienen títulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oración del texto como título. Para el preprocesamiento, solo realizamos la conversión a minúsculas y no eliminamos stopwords ni realizamos stemming. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difíciles de los temas TREC 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisión entre los temas 1-150 de TREC según algunos experimentos de referencia utilizando el modelo de Divergencia de KL con suavizado de priorización bayesiana [20]. La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexamos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de búsqueda e interfaz web para los artículos de noticias de TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para realizar experimentos y recopilar datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asignan 10 temas y se le proporcionan las descripciones de los temas proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el título del tema dado en la descripción original del tema de TREC. Después de que el sujeto envíe la consulta, el motor de búsqueda realizará la recuperación y devolverá una lista clasificada de resultados de búsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto revisará los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o más resultados para leer el texto completo del artículo o artículos. El sujeto también puede modificar la consulta para realizar otra búsqueda. Para cada tema, el sujeto compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el número del tema de un menú de selección antes de enviar la consulta al motor de búsqueda para que podamos detectar fácilmente el límite de la sesión, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones de los usuarios, incluyendo las consultas enviadas y los documentos clicados. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los términos de la consulta y las páginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento clicado, almacenamos el resumen tal como se muestra en la página de resultados de búsqueda. El resumen del artículo es dependiente de la consulta y se calcula en línea utilizando la recuperación de pasajes de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado de prior bayesiano). De entre 120 consultas (4 para cada uno de los 30 temas) que estudiamos en el experimento, la longitud promedio de las consultas es de 3.71 palabras. En total hay 91 documentos clicados para ver. En promedio, hay alrededor de 3 clics por tema.

EXPERIMENTOS 5.1 Diseño del experimento Nuestra hipótesis principal es que el uso del contexto de búsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas y la información de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. En particular, el contexto de búsqueda puede proporcionar información adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un modelo de consulta mejor que simplemente utilizando la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de recuperación utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando así cualquier contexto) con el rendimiento utilizando tanto la consulta actual como el contexto de búsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, realizamos tales comparaciones para cada versión de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) Precisión Promedio Media (MAP): Esta es la precisión promedio estándar no interpolada y sirve como una buena medida de la precisión general de clasificación. (2) Precisión en 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es más significativa que MAP y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los primeros 20 documentos. En todos los casos, la cifra reportada es el promedio de los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de búsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parámetros (α y β para FixInt; µ y ν para los demás). Ten en cuenta que µ y ν pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes métodos. Variamos estos parámetros e identificamos el rendimiento óptimo para cada método. También variamos los parámetros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuración de los parámetros. 5.2 Análisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de búsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento óptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que utilizan solo la consulta actual en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con qi es el rendimiento base y una fila etiquetada con qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento al utilizar el contexto de búsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones a partir de esta tabla: 1. Comparar las actuaciones de referencia indica que, en promedio, las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores, siendo la actuación de q4 la mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan consultas cada vez mejores. El uso del contexto de búsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede observar en el hecho de que la mejora del 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip para q4 y q3 es generalmente más sustancial en comparación con q2. De hecho, en muchos casos con q2, el uso del contexto puede perjudicar el rendimiento, probablemente porque el historial en ese punto es escaso. Cuando el contexto de búsqueda es amplio, la mejora en el rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, BatchUp logra una mejora del 92.4% en la precisión media promedio sobre q3 y del 77.2% sobre q4. (Las precisiones generalmente bajas también hacen que la mejora relativa sea engañosamente alta, sin embargo). 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que utilizan contexto de búsqueda, las actuaciones de FixInt y OnlineUp son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y BatchUp. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que FixInt y la principal diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que el primero utiliza un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolación, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y que una interpolación de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre OnlineUp y BatchUp es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes decaídos para combinar los múltiples resúmenes clicados, mientras que BatchUp simplemente concatena todos los resúmenes clicados. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que OnlineUp indica que los pesos para combinar los resúmenes clicados no deberían estar decayendo. Si bien OnlineUp es teóricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior al de BayesInt y BatchUp, probablemente debido al coeficiente de decaimiento. En general, BatchUp parece ser el mejor método cuando variamos la configuración de los parámetros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de búsqueda: historial de consultas y datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribución de cada tipo de contexto. 5.2.2 Utilizando solo el historial de consultas En cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos de historial de clics configurando los parámetros adecuadamente. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas. Utilizamos la misma configuración de parámetros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Aquí vemos que en general, el beneficio de utilizar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto difiere de lo reportado en un estudio previo [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas resultó ser consistentemente útil. Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4. Esto se debe nuevamente probablemente a que al principio la consulta inicial, que es el título en la descripción original del tema de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta; de hecho, en promedio, el rendimiento de estas consultas de primera generación es claramente inferior al de todas las demás consultas formuladas por los usuarios en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observación es que al utilizar solo el historial de consultas, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, OnlineUp y BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (α = 0.1, β = 0) (µ = 0.2,ν = 0) (µ = 5.0,ν = +∞) (µ = 2.0, ν = +∞) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas para la clasificación de documentos. µ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.0552 0.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: La precisión promedio de BatchUp utilizando solo el historial de consultas es esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan la variación causada por el parámetro µ. Un ajuste más bajo de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor más alto de 5.0. Una imagen más completa de la influencia del ajuste de µ se puede ver en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango más amplio de valores de µ. El valor de µ se puede interpretar como cuántas palabras consideramos que vale la historia de la consulta. Un valor más grande pone más peso en la historia y se considera que afecta más el rendimiento cuando la información histórica no es abundante. Por lo tanto, aunque para q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para µ ∈ [2, 5], solo cuando µ = 0.5 vemos algún pequeño beneficio para q2. Como esperaríamos, un µ excesivamente grande perjudicaría el rendimiento en general, pero q2 es el más perjudicado y q4 apenas se ve afectado, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos más información del historial de consultas, podemos poner más peso en esa información histórica. Esto también sugiere que una estrategia mejor probablemente debería ajustar dinámicamente los parámetros según la cantidad de información histórica que tengamos. Los resultados mixtos del historial de consultas sugieren que el efecto positivo de utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita puede haber provenido en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto tal como discutimos en la siguiente subsección. 5.2.3 Uso solo del historial de clics. Ahora desactivamos el historial de consultas y solo utilizamos los resúmenes clicados junto con la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de utilizar la información de clics es mucho más significativo que el de utilizar el historial de consultas. Observamos un efecto generalmente positivo, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre el punto de partida. También es claro que cuanto más ricos sean los datos del contexto, mayor será la mejora que se puede lograr al utilizar resúmenes seleccionados. Aparte de alguna degradación ocasional de la precisión en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y a menudo bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto resumido seleccionado es generalmente bastante útil para inferir la necesidad de información de un usuario. Intuitivamente, tiene más sentido utilizar el resumen del texto en lugar del contenido real del documento, ya que es bastante posible que el documento detrás de un resumen aparentemente relevante en realidad no lo sea. 29 de los 91 documentos clicados son relevantes. Actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en dichos resúmenes elevaría la clasificación de estos documentos relevantes, lo que provocaría una mejora en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, tal mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuánta mejora hemos logrado en la mejora de los rangos de los documentos relevantes no vistos, excluimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recalculamos el rendimiento de BayesInt y la línea base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Ten en cuenta que el rendimiento del método base es menor debido a la eliminación de los 29 documentos relevantes, los cuales habrían sido generalmente clasificados en los primeros puestos de los resultados. Desde la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resúmenes clicados también ayuda a mejorar significativamente las clasificaciones de documentos relevantes no vistos. La pregunta restante es si los datos de clics siguen siendo útiles si ninguno de los documentos clicados es relevante. Para responder a esta pregunta, extraímos los 29 resúmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto más pequeño de resúmenes clicados HC, y reevaluamos el rendimiento del método BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuración de parámetros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisión promedio mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan solo en 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, es más probable que un usuario haga clic en algunos resúmenes relevantes, lo que ayudaría a mostrar más documentos relevantes, como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5. Tabla 4: Efecto de utilizar solo datos de clics para la clasificación de documentos. El beneficio de la información del historial de consultas y la información de clics es principalmente aditivo, es decir, combinarlos puede lograr un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno por separado, pero la mayor parte de la mejora claramente proviene de la información de clics. En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el método BatchUp. Sensibilidad de parámetros. Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parámetros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y Qk, aunque la parametrización es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsección, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parámetros para BatchUp, que parece tener un rendimiento relativamente mejor que otros. BatchUp tiene dos parámetros µ y ν. Primero miramos a µ. Cuando µ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se utiliza en absoluto, y esencialmente solo usamos los datos de clics combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos µ, incorporaremos gradualmente más información de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cómo la precisión promedio de BatchUp cambia a medida que variamos µ con ν fijo en 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp. Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2. El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores. Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando µ está alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la información de consultas anteriores es tan útil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por q2, claramente hay un cierto equilibrio entre la consulta actual y las consultas anteriores. Consulta MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Mejora 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Mejora 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Mejora 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Mejora 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Mejora 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Mejora 77.2% 16.4% Tabla 7: El beneficio aditivo de la información de contexto y el uso de una combinación equilibrada de ellas logra un mejor rendimiento que usar cada una por separado. Ahora pasamos al otro parámetro ν. Cuando ν se establece en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics; cuando ν se establece en +∞, solo usamos el historial de consultas y la consulta actual. Con µ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp, variamos ν y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando ν ≤ 30, con frecuencia el mejor rendimiento se logra en ν = 15. Esto significa que la información combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan útil como aproximadamente 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la información de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que BatchUp no solo tiene un mejor rendimiento que otros métodos, sino que también es bastante robusto. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJOS FUTUROS En este artículo, hemos explorado cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluida la historia de consultas y la historia de clics dentro de la misma sesión de búsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación de información. Usando el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos estadísticos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir ningún esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede ampliar de varias maneras: en primer lugar, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar información de retroalimentación implícita. Sería interesante desarrollar modelos más sofisticados para aprovechar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar de manera diferente un resumen seleccionado dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalización o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. Segundo, los modelos propuestos pueden ser implementados en cualquier sistema práctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de búsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporará algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. También realizaremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la búsqueda web real. Finalmente, deberíamos estudiar más a fondo un marco general de recuperación para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperación de información interactiva y estudiar cómo optimizar algunos de los parámetros en los modelos de recuperación sensibles al contexto. 7.

        "Context-Sensitive Information Retrieval Using Implicit Feedback Xuehua Shen Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Bin Tan Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ChengXiang Zhai Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ABSTRACT A major limitation of most existing retrieval models and systems is that the retrieval decision is made based solely on the query and document collection; information about the actual user and search context is largely ignored.",
        "In this paper, we study how to exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve retrieval accuracy in an interactive information retrieval setting.",
        "We propose several contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents.",
        "We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set.",
        "Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
        "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
        "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
        "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
        "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
        "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
        "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
        "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
        "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
        "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
        "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
        "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
        "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
        "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
        "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
        "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
        "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
        "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
        "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
        "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
        "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
        "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
        "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
        "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
        "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
        "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
        "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
        "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",
        "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
        "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
        "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
        "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",
        "The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user.",
        "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.",
        "In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models.",
        "In Section 4, we describe how we create the data set for implicit feedback experiments.",
        "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
        "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
        "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
        "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
        "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
        "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
        "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
        "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
        "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
        "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
        "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
        "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
        "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
        "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
        "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
        "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
        "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
        "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
        "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
        "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
        "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
        "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
        "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
        "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
        "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
        "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
        "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
        "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
        "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
        "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
        "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
        "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
        "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
        "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
        "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
        "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
        "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
        "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
        "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
        "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
        "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
        "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
        "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
        "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
        "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
        "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
        "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
        "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
        "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
        "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
        "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
        "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
        "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
        "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
        "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
        "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
        "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
        "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
        "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
        "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
        "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
        "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
        "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
        "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
        "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
        "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
        "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
        "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
        "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
        "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
        "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
        "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
        "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
        "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
        "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
        "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
        "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
        "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
        "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
        "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
        "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
        "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
        "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
        "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
        "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
        "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
        "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
        "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
        "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
        "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
        "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
        "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
        "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
        "There are two choices.",
        "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
        "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
        "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
        "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
        "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
        "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",
        "There are altogether 242918 news articles and the average document length is 416 words.",
        "Most articles have titles.",
        "If not, we select the first sentence of the text as the title.",
        "For the preprocessing, we only do case folding and do not do stopword removal or stemming.",
        "We select 30 relatively difficult topics from TREC topics 1-150.",
        "These 30 topics have the worst average precision performance among TREC topics 1-150 according to some baseline experiments using the KL-Divergence model with Bayesian prior smoothing [20].",
        "The reason why we select difficult topics is that the user then would have to have several interactions with the retrieval system in order to get satisfactory results so that we can expect to collect a relatively richer query history and clickthrough history data from the user.",
        "In real applications, we may also expect our models to be most useful for such difficult topics, so our data collection strategy reflects the real world applications well.",
        "We index the TREC AP data set and set up a search engine and web interface for TREC AP news articles.",
        "We use 3 subjects to do experiments to collect query history and clickthrough history data.",
        "Each subject is assigned 10 topics and given the topic descriptions provided by TREC.",
        "For each topic, the first query is the title of the topic given in the original TREC topic description.",
        "After the subject submits the query, the search engine will do retrieval and return a ranked list of search results to the subject.",
        "The subject will browse the results and maybe click one or more results to browse the full text of article(s).",
        "The subject may also modify the query to do another search.",
        "For each topic, the subject composes at least 4 queries.",
        "In our experiment, only the first 4 queries for each topic are used.",
        "The user needs to select the topic number from a selection menu before submitting the query to the search engine so that we can easily detect the session boundary, which is not the focus of our study.",
        "We use a relational database to store user interactions, including the submitted queries and clicked documents.",
        "For each query, we store the query terms and the associated result pages.",
        "And for each clicked document, we store the summary as shown on the search result page.",
        "The summary of the article is query dependent and is computed online using fixed-length passage retrieval (KL divergence model with Bayesian prior smoothing).",
        "Among 120 (4 for each of 30 topics) queries which we study in the experiment, the average query length is 3.71 words.",

        "We also vary the parameters to study the sensitivity of our algorithms to the setting of the parameters. 5.2 Result analysis 5.2.1 Overall effect of search context We compare the optimal performances of four models with those using the current query only in Table 1.",
        "A row labeled with qi is the baseline performance and a row labeled with qi + HQ + HC is the performance of using search context.",
        "We can make several observations from this table: 1.",
        "Comparing the baseline performances indicates that on average reformulated queries are better than the previous queries with the performance of q4 being the best.",
        "Users generally formulate better and better queries. 2.",
        "Using search context generally has positive effect, especially when the context is rich.",
        "This can be seen from the fact that the 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip improvement for q4 and q3 is generally more substantial compared with q2.",
        "Actually, in many cases with q2, using the context may hurt the performance, probably because the history at that point is sparse.",
        "When the search context is rich, the performance improvement can be quite substantial.",
        "For example, BatchUp achieves 92.4% improvement in the mean average precision over q3 and 77.2% improvement over q4. (The generally low precisions also make the relative improvement deceptively high, though.) 3.",
        "Among the four models using search context, the performances of FixInt and OnlineUp are clearly worse than those of BayesInt and BatchUp.",
        "Since BayesInt performs better than FixInt and the main difference between BayesInt and FixInt is that the former uses an adaptive coefficient for interpolation, the results suggest that using adaptive coefficient is quite beneficial and a Bayesian style interpolation makes sense.",
        "The main difference between OnlineUp and BatchUp is that OnlineUp uses decaying coefficients to combine the multiple clicked summaries, while BatchUp simply concatenates all clicked summaries.",
        "Therefore the fact that BatchUp is consistently better than OnlineUp indicates that the weights for combining the clicked summaries indeed should not be decaying.",
        "While OnlineUp is theoretically appealing, its performance is inferior to BayesInt and BatchUp, likely because of the decaying coefficient.",
        "Overall, BatchUp appears to be the best method when we vary the parameter settings.",
        "We have two different kinds of search context - query history and clickthrough data.",
        "We now look into the contribution of each kind of context. 5.2.2 Using query history only In each of four models, we can turn off the clickthrough history data by setting parameters appropriately.",
        "This allows us to evaluate the effect of using query history alone.",
        "We use the same parameter setting for query history as in Table 1.",

        "This is different from what is reported in a previous study [15], where using query history is consistently helpful.",
        "Another observation is that the context runs perform poorly at q2, but generally perform (slightly) better than the baselines for q3 and q4.",
        "This is again likely because at the beginning the initial query, which is the title in the original TREC topic description, may not be a good query; indeed, on average, performances of these first-generation queries are clearly poorer than those of all other user-formulated queries in the later generations.",

        "In addition to the fact that q1 is generally worse than q2, q3, and q4, another possible reason why the sensitivity is lower for q3 and q4 may be that we generally have more clickthrough data available for q3 and q4 than for q2, and the dominating influence of the clickthrough data has made the small differences caused by µ less visible for q3 and q4.",

        "A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario.",
        "Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible.",
        "De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2].",
        "Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar.",
        "La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación.",
        "Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes.",
        "Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación.",
        "Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales.",
        "Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
        "En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8].",
        "Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha.",
        "En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo).",

        "Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión.",
        "Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información.",
        "La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo.",
        "Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual.",
        "En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente.",
        "El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo.",
        "El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular.",
        "En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo.",
        "En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces.",
        "Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta.",
        "Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual.",
        "Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos.",
        "En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16].",
        "Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación.",
        "Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior.",
        "De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación.",
        "Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible.",

        "Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics.",
        "Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic.",
        "Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario.",
        "Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación.",
        "En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1.",
        "También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk.",
        "Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17].",
        "Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos.",
        "En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos.",
        "Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk.",
        "Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva.",
        "Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación.",
        "Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento.",
        "Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta.",
        "Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk.",
        "Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics.",
        "Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual.",
        "Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC.",
        "Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk).",
        "Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto.",
        "Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC).",
        "Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H).",
        "Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk).",
        "Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica.",
        "Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una interpolación de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas.",
        "Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial.",
        "Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano.",
        "El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ).",
        "Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta.",
        "De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta.",
        "Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados.",
        "Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados.",
        "Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más.",
        "Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable.",
        "Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores.",
        "Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperación interactivo, la presentamos de una manera más general.",
        "En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos.",
        "Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios.",
        "En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva).",
        "Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimación bayesiana, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la estimación bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general.",
        "Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado).",
        "Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior.",
        "Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales.",
        "Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un proceso interactivo de recuperación utilizando estimación bayesiana.",
        "En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento.",
        "Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta.",
        "Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario.",
        "Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado.",
        "Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0.",
        "Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1.",
        "El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1.",
        "A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1.",
        "Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2.",
        "En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta.",
        "Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci.",
        "En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados.",
        "Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado.",
        "Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci).",
        "Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo.",
        "Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual.",
        "En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i.",
        "Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande.",
        "Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
        "Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos.",
        "Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto.",
        "Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo.",
        "Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic.",
        "Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores.",
        "Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados.",
        "En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor.",
        "Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
        "RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema.",
        "Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno.",
        "Hay dos opciones.",
        "Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda).",
        "Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos.",
        "La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia.",
        "Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics.",
        "Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics.",

        "La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario.",
        "En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real.",

        "Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4.",

        "Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2.",
        "El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores.",
        "Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4.",

                "In this paper, we study how to exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve <br>retrieval accuracy</br> in an interactive information retrieval setting.",
                "We propose several contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents.",
                "We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set.",
                "Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve <br>retrieval accuracy</br>, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving <br>retrieval accuracy</br>.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the <br>retrieval accuracy</br> without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",

                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",

                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",

                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving <br>retrieval accuracy</br>.",

                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",

                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",

                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

                "We use two performance measures: (1) Mean Average Precision (MAP): This is the standard non-interpolated average precision and serves as a good measure of the overall ranking accuracy. (2) Precision at 20 documents (pr@20docs): This measure does not average well, but it is more meaningful than MAP and reflects the utility for users who only read the top 20 documents.",
                "In all cases, the reported figure is the average over all of the 30 topics.",

                "For example, BatchUp achieves 92.4% improvement in the mean average precision over q3 and 77.2% improvement over q4. (The generally low precisions also make the relative improvement deceptively high, though.) 3.",
                "Among the four models using search context, the performances of FixInt and OnlineUp are clearly worse than those of BayesInt and BatchUp.",
                "Since BayesInt performs better than FixInt and the main difference between BayesInt and FixInt is that the former uses an adaptive coefficient for interpolation, the results suggest that using adaptive coefficient is quite beneficial and a Bayesian style interpolation makes sense.",
                "The main difference between OnlineUp and BatchUp is that OnlineUp uses decaying coefficients to combine the multiple clicked summaries, while BatchUp simply concatenates all clicked summaries.",
                "Therefore the fact that BatchUp is consistently better than OnlineUp indicates that the weights for combining the clicked summaries indeed should not be decaying.",
                "While OnlineUp is theoretically appealing, its performance is inferior to BayesInt and BatchUp, likely because of the decaying coefficient.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la <br>precisión de recuperación</br> en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la <br>precisión de la recuperación</br>, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la <br>precisión de recuperación</br>. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la <br>precisión de recuperación</br> sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la <br>precisión de recuperación</br>.

                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",

                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",

                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

                "Most articles have titles.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la <br>información de retroalimentación implícita</br>, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha <br>información de retroalimentación implícita</br> puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar <br>información de retroalimentación implícita</br>, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con <br>información de retroalimentación implícita</br>, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de <br>información de retroalimentación implícita</br>, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario.

                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "<br>relevance feedback</br> [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, <br>relevance feedback</br> requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of <br>relevance feedback</br> may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",

                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La <br>retroalimentación de relevancia</br> [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la <br>retroalimentación de relevancia</br> requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la <br>retroalimentación de relevancia</br> puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente haría clic frecuentemente en algunos documentos para verlos. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic. Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación. En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1. También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos. En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos. Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación. Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta. Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk. Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics. Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk). Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto. Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una interpolación de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial. Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ). Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta. Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperación interactivo, la presentamos de una manera más general. En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva). Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimación bayesiana, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la estimación bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior. Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales. Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un proceso interactivo de recuperación utilizando estimación bayesiana. En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0. Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1. Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados. Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado. Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci). Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual. En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto. Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados. En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos. La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia. Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos de TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de texto, porque los datos de AP han sido utilizados en varias tareas de TREC y cuentan con juicios relativamente completos. Hay en total 242918 artículos de noticias y la longitud promedio de los documentos es de 416 palabras. La mayoría de los artículos tienen títulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oración del texto como título. Para el preprocesamiento, solo realizamos la conversión a minúsculas y no eliminamos stopwords ni realizamos stemming. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difíciles de los temas TREC 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisión entre los temas 1-150 de TREC según algunos experimentos de referencia utilizando el modelo de Divergencia de KL con suavizado de priorización bayesiana [20]. La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexamos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de búsqueda e interfaz web para los artículos de noticias de TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para realizar experimentos y recopilar datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asignan 10 temas y se le proporcionan las descripciones de los temas proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el título del tema dado en la descripción original del tema de TREC. Después de que el sujeto envíe la consulta, el motor de búsqueda realizará la recuperación y devolverá una lista clasificada de resultados de búsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto revisará los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o más resultados para leer el texto completo del artículo o artículos. El sujeto también puede modificar la consulta para realizar otra búsqueda. Para cada tema, el sujeto compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el número del tema de un menú de selección antes de enviar la consulta al motor de búsqueda para que podamos detectar fácilmente el límite de la sesión, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones de los usuarios, incluyendo las consultas enviadas y los documentos clicados. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los términos de la consulta y las páginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento clicado, almacenamos el resumen tal como se muestra en la página de resultados de búsqueda. El resumen del artículo es dependiente de la consulta y se calcula en línea utilizando la recuperación de pasajes de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado de prior bayesiano). De entre 120 consultas (4 para cada uno de los 30 temas) que estudiamos en el experimento, la longitud promedio de las consultas es de 3.71 palabras. En total hay 91 documentos clicados para ver. En promedio, hay alrededor de 3 clics por tema.

De los 91 documentos seleccionados, 29 documentos son considerados relevantes según el archivo de juicio de TREC. Este conjunto de datos está disponible públicamente. EXPERIMENTOS 5.1 Diseño del experimento Nuestra hipótesis principal es que el uso del contexto de búsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas y la información de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. En particular, el contexto de búsqueda puede proporcionar información adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un modelo de consulta mejor que simplemente utilizando la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de recuperación utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando así cualquier contexto) con el rendimiento utilizando tanto la consulta actual como el contexto de búsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, realizamos tales comparaciones para cada versión de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) Precisión Promedio Media (MAP): Esta es la precisión promedio estándar no interpolada y sirve como una buena medida de la precisión general de clasificación. (2) Precisión en 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es más significativa que MAP y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los primeros 20 documentos. En todos los casos, la cifra reportada es el promedio de los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de búsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parámetros (α y β para FixInt; µ y ν para los demás). Ten en cuenta que µ y ν pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes métodos. Variamos estos parámetros e identificamos el rendimiento óptimo para cada método. También variamos los parámetros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuración de los parámetros. 5.2 Análisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de búsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento óptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que utilizan solo la consulta actual en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con qi es el rendimiento base y una fila etiquetada con qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento al utilizar el contexto de búsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones a partir de esta tabla: 1. Comparar las actuaciones de referencia indica que, en promedio, las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores, siendo la actuación de q4 la mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan consultas cada vez mejores. El uso del contexto de búsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede observar en el hecho de que la mejora del 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip para q4 y q3 es generalmente más sustancial en comparación con q2. De hecho, en muchos casos con q2, el uso del contexto puede perjudicar el rendimiento, probablemente porque el historial en ese punto es escaso. Cuando el contexto de búsqueda es amplio, la mejora en el rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, BatchUp logra una mejora del 92.4% en la precisión media promedio sobre q3 y del 77.2% sobre q4. (Las precisiones generalmente bajas también hacen que la mejora relativa sea engañosamente alta, sin embargo). 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que utilizan contexto de búsqueda, las actuaciones de FixInt y OnlineUp son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y BatchUp. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que FixInt y la principal diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que el primero utiliza un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolación, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y que una interpolación de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre OnlineUp y BatchUp es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes decaídos para combinar los múltiples resúmenes clicados, mientras que BatchUp simplemente concatena todos los resúmenes clicados. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que OnlineUp indica que los pesos para combinar los resúmenes clicados no deberían estar decayendo. Si bien OnlineUp es teóricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior al de BayesInt y BatchUp, probablemente debido al coeficiente de decaimiento. En general, BatchUp parece ser el mejor método cuando variamos la configuración de los parámetros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de búsqueda: historial de consultas y datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribución de cada tipo de contexto. 5.2.2 Utilizando solo el historial de consultas En cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos de historial de clics configurando los parámetros adecuadamente. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas. Utilizamos la misma configuración de parámetros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Aquí vemos que en general, el beneficio de utilizar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto difiere de lo reportado en un estudio previo [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas resultó ser consistentemente útil. Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4. Esto se debe nuevamente probablemente a que al principio la consulta inicial, que es el título en la descripción original del tema de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta; de hecho, en promedio, el rendimiento de estas consultas de primera generación es claramente inferior al de todas las demás consultas formuladas por los usuarios en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observación es que al utilizar solo el historial de consultas, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, OnlineUp y BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (α = 0.1, β = 0) (µ = 0.2,ν = 0) (µ = 5.0,ν = +∞) (µ = 2.0, ν = +∞) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas para la clasificación de documentos. µ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.0552 0.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: La precisión promedio de BatchUp utilizando solo el historial de consultas es esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan la variación causada por el parámetro µ. Un ajuste más bajo de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor más alto de 5.0. Una imagen más completa de la influencia del ajuste de µ se puede ver en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango más amplio de valores de µ. El valor de µ se puede interpretar como cuántas palabras consideramos que vale la historia de la consulta. Un valor más grande pone más peso en la historia y se considera que afecta más el rendimiento cuando la información histórica no es abundante. Por lo tanto, aunque para q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para µ ∈ [2, 5], solo cuando µ = 0.5 vemos algún pequeño beneficio para q2. Como esperaríamos, un µ excesivamente grande perjudicaría el rendimiento en general, pero q2 es el más perjudicado y q4 apenas se ve afectado, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos más información del historial de consultas, podemos poner más peso en esa información histórica. Esto también sugiere que una estrategia mejor probablemente debería ajustar dinámicamente los parámetros según la cantidad de información histórica que tengamos. Los resultados mixtos del historial de consultas sugieren que el efecto positivo de utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita puede haber provenido en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto tal como discutimos en la siguiente subsección. 5.2.3 Uso solo del historial de clics. Ahora desactivamos el historial de consultas y solo utilizamos los resúmenes clicados junto con la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de utilizar la información de clics es mucho más significativo que el de utilizar el historial de consultas. Observamos un efecto generalmente positivo, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre el punto de partida. También es claro que cuanto más ricos sean los datos del contexto, mayor será la mejora que se puede lograr al utilizar resúmenes seleccionados. Aparte de alguna degradación ocasional de la precisión en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y a menudo bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto resumido seleccionado es generalmente bastante útil para inferir la necesidad de información de un usuario. Intuitivamente, tiene más sentido utilizar el resumen del texto en lugar del contenido real del documento, ya que es bastante posible que el documento detrás de un resumen aparentemente relevante en realidad no lo sea. 29 de los 91 documentos clicados son relevantes. Actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en dichos resúmenes elevaría la clasificación de estos documentos relevantes, lo que provocaría una mejora en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, tal mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuánta mejora hemos logrado en la mejora de los rangos de los documentos relevantes no vistos, excluimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recalculamos el rendimiento de BayesInt y la línea base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Ten en cuenta que el rendimiento del método base es menor debido a la eliminación de los 29 documentos relevantes, los cuales habrían sido generalmente clasificados en los primeros puestos de los resultados. Desde la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resúmenes clicados también ayuda a mejorar significativamente las clasificaciones de documentos relevantes no vistos. La pregunta restante es si los datos de clics siguen siendo útiles si ninguno de los documentos clicados es relevante. Para responder a esta pregunta, extraímos los 29 resúmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto más pequeño de resúmenes clicados HC, y reevaluamos el rendimiento del método BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuración de parámetros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisión promedio mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan solo en 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, es más probable que un usuario haga clic en algunos resúmenes relevantes, lo que ayudaría a mostrar más documentos relevantes, como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5. Tabla 4: Efecto de utilizar solo datos de clics para la clasificación de documentos. El beneficio de la información del historial de consultas y la información de clics es principalmente aditivo, es decir, combinarlos puede lograr un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno por separado, pero la mayor parte de la mejora claramente proviene de la información de clics. En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el método BatchUp. Sensibilidad de parámetros. Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parámetros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y Qk, aunque la parametrización es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsección, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parámetros para BatchUp, que parece tener un rendimiento relativamente mejor que otros. BatchUp tiene dos parámetros µ y ν. Primero miramos a µ. Cuando µ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se utiliza en absoluto, y esencialmente solo usamos los datos de clics combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos µ, incorporaremos gradualmente más información de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cómo la precisión promedio de BatchUp cambia a medida que variamos µ con ν fijo en 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp. Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2. El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores. Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando µ está alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la información de consultas anteriores es tan útil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por q2, claramente hay un cierto equilibrio entre la consulta actual y las consultas anteriores. Consulta MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Mejora 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Mejora 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Mejora 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Mejora 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Mejora 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Mejora 77.2% 16.4% Tabla 7: El beneficio aditivo de la información de contexto y el uso de una combinación equilibrada de ellas logra un mejor rendimiento que usar cada una por separado. Ahora pasamos al otro parámetro ν. Cuando ν se establece en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics; cuando ν se establece en +∞, solo usamos el historial de consultas y la consulta actual. Con µ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp, variamos ν y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando ν ≤ 30, con frecuencia el mejor rendimiento se logra en ν = 15. Esto significa que la información combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan útil como aproximadamente 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la información de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que BatchUp no solo tiene un mejor rendimiento que otros métodos, sino que también es bastante robusto. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJOS FUTUROS En este artículo, hemos explorado cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluida la historia de consultas y la historia de clics dentro de la misma sesión de búsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación de información. Usando el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos estadísticos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir ningún esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede ampliar de varias maneras: en primer lugar, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar información de retroalimentación implícita. Sería interesante desarrollar modelos más sofisticados para aprovechar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar de manera diferente un resumen seleccionado dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalización o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. Segundo, los modelos propuestos pueden ser implementados en cualquier sistema práctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de búsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporará algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. También realizaremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la búsqueda web real. Finalmente, deberíamos estudiar más a fondo un marco general de recuperación para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperación de información interactiva y estudiar cómo optimizar algunos de los parámetros en los modelos de recuperación sensibles al contexto. 7.

                "Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an <br>interactive retrieval</br> scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",

                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",
                "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
                "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
                "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",
                "The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.",

                "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",

                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",

                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an <br>interactive retrieval</br> process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",

                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de <br>recuperación interactiva</br>, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente haría clic frecuentemente en algunos documentos para verlos. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic. Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación. En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1. También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos. En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos. Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación. Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta. Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk. Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics. Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk). Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto. Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una interpolación de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial. Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ). Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta. Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de <br>recuperación interactivo</br>, la presentamos de una manera más general. En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva). Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimación bayesiana, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la estimación bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior. Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales. Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un <br>proceso interactivo</br> de recuperación utilizando estimación bayesiana. En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0. Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1. Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados. Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado. Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci). Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual. En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto. Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados. En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos. La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia. Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos de TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de texto, porque los datos de AP han sido utilizados en varias tareas de TREC y cuentan con juicios relativamente completos. Hay en total 242918 artículos de noticias y la longitud promedio de los documentos es de 416 palabras. La mayoría de los artículos tienen títulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oración del texto como título. Para el preprocesamiento, solo realizamos la conversión a minúsculas y no eliminamos stopwords ni realizamos stemming. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difíciles de los temas TREC 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisión entre los temas 1-150 de TREC según algunos experimentos de referencia utilizando el modelo de Divergencia de KL con suavizado de priorización bayesiana [20]. La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexamos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de búsqueda e interfaz web para los artículos de noticias de TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para realizar experimentos y recopilar datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asignan 10 temas y se le proporcionan las descripciones de los temas proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el título del tema dado en la descripción original del tema de TREC. Después de que el sujeto envíe la consulta, el motor de búsqueda realizará la recuperación y devolverá una lista clasificada de resultados de búsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto revisará los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o más resultados para leer el texto completo del artículo o artículos. El sujeto también puede modificar la consulta para realizar otra búsqueda. Para cada tema, el sujeto compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el número del tema de un menú de selección antes de enviar la consulta al motor de búsqueda para que podamos detectar fácilmente el límite de la sesión, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones de los usuarios, incluyendo las consultas enviadas y los documentos clicados. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los términos de la consulta y las páginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento clicado, almacenamos el resumen tal como se muestra en la página de resultados de búsqueda. El resumen del artículo es dependiente de la consulta y se calcula en línea utilizando la recuperación de pasajes de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado de prior bayesiano). De entre 120 consultas (4 para cada uno de los 30 temas) que estudiamos en el experimento, la longitud promedio de las consultas es de 3.71 palabras. En total hay 91 documentos clicados para ver. En promedio, hay alrededor de 3 clics por tema.

De los 91 documentos seleccionados, 29 documentos son considerados relevantes según el archivo de juicio de TREC. Este conjunto de datos está disponible públicamente. EXPERIMENTOS 5.1 Diseño del experimento Nuestra hipótesis principal es que el uso del contexto de búsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas y la información de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. En particular, el contexto de búsqueda puede proporcionar información adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un modelo de consulta mejor que simplemente utilizando la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de recuperación utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando así cualquier contexto) con el rendimiento utilizando tanto la consulta actual como el contexto de búsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, realizamos tales comparaciones para cada versión de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) Precisión Promedio Media (MAP): Esta es la precisión promedio estándar no interpolada y sirve como una buena medida de la precisión general de clasificación. (2) Precisión en 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es más significativa que MAP y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los primeros 20 documentos. En todos los casos, la cifra reportada es el promedio de los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de búsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parámetros (α y β para FixInt; µ y ν para los demás). Ten en cuenta que µ y ν pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes métodos. Variamos estos parámetros e identificamos el rendimiento óptimo para cada método. También variamos los parámetros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuración de los parámetros. 5.2 Análisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de búsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento óptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que utilizan solo la consulta actual en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con qi es el rendimiento base y una fila etiquetada con qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento al utilizar el contexto de búsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones a partir de esta tabla: 1. Comparar las actuaciones de referencia indica que, en promedio, las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores, siendo la actuación de q4 la mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan consultas cada vez mejores. El uso del contexto de búsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede observar en el hecho de que la mejora del 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip para q4 y q3 es generalmente más sustancial en comparación con q2. De hecho, en muchos casos con q2, el uso del contexto puede perjudicar el rendimiento, probablemente porque el historial en ese punto es escaso. Cuando el contexto de búsqueda es amplio, la mejora en el rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, BatchUp logra una mejora del 92.4% en la precisión media promedio sobre q3 y del 77.2% sobre q4. (Las precisiones generalmente bajas también hacen que la mejora relativa sea engañosamente alta, sin embargo). 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que utilizan contexto de búsqueda, las actuaciones de FixInt y OnlineUp son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y BatchUp. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que FixInt y la principal diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que el primero utiliza un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolación, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y que una interpolación de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre OnlineUp y BatchUp es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes decaídos para combinar los múltiples resúmenes clicados, mientras que BatchUp simplemente concatena todos los resúmenes clicados. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que OnlineUp indica que los pesos para combinar los resúmenes clicados no deberían estar decayendo. Si bien OnlineUp es teóricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior al de BayesInt y BatchUp, probablemente debido al coeficiente de decaimiento. En general, BatchUp parece ser el mejor método cuando variamos la configuración de los parámetros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de búsqueda: historial de consultas y datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribución de cada tipo de contexto. 5.2.2 Utilizando solo el historial de consultas En cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos de historial de clics configurando los parámetros adecuadamente. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas. Utilizamos la misma configuración de parámetros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Aquí vemos que en general, el beneficio de utilizar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto difiere de lo reportado en un estudio previo [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas resultó ser consistentemente útil. Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4. Esto se debe nuevamente probablemente a que al principio la consulta inicial, que es el título en la descripción original del tema de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta; de hecho, en promedio, el rendimiento de estas consultas de primera generación es claramente inferior al de todas las demás consultas formuladas por los usuarios en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observación es que al utilizar solo el historial de consultas, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, OnlineUp y BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (α = 0.1, β = 0) (µ = 0.2,ν = 0) (µ = 5.0,ν = +∞) (µ = 2.0, ν = +∞) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas para la clasificación de documentos. µ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.0552 0.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: La precisión promedio de BatchUp utilizando solo el historial de consultas es esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan la variación causada por el parámetro µ. Un ajuste más bajo de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor más alto de 5.0. Una imagen más completa de la influencia del ajuste de µ se puede ver en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango más amplio de valores de µ. El valor de µ se puede interpretar como cuántas palabras consideramos que vale la historia de la consulta. Un valor más grande pone más peso en la historia y se considera que afecta más el rendimiento cuando la información histórica no es abundante. Por lo tanto, aunque para q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para µ ∈ [2, 5], solo cuando µ = 0.5 vemos algún pequeño beneficio para q2. Como esperaríamos, un µ excesivamente grande perjudicaría el rendimiento en general, pero q2 es el más perjudicado y q4 apenas se ve afectado, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos más información del historial de consultas, podemos poner más peso en esa información histórica. Esto también sugiere que una estrategia mejor probablemente debería ajustar dinámicamente los parámetros según la cantidad de información histórica que tengamos. Los resultados mixtos del historial de consultas sugieren que el efecto positivo de utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita puede haber provenido en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto tal como discutimos en la siguiente subsección. 5.2.3 Uso solo del historial de clics. Ahora desactivamos el historial de consultas y solo utilizamos los resúmenes clicados junto con la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de utilizar la información de clics es mucho más significativo que el de utilizar el historial de consultas. Observamos un efecto generalmente positivo, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre el punto de partida. También es claro que cuanto más ricos sean los datos del contexto, mayor será la mejora que se puede lograr al utilizar resúmenes seleccionados. Aparte de alguna degradación ocasional de la precisión en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y a menudo bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto resumido seleccionado es generalmente bastante útil para inferir la necesidad de información de un usuario. Intuitivamente, tiene más sentido utilizar el resumen del texto en lugar del contenido real del documento, ya que es bastante posible que el documento detrás de un resumen aparentemente relevante en realidad no lo sea. 29 de los 91 documentos clicados son relevantes. Actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en dichos resúmenes elevaría la clasificación de estos documentos relevantes, lo que provocaría una mejora en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, tal mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuánta mejora hemos logrado en la mejora de los rangos de los documentos relevantes no vistos, excluimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recalculamos el rendimiento de BayesInt y la línea base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Ten en cuenta que el rendimiento del método base es menor debido a la eliminación de los 29 documentos relevantes, los cuales habrían sido generalmente clasificados en los primeros puestos de los resultados. Desde la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resúmenes clicados también ayuda a mejorar significativamente las clasificaciones de documentos relevantes no vistos. La pregunta restante es si los datos de clics siguen siendo útiles si ninguno de los documentos clicados es relevante. Para responder a esta pregunta, extraímos los 29 resúmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto más pequeño de resúmenes clicados HC, y reevaluamos el rendimiento del método BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuración de parámetros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisión promedio mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan solo en 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, es más probable que un usuario haga clic en algunos resúmenes relevantes, lo que ayudaría a mostrar más documentos relevantes, como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5. Tabla 4: Efecto de utilizar solo datos de clics para la clasificación de documentos. El beneficio de la información del historial de consultas y la información de clics es principalmente aditivo, es decir, combinarlos puede lograr un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno por separado, pero la mayor parte de la mejora claramente proviene de la información de clics. En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el método BatchUp. Sensibilidad de parámetros. Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parámetros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y Qk, aunque la parametrización es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsección, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parámetros para BatchUp, que parece tener un rendimiento relativamente mejor que otros. BatchUp tiene dos parámetros µ y ν. Primero miramos a µ. Cuando µ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se utiliza en absoluto, y esencialmente solo usamos los datos de clics combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos µ, incorporaremos gradualmente más información de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cómo la precisión promedio de BatchUp cambia a medida que variamos µ con ν fijo en 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp. Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2. El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores. Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando µ está alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la información de consultas anteriores es tan útil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por q2, claramente hay un cierto equilibrio entre la consulta actual y las consultas anteriores. Consulta MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Mejora 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Mejora 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Mejora 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Mejora 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Mejora 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Mejora 77.2% 16.4% Tabla 7: El beneficio aditivo de la información de contexto y el uso de una combinación equilibrada de ellas logra un mejor rendimiento que usar cada una por separado. Ahora pasamos al otro parámetro ν. Cuando ν se establece en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics; cuando ν se establece en +∞, solo usamos el historial de consultas y la consulta actual. Con µ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp, variamos ν y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando ν ≤ 30, con frecuencia el mejor rendimiento se logra en ν = 15. Esto significa que la información combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan útil como aproximadamente 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la información de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que BatchUp no solo tiene un mejor rendimiento que otros métodos, sino que también es bastante robusto. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJOS FUTUROS En este artículo, hemos explorado cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluida la historia de consultas y la historia de clics dentro de la misma sesión de búsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación de información. Usando el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos estadísticos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir ningún esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede ampliar de varias maneras: en primer lugar, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar información de retroalimentación implícita. Sería interesante desarrollar modelos más sofisticados para aprovechar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar de manera diferente un resumen seleccionado dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalización o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. Segundo, los modelos propuestos pueden ser implementados en cualquier sistema práctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de búsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporará algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. También realizaremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la búsqueda web real. Finalmente, deberíamos estudiar más a fondo un marco general de recuperación para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperación de información interactiva y estudiar cómo optimizar algunos de los parámetros en los modelos de recuperación sensibles al contexto. 7.

                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",

                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",

                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",

                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el <br>modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL</br> [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente haría clic frecuentemente en algunos documentos para verlos. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic. Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación. En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1. También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos. En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos. Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación. Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta. Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk. Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics. Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk). Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto. Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una interpolación de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial. Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ). Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta. Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperación interactivo, la presentamos de una manera más general. En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva). Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimación bayesiana, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la estimación bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior. Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales. Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un proceso interactivo de recuperación utilizando estimación bayesiana. En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0. Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1. Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados. Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado. Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci). Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual. En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto. Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados. En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos. La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia. Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos de TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de texto, porque los datos de AP han sido utilizados en varias tareas de TREC y cuentan con juicios relativamente completos. Hay en total 242918 artículos de noticias y la longitud promedio de los documentos es de 416 palabras. La mayoría de los artículos tienen títulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oración del texto como título. Para el preprocesamiento, solo realizamos la conversión a minúsculas y no eliminamos stopwords ni realizamos stemming. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difíciles de los temas TREC 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisión entre los temas 1-150 de TREC según algunos experimentos de referencia utilizando el modelo de Divergencia de KL con suavizado de priorización bayesiana [20]. La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexamos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de búsqueda e interfaz web para los artículos de noticias de TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para realizar experimentos y recopilar datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asignan 10 temas y se le proporcionan las descripciones de los temas proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el título del tema dado en la descripción original del tema de TREC. Después de que el sujeto envíe la consulta, el motor de búsqueda realizará la recuperación y devolverá una lista clasificada de resultados de búsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto revisará los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o más resultados para leer el texto completo del artículo o artículos. El sujeto también puede modificar la consulta para realizar otra búsqueda. Para cada tema, el sujeto compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el número del tema de un menú de selección antes de enviar la consulta al motor de búsqueda para que podamos detectar fácilmente el límite de la sesión, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones de los usuarios, incluyendo las consultas enviadas y los documentos clicados. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los términos de la consulta y las páginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento clicado, almacenamos el resumen tal como se muestra en la página de resultados de búsqueda. El resumen del artículo es dependiente de la consulta y se calcula en línea utilizando la recuperación de pasajes de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado de prior bayesiano).

De los 91 documentos seleccionados, 29 documentos son considerados relevantes según el archivo de juicio de TREC. Este conjunto de datos está disponible públicamente. EXPERIMENTOS 5.1 Diseño del experimento Nuestra hipótesis principal es que el uso del contexto de búsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas y la información de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. En particular, el contexto de búsqueda puede proporcionar información adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un modelo de consulta mejor que simplemente utilizando la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de recuperación utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando así cualquier contexto) con el rendimiento utilizando tanto la consulta actual como el contexto de búsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, realizamos tales comparaciones para cada versión de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) Precisión Promedio Media (MAP): Esta es la precisión promedio estándar no interpolada y sirve como una buena medida de la precisión general de clasificación. (2) Precisión en 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es más significativa que MAP y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los primeros 20 documentos. En todos los casos, la cifra reportada es el promedio de los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de búsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parámetros (α y β para FixInt; µ y ν para los demás). Ten en cuenta que µ y ν pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes métodos. Variamos estos parámetros e identificamos el rendimiento óptimo para cada método. También variamos los parámetros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuración de los parámetros. 5.2 Análisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de búsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento óptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que utilizan solo la consulta actual en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con qi es el rendimiento base y una fila etiquetada con qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento al utilizar el contexto de búsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones a partir de esta tabla: 1. Comparar las actuaciones de referencia indica que, en promedio, las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores, siendo la actuación de q4 la mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan consultas cada vez mejores. El uso del contexto de búsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede observar en el hecho de que la mejora del 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip para q4 y q3 es generalmente más sustancial en comparación con q2. De hecho, en muchos casos con q2, el uso del contexto puede perjudicar el rendimiento, probablemente porque el historial en ese punto es escaso. Cuando el contexto de búsqueda es amplio, la mejora en el rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, BatchUp logra una mejora del 92.4% en la precisión media promedio sobre q3 y del 77.2% sobre q4. (Las precisiones generalmente bajas también hacen que la mejora relativa sea engañosamente alta, sin embargo). 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que utilizan contexto de búsqueda, las actuaciones de FixInt y OnlineUp son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y BatchUp. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que FixInt y la principal diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que el primero utiliza un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolación, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y que una interpolación de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre OnlineUp y BatchUp es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes decaídos para combinar los múltiples resúmenes clicados, mientras que BatchUp simplemente concatena todos los resúmenes clicados. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que OnlineUp indica que los pesos para combinar los resúmenes clicados no deberían estar decayendo. Si bien OnlineUp es teóricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior al de BayesInt y BatchUp, probablemente debido al coeficiente de decaimiento. En general, BatchUp parece ser el mejor método cuando variamos la configuración de los parámetros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de búsqueda: historial de consultas y datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribución de cada tipo de contexto. 5.2.2 Utilizando solo el historial de consultas En cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos de historial de clics configurando los parámetros adecuadamente. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas. Utilizamos la misma configuración de parámetros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Aquí vemos que en general, el beneficio de utilizar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto difiere de lo reportado en un estudio previo [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas resultó ser consistentemente útil. Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4. Esto se debe nuevamente probablemente a que al principio la consulta inicial, que es el título en la descripción original del tema de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta; de hecho, en promedio, el rendimiento de estas consultas de primera generación es claramente inferior al de todas las demás consultas formuladas por los usuarios en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observación es que al utilizar solo el historial de consultas, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, OnlineUp y BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (α = 0.1, β = 0) (µ = 0.2,ν = 0) (µ = 5.0,ν = +∞) (µ = 2.0, ν = +∞) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas para la clasificación de documentos. µ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.0552 0.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: La precisión promedio de BatchUp utilizando solo el historial de consultas es esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan la variación causada por el parámetro µ. Un ajuste más bajo de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor más alto de 5.0. Una imagen más completa de la influencia del ajuste de µ se puede ver en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango más amplio de valores de µ. El valor de µ se puede interpretar como cuántas palabras consideramos que vale la historia de la consulta. Un valor más grande pone más peso en la historia y se considera que afecta más el rendimiento cuando la información histórica no es abundante. Por lo tanto, aunque para q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para µ ∈ [2, 5], solo cuando µ = 0.5 vemos algún pequeño beneficio para q2. Como esperaríamos, un µ excesivamente grande perjudicaría el rendimiento en general, pero q2 es el más perjudicado y q4 apenas se ve afectado, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos más información del historial de consultas, podemos poner más peso en esa información histórica. Esto también sugiere que una estrategia mejor probablemente debería ajustar dinámicamente los parámetros según la cantidad de información histórica que tengamos. Los resultados mixtos del historial de consultas sugieren que el efecto positivo de utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita puede haber provenido en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto tal como discutimos en la siguiente subsección. 5.2.3 Uso solo del historial de clics. Ahora desactivamos el historial de consultas y solo utilizamos los resúmenes clicados junto con la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de utilizar la información de clics es mucho más significativo que el de utilizar el historial de consultas. Observamos un efecto generalmente positivo, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre el punto de partida. También es claro que cuanto más ricos sean los datos del contexto, mayor será la mejora que se puede lograr al utilizar resúmenes seleccionados. Aparte de alguna degradación ocasional de la precisión en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y a menudo bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto resumido seleccionado es generalmente bastante útil para inferir la necesidad de información de un usuario. Intuitivamente, tiene más sentido utilizar el resumen del texto en lugar del contenido real del documento, ya que es bastante posible que el documento detrás de un resumen aparentemente relevante en realidad no lo sea. 29 de los 91 documentos clicados son relevantes. Actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en dichos resúmenes elevaría la clasificación de estos documentos relevantes, lo que provocaría una mejora en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, tal mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuánta mejora hemos logrado en la mejora de los rangos de los documentos relevantes no vistos, excluimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recalculamos el rendimiento de BayesInt y la línea base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Ten en cuenta que el rendimiento del método base es menor debido a la eliminación de los 29 documentos relevantes, los cuales habrían sido generalmente clasificados en los primeros puestos de los resultados. Desde la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resúmenes clicados también ayuda a mejorar significativamente las clasificaciones de documentos relevantes no vistos. La pregunta restante es si los datos de clics siguen siendo útiles si ninguno de los documentos clicados es relevante. Para responder a esta pregunta, extraímos los 29 resúmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto más pequeño de resúmenes clicados HC, y reevaluamos el rendimiento del método BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuración de parámetros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisión promedio mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan solo en 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, es más probable que un usuario haga clic en algunos resúmenes relevantes, lo que ayudaría a mostrar más documentos relevantes, como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5. Tabla 4: Efecto de utilizar solo datos de clics para la clasificación de documentos. El beneficio de la información del historial de consultas y la información de clics es principalmente aditivo, es decir, combinarlos puede lograr un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno por separado, pero la mayor parte de la mejora claramente proviene de la información de clics. En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el método BatchUp. Sensibilidad de parámetros. Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parámetros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y Qk, aunque la parametrización es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsección, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parámetros para BatchUp, que parece tener un rendimiento relativamente mejor que otros. BatchUp tiene dos parámetros µ y ν. Primero miramos a µ. Cuando µ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se utiliza en absoluto, y esencialmente solo usamos los datos de clics combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos µ, incorporaremos gradualmente más información de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cómo la precisión promedio de BatchUp cambia a medida que variamos µ con ν fijo en 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp. Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2. El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores. Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando µ está alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la información de consultas anteriores es tan útil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por q2, claramente hay un cierto equilibrio entre la consulta actual y las consultas anteriores. Consulta MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Mejora 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Mejora 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Mejora 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Mejora 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Mejora 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Mejora 77.2% 16.4% Tabla 7: El beneficio aditivo de la información de contexto y el uso de una combinación equilibrada de ellas logra un mejor rendimiento que usar cada una por separado. Ahora pasamos al otro parámetro ν. Cuando ν se establece en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics; cuando ν se establece en +∞, solo usamos el historial de consultas y la consulta actual. Con µ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp, variamos ν y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando ν ≤ 30, con frecuencia el mejor rendimiento se logra en ν = 15. Esto significa que la información combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan útil como aproximadamente 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la información de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que BatchUp no solo tiene un mejor rendimiento que otros métodos, sino que también es bastante robusto. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJOS FUTUROS En este artículo, hemos explorado cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluida la historia de consultas y la historia de clics dentro de la misma sesión de búsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación de información. Usando el <br>modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL</br> como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos estadísticos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir ningún esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede ampliar de varias maneras: en primer lugar, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar información de retroalimentación implícita. Sería interesante desarrollar modelos más sofisticados para aprovechar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar de manera diferente un resumen seleccionado dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalización o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. Segundo, los modelos propuestos pueden ser implementados en cualquier sistema práctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de búsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporará algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. También realizaremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la búsqueda web real. Finalmente, deberíamos estudiar más a fondo un marco general de recuperación para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperación de información interactiva y estudiar cómo optimizar algunos de los parámetros en los modelos de recuperación sensibles al contexto. 7.

                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new <br>context-sensitive language</br> models for retrieval.",
                "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",
                "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
                "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
                "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",
                "The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.",
                "In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models.",

                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific <br>context-sensitive language</br> models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",
                "There are altogether 242918 news articles and the average document length is 416 words.",
                "Most articles have titles.",
                "If not, we select the first sentence of the text as the title.",
                "For the preprocessing, we only do case folding and do not do stopword removal or stemming.",
                "We select 30 relatively difficult topics from TREC topics 1-150.",
                "These 30 topics have the worst average precision performance among TREC topics 1-150 according to some baseline experiments using the KL-Divergence model with Bayesian prior smoothing [20].",
                "The reason why we select difficult topics is that the user then would have to have several interactions with the retrieval system in order to get satisfactory results so that we can expect to collect a relatively richer query history and clickthrough history data from the user.",
                "In real applications, we may also expect our models to be most useful for such difficult topics, so our data collection strategy reflects the real world applications well.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de <br>lenguaje sensibles al contexto</br> para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente haría clic frecuentemente en algunos documentos para verlos. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic. Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación. En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1. También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos. En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos. Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación. Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta. Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk. Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics. Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk). Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto. Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una interpolación de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial. Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ). Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta. Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperación interactivo, la presentamos de una manera más general. En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva). Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimación bayesiana, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la estimación bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior. Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales. Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un proceso interactivo de recuperación utilizando estimación bayesiana. En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0. Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1. Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados. Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado. Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci). Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual. En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto. Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados. En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos. La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia. Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos de TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de texto, porque los datos de AP han sido utilizados en varias tareas de TREC y cuentan con juicios relativamente completos. Hay en total 242918 artículos de noticias y la longitud promedio de los documentos es de 416 palabras. La mayoría de los artículos tienen títulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oración del texto como título. Para el preprocesamiento, solo realizamos la conversión a minúsculas y no eliminamos stopwords ni realizamos stemming. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difíciles de los temas TREC 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisión entre los temas 1-150 de TREC según algunos experimentos de referencia utilizando el modelo de Divergencia de KL con suavizado de priorización bayesiana [20]. La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexamos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de búsqueda e interfaz web para los artículos de noticias de TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para realizar experimentos y recopilar datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asignan 10 temas y se le proporcionan las descripciones de los temas proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el título del tema dado en la descripción original del tema de TREC. Después de que el sujeto envíe la consulta, el motor de búsqueda realizará la recuperación y devolverá una lista clasificada de resultados de búsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto revisará los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o más resultados para leer el texto completo del artículo o artículos. El sujeto también puede modificar la consulta para realizar otra búsqueda. Para cada tema, el sujeto compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el número del tema de un menú de selección antes de enviar la consulta al motor de búsqueda para que podamos detectar fácilmente el límite de la sesión, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones de los usuarios, incluyendo las consultas enviadas y los documentos clicados. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los términos de la consulta y las páginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento clicado, almacenamos el resumen tal como se muestra en la página de resultados de búsqueda. El resumen del artículo es dependiente de la consulta y se calcula en línea utilizando la recuperación de pasajes de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado de prior bayesiano). De entre 120 consultas (4 para cada uno de los 30 temas) que estudiamos en el experimento, la longitud promedio de las consultas es de 3.71 palabras. En total hay 91 documentos clicados para ver. En promedio, hay alrededor de 3 clics por tema.

De los 91 documentos seleccionados, 29 documentos son considerados relevantes según el archivo de juicio de TREC. Este conjunto de datos está disponible públicamente. EXPERIMENTOS 5.1 Diseño del experimento Nuestra hipótesis principal es que el uso del contexto de búsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas y la información de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. En particular, el contexto de búsqueda puede proporcionar información adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un modelo de consulta mejor que simplemente utilizando la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de recuperación utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando así cualquier contexto) con el rendimiento utilizando tanto la consulta actual como el contexto de búsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, realizamos tales comparaciones para cada versión de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) Precisión Promedio Media (MAP): Esta es la precisión promedio estándar no interpolada y sirve como una buena medida de la precisión general de clasificación. (2) Precisión en 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es más significativa que MAP y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los primeros 20 documentos. En todos los casos, la cifra reportada es el promedio de los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de búsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parámetros (α y β para FixInt; µ y ν para los demás). Ten en cuenta que µ y ν pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes métodos. Variamos estos parámetros e identificamos el rendimiento óptimo para cada método. También variamos los parámetros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuración de los parámetros. 5.2 Análisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de búsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento óptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que utilizan solo la consulta actual en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con qi es el rendimiento base y una fila etiquetada con qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento al utilizar el contexto de búsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones a partir de esta tabla: 1. Comparar las actuaciones de referencia indica que, en promedio, las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores, siendo la actuación de q4 la mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan consultas cada vez mejores. El uso del contexto de búsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede observar en el hecho de que la mejora del 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip para q4 y q3 es generalmente más sustancial en comparación con q2. De hecho, en muchos casos con q2, el uso del contexto puede perjudicar el rendimiento, probablemente porque el historial en ese punto es escaso. Cuando el contexto de búsqueda es amplio, la mejora en el rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, BatchUp logra una mejora del 92.4% en la precisión media promedio sobre q3 y del 77.2% sobre q4. (Las precisiones generalmente bajas también hacen que la mejora relativa sea engañosamente alta, sin embargo). 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que utilizan contexto de búsqueda, las actuaciones de FixInt y OnlineUp son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y BatchUp. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que FixInt y la principal diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que el primero utiliza un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolación, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y que una interpolación de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre OnlineUp y BatchUp es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes decaídos para combinar los múltiples resúmenes clicados, mientras que BatchUp simplemente concatena todos los resúmenes clicados. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que OnlineUp indica que los pesos para combinar los resúmenes clicados no deberían estar decayendo. Si bien OnlineUp es teóricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior al de BayesInt y BatchUp, probablemente debido al coeficiente de decaimiento. En general, BatchUp parece ser el mejor método cuando variamos la configuración de los parámetros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de búsqueda: historial de consultas y datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribución de cada tipo de contexto. 5.2.2 Utilizando solo el historial de consultas En cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos de historial de clics configurando los parámetros adecuadamente. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas. Utilizamos la misma configuración de parámetros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Aquí vemos que en general, el beneficio de utilizar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto difiere de lo reportado en un estudio previo [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas resultó ser consistentemente útil. Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4. Esto se debe nuevamente probablemente a que al principio la consulta inicial, que es el título en la descripción original del tema de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta; de hecho, en promedio, el rendimiento de estas consultas de primera generación es claramente inferior al de todas las demás consultas formuladas por los usuarios en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observación es que al utilizar solo el historial de consultas, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, OnlineUp y BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (α = 0.1, β = 0) (µ = 0.2,ν = 0) (µ = 5.0,ν = +∞) (µ = 2.0, ν = +∞) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas para la clasificación de documentos. µ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.0552 0.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: La precisión promedio de BatchUp utilizando solo el historial de consultas es esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan la variación causada por el parámetro µ. Un ajuste más bajo de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor más alto de 5.0. Una imagen más completa de la influencia del ajuste de µ se puede ver en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango más amplio de valores de µ. El valor de µ se puede interpretar como cuántas palabras consideramos que vale la historia de la consulta. Un valor más grande pone más peso en la historia y se considera que afecta más el rendimiento cuando la información histórica no es abundante. Por lo tanto, aunque para q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para µ ∈ [2, 5], solo cuando µ = 0.5 vemos algún pequeño beneficio para q2. Como esperaríamos, un µ excesivamente grande perjudicaría el rendimiento en general, pero q2 es el más perjudicado y q4 apenas se ve afectado, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos más información del historial de consultas, podemos poner más peso en esa información histórica. Esto también sugiere que una estrategia mejor probablemente debería ajustar dinámicamente los parámetros según la cantidad de información histórica que tengamos. Los resultados mixtos del historial de consultas sugieren que el efecto positivo de utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita puede haber provenido en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto tal como discutimos en la siguiente subsección. 5.2.3 Uso solo del historial de clics. Ahora desactivamos el historial de consultas y solo utilizamos los resúmenes clicados junto con la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de utilizar la información de clics es mucho más significativo que el de utilizar el historial de consultas. Observamos un efecto generalmente positivo, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre el punto de partida. También es claro que cuanto más ricos sean los datos del contexto, mayor será la mejora que se puede lograr al utilizar resúmenes seleccionados. Aparte de alguna degradación ocasional de la precisión en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y a menudo bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto resumido seleccionado es generalmente bastante útil para inferir la necesidad de información de un usuario. Intuitivamente, tiene más sentido utilizar el resumen del texto en lugar del contenido real del documento, ya que es bastante posible que el documento detrás de un resumen aparentemente relevante en realidad no lo sea. 29 de los 91 documentos clicados son relevantes. Actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en dichos resúmenes elevaría la clasificación de estos documentos relevantes, lo que provocaría una mejora en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, tal mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuánta mejora hemos logrado en la mejora de los rangos de los documentos relevantes no vistos, excluimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recalculamos el rendimiento de BayesInt y la línea base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Ten en cuenta que el rendimiento del método base es menor debido a la eliminación de los 29 documentos relevantes, los cuales habrían sido generalmente clasificados en los primeros puestos de los resultados. Desde la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resúmenes clicados también ayuda a mejorar significativamente las clasificaciones de documentos relevantes no vistos. La pregunta restante es si los datos de clics siguen siendo útiles si ninguno de los documentos clicados es relevante. Para responder a esta pregunta, extraímos los 29 resúmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto más pequeño de resúmenes clicados HC, y reevaluamos el rendimiento del método BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuración de parámetros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisión promedio mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan solo en 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, es más probable que un usuario haga clic en algunos resúmenes relevantes, lo que ayudaría a mostrar más documentos relevantes, como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5. Tabla 4: Efecto de utilizar solo datos de clics para la clasificación de documentos. El beneficio de la información del historial de consultas y la información de clics es principalmente aditivo, es decir, combinarlos puede lograr un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno por separado, pero la mayor parte de la mejora claramente proviene de la información de clics. En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el método BatchUp. Sensibilidad de parámetros. Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parámetros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y Qk, aunque la parametrización es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsección, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parámetros para BatchUp, que parece tener un rendimiento relativamente mejor que otros. BatchUp tiene dos parámetros µ y ν. Primero miramos a µ. Cuando µ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se utiliza en absoluto, y esencialmente solo usamos los datos de clics combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos µ, incorporaremos gradualmente más información de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cómo la precisión promedio de BatchUp cambia a medida que variamos µ con ν fijo en 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp. Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2. El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores. Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando µ está alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la información de consultas anteriores es tan útil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por q2, claramente hay un cierto equilibrio entre la consulta actual y las consultas anteriores.

Ahora pasamos al otro parámetro ν. Cuando ν se establece en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics; cuando ν se establece en +∞, solo usamos el historial de consultas y la consulta actual. Con µ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp, variamos ν y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando ν ≤ 30, con frecuencia el mejor rendimiento se logra en ν = 15. Esto significa que la información combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan útil como aproximadamente 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la información de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que BatchUp no solo tiene un mejor rendimiento que otros métodos, sino que también es bastante robusto. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJOS FUTUROS En este artículo, hemos explorado cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluida la historia de consultas y la historia de clics dentro de la misma sesión de búsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación de información. Usando el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos estadísticos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir ningún esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede ampliar de varias maneras: en primer lugar, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar información de retroalimentación implícita. Sería interesante desarrollar modelos más sofisticados para aprovechar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar de manera diferente un resumen seleccionado dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalización o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. Segundo, los modelos propuestos pueden ser implementados en cualquier sistema práctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de búsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporará algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. También realizaremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la búsqueda web real. Finalmente, deberíamos estudiar más a fondo un marco general de recuperación para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperación de información interactiva y estudiar cómo optimizar algunos de los parámetros en los modelos de recuperación sensibles al contexto. 7.

                "In this paper, we study how to exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve retrieval accuracy in an interactive information retrieval setting.",
                "We propose several contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents.",
                "We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set.",
                "Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
                "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",
                "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
                "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
                "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",
                "The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.",
                "In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models.",
                "In Section 4, we describe how we create the data set for implicit feedback experiments.",
                "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is <br>long-term context</br>, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "<br>long-term context</br> can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some <br>long-term context</br>.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",

Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",

                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",

                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",

                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el <br>contexto a largo plazo</br>, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El <br>contexto a largo plazo</br> puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto <br>contexto a largo plazo</br>. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente haría clic frecuentemente en algunos documentos para verlos. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic. Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación. En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1. También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos. En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos. Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación. Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta. Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk. Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics. Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk). Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto. Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una interpolación de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial. Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ). Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta. Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperación interactivo, la presentamos de una manera más general. En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva). Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimación bayesiana, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la estimación bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior. Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales. Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un proceso interactivo de recuperación utilizando estimación bayesiana. En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0. Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1. Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados. Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado. Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci). Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual. En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto. Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados. En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos. La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia. Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos de TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de texto, porque los datos de AP han sido utilizados en varias tareas de TREC y cuentan con juicios relativamente completos. Hay en total 242918 artículos de noticias y la longitud promedio de los documentos es de 416 palabras. La mayoría de los artículos tienen títulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oración del texto como título. Para el preprocesamiento, solo realizamos la conversión a minúsculas y no eliminamos stopwords ni realizamos stemming. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difíciles de los temas TREC 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisión entre los temas 1-150 de TREC según algunos experimentos de referencia utilizando el modelo de Divergencia de KL con suavizado de priorización bayesiana [20]. La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexamos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de búsqueda e interfaz web para los artículos de noticias de TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para realizar experimentos y recopilar datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asignan 10 temas y se le proporcionan las descripciones de los temas proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el título del tema dado en la descripción original del tema de TREC. Después de que el sujeto envíe la consulta, el motor de búsqueda realizará la recuperación y devolverá una lista clasificada de resultados de búsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto revisará los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o más resultados para leer el texto completo del artículo o artículos. El sujeto también puede modificar la consulta para realizar otra búsqueda. Para cada tema, el sujeto compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el número del tema de un menú de selección antes de enviar la consulta al motor de búsqueda para que podamos detectar fácilmente el límite de la sesión, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones de los usuarios, incluyendo las consultas enviadas y los documentos clicados. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los términos de la consulta y las páginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento clicado, almacenamos el resumen tal como se muestra en la página de resultados de búsqueda. El resumen del artículo es dependiente de la consulta y se calcula en línea utilizando la recuperación de pasajes de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado de prior bayesiano). De entre 120 consultas (4 para cada uno de los 30 temas) que estudiamos en el experimento, la longitud promedio de las consultas es de 3.71 palabras. En total hay 91 documentos clicados para ver. En promedio, hay alrededor de 3 clics por tema.

EXPERIMENTOS 5.1 Diseño del experimento Nuestra hipótesis principal es que el uso del contexto de búsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas y la información de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. En particular, el contexto de búsqueda puede proporcionar información adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un modelo de consulta mejor que simplemente utilizando la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de recuperación utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando así cualquier contexto) con el rendimiento utilizando tanto la consulta actual como el contexto de búsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, realizamos tales comparaciones para cada versión de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) Precisión Promedio Media (MAP): Esta es la precisión promedio estándar no interpolada y sirve como una buena medida de la precisión general de clasificación. (2) Precisión en 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es más significativa que MAP y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los primeros 20 documentos. En todos los casos, la cifra reportada es el promedio de los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de búsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parámetros (α y β para FixInt; µ y ν para los demás). Ten en cuenta que µ y ν pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes métodos. Variamos estos parámetros e identificamos el rendimiento óptimo para cada método. También variamos los parámetros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuración de los parámetros. 5.2 Análisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de búsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento óptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que utilizan solo la consulta actual en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con qi es el rendimiento base y una fila etiquetada con qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento al utilizar el contexto de búsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones a partir de esta tabla: 1. Comparar las actuaciones de referencia indica que, en promedio, las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores, siendo la actuación de q4 la mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan consultas cada vez mejores. El uso del contexto de búsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede observar en el hecho de que la mejora del 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip para q4 y q3 es generalmente más sustancial en comparación con q2. De hecho, en muchos casos con q2, el uso del contexto puede perjudicar el rendimiento, probablemente porque el historial en ese punto es escaso. Cuando el contexto de búsqueda es amplio, la mejora en el rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, BatchUp logra una mejora del 92.4% en la precisión media promedio sobre q3 y del 77.2% sobre q4. (Las precisiones generalmente bajas también hacen que la mejora relativa sea engañosamente alta, sin embargo). 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que utilizan contexto de búsqueda, las actuaciones de FixInt y OnlineUp son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y BatchUp. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que FixInt y la principal diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que el primero utiliza un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolación, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y que una interpolación de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre OnlineUp y BatchUp es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes decaídos para combinar los múltiples resúmenes clicados, mientras que BatchUp simplemente concatena todos los resúmenes clicados. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que OnlineUp indica que los pesos para combinar los resúmenes clicados no deberían estar decayendo. Si bien OnlineUp es teóricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior al de BayesInt y BatchUp, probablemente debido al coeficiente de decaimiento. En general, BatchUp parece ser el mejor método cuando variamos la configuración de los parámetros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de búsqueda: historial de consultas y datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribución de cada tipo de contexto. 5.2.2 Utilizando solo el historial de consultas En cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos de historial de clics configurando los parámetros adecuadamente. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas. Utilizamos la misma configuración de parámetros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Aquí vemos que en general, el beneficio de utilizar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto difiere de lo reportado en un estudio previo [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas resultó ser consistentemente útil. Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4. Esto se debe nuevamente probablemente a que al principio la consulta inicial, que es el título en la descripción original del tema de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta; de hecho, en promedio, el rendimiento de estas consultas de primera generación es claramente inferior al de todas las demás consultas formuladas por los usuarios en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observación es que al utilizar solo el historial de consultas, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, OnlineUp y BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (α = 0.1, β = 0) (µ = 0.2,ν = 0) (µ = 5.0,ν = +∞) (µ = 2.0, ν = +∞) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas para la clasificación de documentos. µ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.0552 0.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: La precisión promedio de BatchUp utilizando solo el historial de consultas es esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan la variación causada por el parámetro µ. Un ajuste más bajo de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor más alto de 5.0. Una imagen más completa de la influencia del ajuste de µ se puede ver en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango más amplio de valores de µ. El valor de µ se puede interpretar como cuántas palabras consideramos que vale la historia de la consulta. Un valor más grande pone más peso en la historia y se considera que afecta más el rendimiento cuando la información histórica no es abundante. Por lo tanto, aunque para q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para µ ∈ [2, 5], solo cuando µ = 0.5 vemos algún pequeño beneficio para q2. Como esperaríamos, un µ excesivamente grande perjudicaría el rendimiento en general, pero q2 es el más perjudicado y q4 apenas se ve afectado, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos más información del historial de consultas, podemos poner más peso en esa información histórica. Esto también sugiere que una estrategia mejor probablemente debería ajustar dinámicamente los parámetros según la cantidad de información histórica que tengamos. Los resultados mixtos del historial de consultas sugieren que el efecto positivo de utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita puede haber provenido en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto tal como discutimos en la siguiente subsección. 5.2.3 Uso solo del historial de clics. Ahora desactivamos el historial de consultas y solo utilizamos los resúmenes clicados junto con la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de utilizar la información de clics es mucho más significativo que el de utilizar el historial de consultas. Observamos un efecto generalmente positivo, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre el punto de partida. También es claro que cuanto más ricos sean los datos del contexto, mayor será la mejora que se puede lograr al utilizar resúmenes seleccionados. Aparte de alguna degradación ocasional de la precisión en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y a menudo bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto resumido seleccionado es generalmente bastante útil para inferir la necesidad de información de un usuario. Intuitivamente, tiene más sentido utilizar el resumen del texto en lugar del contenido real del documento, ya que es bastante posible que el documento detrás de un resumen aparentemente relevante en realidad no lo sea. 29 de los 91 documentos clicados son relevantes. Actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en dichos resúmenes elevaría la clasificación de estos documentos relevantes, lo que provocaría una mejora en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, tal mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuánta mejora hemos logrado en la mejora de los rangos de los documentos relevantes no vistos, excluimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recalculamos el rendimiento de BayesInt y la línea base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Ten en cuenta que el rendimiento del método base es menor debido a la eliminación de los 29 documentos relevantes, los cuales habrían sido generalmente clasificados en los primeros puestos de los resultados. Desde la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resúmenes clicados también ayuda a mejorar significativamente las clasificaciones de documentos relevantes no vistos. La pregunta restante es si los datos de clics siguen siendo útiles si ninguno de los documentos clicados es relevante. Para responder a esta pregunta, extraímos los 29 resúmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto más pequeño de resúmenes clicados HC, y reevaluamos el rendimiento del método BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuración de parámetros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisión promedio mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan solo en 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, es más probable que un usuario haga clic en algunos resúmenes relevantes, lo que ayudaría a mostrar más documentos relevantes, como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5. Tabla 4: Efecto de utilizar solo datos de clics para la clasificación de documentos. El beneficio de la información del historial de consultas y la información de clics es principalmente aditivo, es decir, combinarlos puede lograr un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno por separado, pero la mayor parte de la mejora claramente proviene de la información de clics. En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el método BatchUp. Sensibilidad de parámetros. Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parámetros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y Qk, aunque la parametrización es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsección, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parámetros para BatchUp, que parece tener un rendimiento relativamente mejor que otros. BatchUp tiene dos parámetros µ y ν. Primero miramos a µ. Cuando µ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se utiliza en absoluto, y esencialmente solo usamos los datos de clics combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos µ, incorporaremos gradualmente más información de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cómo la precisión promedio de BatchUp cambia a medida que variamos µ con ν fijo en 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp. Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2. El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores. Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando µ está alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la información de consultas anteriores es tan útil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por q2, claramente hay un cierto equilibrio entre la consulta actual y las consultas anteriores. Consulta MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Mejora 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Mejora 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Mejora 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Mejora 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Mejora 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Mejora 77.2% 16.4% Tabla 7: El beneficio aditivo de la información de contexto y el uso de una combinación equilibrada de ellas logra un mejor rendimiento que usar cada una por separado. Ahora pasamos al otro parámetro ν. Cuando ν se establece en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics; cuando ν se establece en +∞, solo usamos el historial de consultas y la consulta actual. Con µ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp, variamos ν y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando ν ≤ 30, con frecuencia el mejor rendimiento se logra en ν = 15. Esto significa que la información combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan útil como aproximadamente 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la información de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que BatchUp no solo tiene un mejor rendimiento que otros métodos, sino que también es bastante robusto. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJOS FUTUROS En este artículo, hemos explorado cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluida la historia de consultas y la historia de clics dentro de la misma sesión de búsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación de información. Usando el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos estadísticos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir ningún esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede ampliar de varias maneras: en primer lugar, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar información de retroalimentación implícita. Sería interesante desarrollar modelos más sofisticados para aprovechar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar de manera diferente un resumen seleccionado dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalización o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. Segundo, los modelos propuestos pueden ser implementados en cualquier sistema práctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de búsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporará algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. También realizaremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la búsqueda web real. Finalmente, deberíamos estudiar más a fondo un marco general de recuperación para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperación de información interactiva y estudiar cómo optimizar algunos de los parámetros en los modelos de recuperación sensibles al contexto. 7.

                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",

                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
                "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",

                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",

                "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is <br>short-term context</br>, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of <br>short-term context</br>.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, <br>short-term context</br> is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the <br>short-term context</br> in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the <br>short-term context</br>, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other <br>short-term context</br> information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",

                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el <br>contexto a corto plazo</br>, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de <br>contexto a corto plazo</br>. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el <br>contexto a corto plazo</br> es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el <br>contexto a corto plazo</br> para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el <br>contexto a corto plazo</br>, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo.

                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",

                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",

                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",

                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",

                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 <br>fixed coefficient interpolation</br> (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a <br>fixed coefficient interpolation</br> of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",

Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",

                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",

                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",

                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente haría clic frecuentemente en algunos documentos para verlos. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic. Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación. En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1. También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos. En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos. Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación. Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta. Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk. Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics. Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk). Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto. Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 <br>Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo</br> (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una <br>interpolación de coeficiente fijo</br> de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial. Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ). Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta. Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperación interactivo, la presentamos de una manera más general. En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva). Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimación bayesiana, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la estimación bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior. Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales. Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un proceso interactivo de recuperación utilizando estimación bayesiana. En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0. Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1. Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados. Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado. Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci). Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual. En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto. Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados. En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos. La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia. Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos de TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de texto, porque los datos de AP han sido utilizados en varias tareas de TREC y cuentan con juicios relativamente completos. Hay en total 242918 artículos de noticias y la longitud promedio de los documentos es de 416 palabras. La mayoría de los artículos tienen títulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oración del texto como título. Para el preprocesamiento, solo realizamos la conversión a minúsculas y no eliminamos stopwords ni realizamos stemming. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difíciles de los temas TREC 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisión entre los temas 1-150 de TREC según algunos experimentos de referencia utilizando el modelo de Divergencia de KL con suavizado de priorización bayesiana [20]. La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexamos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de búsqueda e interfaz web para los artículos de noticias de TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para realizar experimentos y recopilar datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asignan 10 temas y se le proporcionan las descripciones de los temas proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el título del tema dado en la descripción original del tema de TREC. Después de que el sujeto envíe la consulta, el motor de búsqueda realizará la recuperación y devolverá una lista clasificada de resultados de búsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto revisará los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o más resultados para leer el texto completo del artículo o artículos. El sujeto también puede modificar la consulta para realizar otra búsqueda. Para cada tema, el sujeto compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el número del tema de un menú de selección antes de enviar la consulta al motor de búsqueda para que podamos detectar fácilmente el límite de la sesión, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones de los usuarios, incluyendo las consultas enviadas y los documentos clicados. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los términos de la consulta y las páginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento clicado, almacenamos el resumen tal como se muestra en la página de resultados de búsqueda. El resumen del artículo es dependiente de la consulta y se calcula en línea utilizando la recuperación de pasajes de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado de prior bayesiano). De entre 120 consultas (4 para cada uno de los 30 temas) que estudiamos en el experimento, la longitud promedio de las consultas es de 3.71 palabras. En total hay 91 documentos clicados para ver. En promedio, hay alrededor de 3 clics por tema.

EXPERIMENTOS 5.1 Diseño del experimento Nuestra hipótesis principal es que el uso del contexto de búsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas y la información de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. En particular, el contexto de búsqueda puede proporcionar información adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un modelo de consulta mejor que simplemente utilizando la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de recuperación utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando así cualquier contexto) con el rendimiento utilizando tanto la consulta actual como el contexto de búsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, realizamos tales comparaciones para cada versión de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) Precisión Promedio Media (MAP): Esta es la precisión promedio estándar no interpolada y sirve como una buena medida de la precisión general de clasificación. (2) Precisión en 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es más significativa que MAP y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los primeros 20 documentos. En todos los casos, la cifra reportada es el promedio de los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de búsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parámetros (α y β para FixInt; µ y ν para los demás). Ten en cuenta que µ y ν pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes métodos. Variamos estos parámetros e identificamos el rendimiento óptimo para cada método. También variamos los parámetros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuración de los parámetros. 5.2 Análisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de búsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento óptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que utilizan solo la consulta actual en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con qi es el rendimiento base y una fila etiquetada con qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento al utilizar el contexto de búsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones a partir de esta tabla: 1. Comparar las actuaciones de referencia indica que, en promedio, las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores, siendo la actuación de q4 la mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan consultas cada vez mejores. El uso del contexto de búsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede observar en el hecho de que la mejora del 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip para q4 y q3 es generalmente más sustancial en comparación con q2. De hecho, en muchos casos con q2, el uso del contexto puede perjudicar el rendimiento, probablemente porque el historial en ese punto es escaso. Cuando el contexto de búsqueda es amplio, la mejora en el rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, BatchUp logra una mejora del 92.4% en la precisión media promedio sobre q3 y del 77.2% sobre q4. (Las precisiones generalmente bajas también hacen que la mejora relativa sea engañosamente alta, sin embargo). 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que utilizan contexto de búsqueda, las actuaciones de FixInt y OnlineUp son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y BatchUp. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que FixInt y la principal diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que el primero utiliza un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolación, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y que una interpolación de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre OnlineUp y BatchUp es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes decaídos para combinar los múltiples resúmenes clicados, mientras que BatchUp simplemente concatena todos los resúmenes clicados. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que OnlineUp indica que los pesos para combinar los resúmenes clicados no deberían estar decayendo. Si bien OnlineUp es teóricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior al de BayesInt y BatchUp, probablemente debido al coeficiente de decaimiento. En general, BatchUp parece ser el mejor método cuando variamos la configuración de los parámetros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de búsqueda: historial de consultas y datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribución de cada tipo de contexto. 5.2.2 Utilizando solo el historial de consultas En cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos de historial de clics configurando los parámetros adecuadamente. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas. Utilizamos la misma configuración de parámetros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Aquí vemos que en general, el beneficio de utilizar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto difiere de lo reportado en un estudio previo [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas resultó ser consistentemente útil. Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4. Esto se debe nuevamente probablemente a que al principio la consulta inicial, que es el título en la descripción original del tema de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta; de hecho, en promedio, el rendimiento de estas consultas de primera generación es claramente inferior al de todas las demás consultas formuladas por los usuarios en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observación es que al utilizar solo el historial de consultas, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, OnlineUp y BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (α = 0.1, β = 0) (µ = 0.2,ν = 0) (µ = 5.0,ν = +∞) (µ = 2.0, ν = +∞) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas para la clasificación de documentos. µ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.0552 0.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: La precisión promedio de BatchUp utilizando solo el historial de consultas es esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan la variación causada por el parámetro µ. Un ajuste más bajo de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor más alto de 5.0. Una imagen más completa de la influencia del ajuste de µ se puede ver en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango más amplio de valores de µ. El valor de µ se puede interpretar como cuántas palabras consideramos que vale la historia de la consulta. Un valor más grande pone más peso en la historia y se considera que afecta más el rendimiento cuando la información histórica no es abundante. Por lo tanto, aunque para q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para µ ∈ [2, 5], solo cuando µ = 0.5 vemos algún pequeño beneficio para q2. Como esperaríamos, un µ excesivamente grande perjudicaría el rendimiento en general, pero q2 es el más perjudicado y q4 apenas se ve afectado, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos más información del historial de consultas, podemos poner más peso en esa información histórica. Esto también sugiere que una estrategia mejor probablemente debería ajustar dinámicamente los parámetros según la cantidad de información histórica que tengamos. Los resultados mixtos del historial de consultas sugieren que el efecto positivo de utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita puede haber provenido en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto tal como discutimos en la siguiente subsección. 5.2.3 Uso solo del historial de clics. Ahora desactivamos el historial de consultas y solo utilizamos los resúmenes clicados junto con la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de utilizar la información de clics es mucho más significativo que el de utilizar el historial de consultas. Observamos un efecto generalmente positivo, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre el punto de partida. También es claro que cuanto más ricos sean los datos del contexto, mayor será la mejora que se puede lograr al utilizar resúmenes seleccionados. Aparte de alguna degradación ocasional de la precisión en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y a menudo bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto resumido seleccionado es generalmente bastante útil para inferir la necesidad de información de un usuario. Intuitivamente, tiene más sentido utilizar el resumen del texto en lugar del contenido real del documento, ya que es bastante posible que el documento detrás de un resumen aparentemente relevante en realidad no lo sea. 29 de los 91 documentos clicados son relevantes. Actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en dichos resúmenes elevaría la clasificación de estos documentos relevantes, lo que provocaría una mejora en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, tal mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuánta mejora hemos logrado en la mejora de los rangos de los documentos relevantes no vistos, excluimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recalculamos el rendimiento de BayesInt y la línea base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Ten en cuenta que el rendimiento del método base es menor debido a la eliminación de los 29 documentos relevantes, los cuales habrían sido generalmente clasificados en los primeros puestos de los resultados. Desde la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resúmenes clicados también ayuda a mejorar significativamente las clasificaciones de documentos relevantes no vistos. La pregunta restante es si los datos de clics siguen siendo útiles si ninguno de los documentos clicados es relevante. Para responder a esta pregunta, extraímos los 29 resúmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto más pequeño de resúmenes clicados HC, y reevaluamos el rendimiento del método BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuración de parámetros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisión promedio mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan solo en 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, es más probable que un usuario haga clic en algunos resúmenes relevantes, lo que ayudaría a mostrar más documentos relevantes, como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5. Tabla 4: Efecto de utilizar solo datos de clics para la clasificación de documentos. El beneficio de la información del historial de consultas y la información de clics es principalmente aditivo, es decir, combinarlos puede lograr un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno por separado, pero la mayor parte de la mejora claramente proviene de la información de clics. En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el método BatchUp. Sensibilidad de parámetros. Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parámetros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y Qk, aunque la parametrización es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsección, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parámetros para BatchUp, que parece tener un rendimiento relativamente mejor que otros. BatchUp tiene dos parámetros µ y ν. Primero miramos a µ. Cuando µ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se utiliza en absoluto, y esencialmente solo usamos los datos de clics combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos µ, incorporaremos gradualmente más información de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cómo la precisión promedio de BatchUp cambia a medida que variamos µ con ν fijo en 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp. Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2. El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores. Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando µ está alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la información de consultas anteriores es tan útil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por q2, claramente hay un cierto equilibrio entre la consulta actual y las consultas anteriores. Consulta MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Mejora 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Mejora 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Mejora 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Mejora 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Mejora 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Mejora 77.2% 16.4% Tabla 7: El beneficio aditivo de la información de contexto y el uso de una combinación equilibrada de ellas logra un mejor rendimiento que usar cada una por separado. Ahora pasamos al otro parámetro ν. Cuando ν se establece en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics; cuando ν se establece en +∞, solo usamos el historial de consultas y la consulta actual. Con µ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp, variamos ν y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando ν ≤ 30, con frecuencia el mejor rendimiento se logra en ν = 15. Esto significa que la información combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan útil como aproximadamente 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la información de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que BatchUp no solo tiene un mejor rendimiento que otros métodos, sino que también es bastante robusto. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJOS FUTUROS En este artículo, hemos explorado cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluida la historia de consultas y la historia de clics dentro de la misma sesión de búsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación de información. Usando el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos estadísticos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir ningún esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede ampliar de varias maneras: en primer lugar, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar información de retroalimentación implícita. Sería interesante desarrollar modelos más sofisticados para aprovechar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar de manera diferente un resumen seleccionado dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalización o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. Segundo, los modelos propuestos pueden ser implementados en cualquier sistema práctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de búsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporará algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. También realizaremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la búsqueda web real. Finalmente, deberíamos estudiar más a fondo un marco general de recuperación para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperación de información interactiva y estudiar cómo optimizar algunos de los parámetros en los modelos de recuperación sensibles al contexto. 7.

                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",

                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",

                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",

                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",

                "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use <br>bayesian estimation</br>, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply <br>bayesian estimation</br> to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using <br>bayesian estimation</br>.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente haría clic frecuentemente en algunos documentos para verlos. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic. Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación. En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1. También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos. En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos. Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación. Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta. Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk. Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics. Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk). Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto. Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una interpolación de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial. Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ). Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta. Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperación interactivo, la presentamos de una manera más general. En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva). Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la <br>estimación bayesiana</br>, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la <br>estimación bayesiana</br> para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior. Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales. Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un proceso interactivo de recuperación utilizando <br>estimación bayesiana</br>. En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0. Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1. Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados. Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado. Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci). Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual. En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto. Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados. En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos. La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia. Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos de TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de texto, porque los datos de AP han sido utilizados en varias tareas de TREC y cuentan con juicios relativamente completos. Hay en total 242918 artículos de noticias y la longitud promedio de los documentos es de 416 palabras. La mayoría de los artículos tienen títulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oración del texto como título. Para el preprocesamiento, solo realizamos la conversión a minúsculas y no eliminamos stopwords ni realizamos stemming. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difíciles de los temas TREC 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisión entre los temas 1-150 de TREC según algunos experimentos de referencia utilizando el modelo de Divergencia de KL con suavizado de priorización bayesiana [20]. La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexamos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de búsqueda e interfaz web para los artículos de noticias de TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para realizar experimentos y recopilar datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asignan 10 temas y se le proporcionan las descripciones de los temas proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el título del tema dado en la descripción original del tema de TREC. Después de que el sujeto envíe la consulta, el motor de búsqueda realizará la recuperación y devolverá una lista clasificada de resultados de búsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto revisará los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o más resultados para leer el texto completo del artículo o artículos. El sujeto también puede modificar la consulta para realizar otra búsqueda. Para cada tema, el sujeto compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el número del tema de un menú de selección antes de enviar la consulta al motor de búsqueda para que podamos detectar fácilmente el límite de la sesión, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones de los usuarios, incluyendo las consultas enviadas y los documentos clicados. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los términos de la consulta y las páginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento clicado, almacenamos el resumen tal como se muestra en la página de resultados de búsqueda. El resumen del artículo es dependiente de la consulta y se calcula en línea utilizando la recuperación de pasajes de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado de prior bayesiano). De entre 120 consultas (4 para cada uno de los 30 temas) que estudiamos en el experimento, la longitud promedio de las consultas es de 3.71 palabras. En total hay 91 documentos clicados para ver. En promedio, hay alrededor de 3 clics por tema.

EXPERIMENTOS 5.1 Diseño del experimento Nuestra hipótesis principal es que el uso del contexto de búsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas y la información de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. En particular, el contexto de búsqueda puede proporcionar información adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un modelo de consulta mejor que simplemente utilizando la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de recuperación utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando así cualquier contexto) con el rendimiento utilizando tanto la consulta actual como el contexto de búsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, realizamos tales comparaciones para cada versión de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) Precisión Promedio Media (MAP): Esta es la precisión promedio estándar no interpolada y sirve como una buena medida de la precisión general de clasificación. (2) Precisión en 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es más significativa que MAP y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los primeros 20 documentos. En todos los casos, la cifra reportada es el promedio de los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de búsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parámetros (α y β para FixInt; µ y ν para los demás). Ten en cuenta que µ y ν pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes métodos. Variamos estos parámetros e identificamos el rendimiento óptimo para cada método. También variamos los parámetros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuración de los parámetros. 5.2 Análisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de búsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento óptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que utilizan solo la consulta actual en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con qi es el rendimiento base y una fila etiquetada con qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento al utilizar el contexto de búsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones a partir de esta tabla: 1. Comparar las actuaciones de referencia indica que, en promedio, las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores, siendo la actuación de q4 la mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan consultas cada vez mejores. El uso del contexto de búsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede observar en el hecho de que la mejora del 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip para q4 y q3 es generalmente más sustancial en comparación con q2. De hecho, en muchos casos con q2, el uso del contexto puede perjudicar el rendimiento, probablemente porque el historial en ese punto es escaso. Cuando el contexto de búsqueda es amplio, la mejora en el rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, BatchUp logra una mejora del 92.4% en la precisión media promedio sobre q3 y del 77.2% sobre q4. (Las precisiones generalmente bajas también hacen que la mejora relativa sea engañosamente alta, sin embargo). 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que utilizan contexto de búsqueda, las actuaciones de FixInt y OnlineUp son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y BatchUp. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que FixInt y la principal diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que el primero utiliza un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolación, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y que una interpolación de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre OnlineUp y BatchUp es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes decaídos para combinar los múltiples resúmenes clicados, mientras que BatchUp simplemente concatena todos los resúmenes clicados. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que OnlineUp indica que los pesos para combinar los resúmenes clicados no deberían estar decayendo. Si bien OnlineUp es teóricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior al de BayesInt y BatchUp, probablemente debido al coeficiente de decaimiento. En general, BatchUp parece ser el mejor método cuando variamos la configuración de los parámetros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de búsqueda: historial de consultas y datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribución de cada tipo de contexto. 5.2.2 Utilizando solo el historial de consultas En cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos de historial de clics configurando los parámetros adecuadamente. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas. Utilizamos la misma configuración de parámetros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Aquí vemos que en general, el beneficio de utilizar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto difiere de lo reportado en un estudio previo [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas resultó ser consistentemente útil. Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4. Esto se debe nuevamente probablemente a que al principio la consulta inicial, que es el título en la descripción original del tema de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta; de hecho, en promedio, el rendimiento de estas consultas de primera generación es claramente inferior al de todas las demás consultas formuladas por los usuarios en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observación es que al utilizar solo el historial de consultas, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, OnlineUp y BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (α = 0.1, β = 0) (µ = 0.2,ν = 0) (µ = 5.0,ν = +∞) (µ = 2.0, ν = +∞) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas para la clasificación de documentos. µ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.0552 0.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: La precisión promedio de BatchUp utilizando solo el historial de consultas es esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan la variación causada por el parámetro µ. Un ajuste más bajo de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor más alto de 5.0. Una imagen más completa de la influencia del ajuste de µ se puede ver en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango más amplio de valores de µ. El valor de µ se puede interpretar como cuántas palabras consideramos que vale la historia de la consulta. Un valor más grande pone más peso en la historia y se considera que afecta más el rendimiento cuando la información histórica no es abundante. Por lo tanto, aunque para q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para µ ∈ [2, 5], solo cuando µ = 0.5 vemos algún pequeño beneficio para q2. Como esperaríamos, un µ excesivamente grande perjudicaría el rendimiento en general, pero q2 es el más perjudicado y q4 apenas se ve afectado, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos más información del historial de consultas, podemos poner más peso en esa información histórica. Esto también sugiere que una estrategia mejor probablemente debería ajustar dinámicamente los parámetros según la cantidad de información histórica que tengamos. Los resultados mixtos del historial de consultas sugieren que el efecto positivo de utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita puede haber provenido en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto tal como discutimos en la siguiente subsección. 5.2.3 Uso solo del historial de clics. Ahora desactivamos el historial de consultas y solo utilizamos los resúmenes clicados junto con la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de utilizar la información de clics es mucho más significativo que el de utilizar el historial de consultas. Observamos un efecto generalmente positivo, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre el punto de partida. También es claro que cuanto más ricos sean los datos del contexto, mayor será la mejora que se puede lograr al utilizar resúmenes seleccionados. Aparte de alguna degradación ocasional de la precisión en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y a menudo bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto resumido seleccionado es generalmente bastante útil para inferir la necesidad de información de un usuario. Intuitivamente, tiene más sentido utilizar el resumen del texto en lugar del contenido real del documento, ya que es bastante posible que el documento detrás de un resumen aparentemente relevante en realidad no lo sea. 29 de los 91 documentos clicados son relevantes. Actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en dichos resúmenes elevaría la clasificación de estos documentos relevantes, lo que provocaría una mejora en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, tal mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuánta mejora hemos logrado en la mejora de los rangos de los documentos relevantes no vistos, excluimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recalculamos el rendimiento de BayesInt y la línea base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Ten en cuenta que el rendimiento del método base es menor debido a la eliminación de los 29 documentos relevantes, los cuales habrían sido generalmente clasificados en los primeros puestos de los resultados. Desde la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resúmenes clicados también ayuda a mejorar significativamente las clasificaciones de documentos relevantes no vistos. La pregunta restante es si los datos de clics siguen siendo útiles si ninguno de los documentos clicados es relevante. Para responder a esta pregunta, extraímos los 29 resúmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto más pequeño de resúmenes clicados HC, y reevaluamos el rendimiento del método BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuración de parámetros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisión promedio mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan solo en 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, es más probable que un usuario haga clic en algunos resúmenes relevantes, lo que ayudaría a mostrar más documentos relevantes, como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5. Tabla 4: Efecto de utilizar solo datos de clics para la clasificación de documentos. El beneficio de la información del historial de consultas y la información de clics es principalmente aditivo, es decir, combinarlos puede lograr un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno por separado, pero la mayor parte de la mejora claramente proviene de la información de clics. En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el método BatchUp. Sensibilidad de parámetros. Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parámetros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y Qk, aunque la parametrización es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsección, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parámetros para BatchUp, que parece tener un rendimiento relativamente mejor que otros. BatchUp tiene dos parámetros µ y ν. Primero miramos a µ. Cuando µ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se utiliza en absoluto, y esencialmente solo usamos los datos de clics combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos µ, incorporaremos gradualmente más información de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cómo la precisión promedio de BatchUp cambia a medida que variamos µ con ν fijo en 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp. Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2. El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores. Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando µ está alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la información de consultas anteriores es tan útil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por q2, claramente hay un cierto equilibrio entre la consulta actual y las consultas anteriores. Consulta MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Mejora 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Mejora 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Mejora 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Mejora 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Mejora 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Mejora 77.2% 16.4% Tabla 7: El beneficio aditivo de la información de contexto y el uso de una combinación equilibrada de ellas logra un mejor rendimiento que usar cada una por separado. Ahora pasamos al otro parámetro ν. Cuando ν se establece en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics; cuando ν se establece en +∞, solo usamos el historial de consultas y la consulta actual. Con µ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp, variamos ν y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando ν ≤ 30, con frecuencia el mejor rendimiento se logra en ν = 15. Esto significa que la información combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan útil como aproximadamente 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la información de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que BatchUp no solo tiene un mejor rendimiento que otros métodos, sino que también es bastante robusto. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJOS FUTUROS En este artículo, hemos explorado cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluida la historia de consultas y la historia de clics dentro de la misma sesión de búsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación de información. Usando el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos estadísticos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir ningún esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede ampliar de varias maneras: en primer lugar, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar información de retroalimentación implícita. Sería interesante desarrollar modelos más sofisticados para aprovechar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar de manera diferente un resumen seleccionado dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalización o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. Segundo, los modelos propuestos pueden ser implementados en cualquier sistema práctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de búsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporará algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. También realizaremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la búsqueda web real. Finalmente, deberíamos estudiar más a fondo un marco general de recuperación para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperación de información interactiva y estudiar cómo optimizar algunos de los parámetros en los modelos de recuperación sensibles al contexto. 7.

                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",

                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",

                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",

                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
                "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",
                "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
                "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",

                "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente haría clic frecuentemente en algunos documentos para verlos. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic. Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación. En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1. También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos. En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos. Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación. Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta. Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk. Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics. Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk). Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto. Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una interpolación de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial. Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ). Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta. Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperación interactivo, la presentamos de una manera más general. En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva). Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimación bayesiana, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la estimación bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior. Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales. Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un proceso interactivo de recuperación utilizando estimación bayesiana. En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0. Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1. Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados. Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado. Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci). Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual. En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto. Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados. En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos. La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia. Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos de TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de texto, porque los datos de AP han sido utilizados en varias tareas de TREC y cuentan con juicios relativamente completos. Hay en total 242918 artículos de noticias y la longitud promedio de los documentos es de 416 palabras. La mayoría de los artículos tienen títulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oración del texto como título. Para el preprocesamiento, solo realizamos la conversión a minúsculas y no eliminamos stopwords ni realizamos stemming. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difíciles de los temas TREC 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisión entre los temas 1-150 de TREC según algunos experimentos de referencia utilizando el modelo de Divergencia de KL con suavizado de priorización bayesiana [20]. La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexamos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de búsqueda e interfaz web para los artículos de noticias de TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para realizar experimentos y recopilar datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asignan 10 temas y se le proporcionan las descripciones de los temas proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el título del tema dado en la descripción original del tema de TREC. Después de que el sujeto envíe la consulta, el motor de búsqueda realizará la recuperación y devolverá una lista clasificada de resultados de búsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto revisará los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o más resultados para leer el texto completo del artículo o artículos. El sujeto también puede modificar la consulta para realizar otra búsqueda. Para cada tema, el sujeto compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el número del tema de un menú de selección antes de enviar la consulta al motor de búsqueda para que podamos detectar fácilmente el límite de la sesión, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones de los usuarios, incluyendo las consultas enviadas y los documentos clicados. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los términos de la consulta y las páginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento clicado, almacenamos el resumen tal como se muestra en la página de resultados de búsqueda. El resumen del artículo es dependiente de la consulta y se calcula en línea utilizando la recuperación de pasajes de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado de prior bayesiano). De entre 120 consultas (4 para cada uno de los 30 temas) que estudiamos en el experimento, la longitud promedio de las consultas es de 3.71 palabras. En total hay 91 documentos clicados para ver. En promedio, hay alrededor de 3 clics por tema.

De los 91 documentos seleccionados, 29 documentos son considerados relevantes según el archivo de juicio de TREC. Este conjunto de datos está disponible públicamente. EXPERIMENTOS 5.1 Diseño del experimento Nuestra hipótesis principal es que el uso del contexto de búsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas y la información de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. En particular, el contexto de búsqueda puede proporcionar información adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un modelo de consulta mejor que simplemente utilizando la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de recuperación utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando así cualquier contexto) con el rendimiento utilizando tanto la consulta actual como el contexto de búsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, realizamos tales comparaciones para cada versión de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) <br>Precisión Promedio Media</br> (MAP): Esta es la precisión promedio estándar no interpolada y sirve como una buena medida de la precisión general de clasificación. (2) Precisión en 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es más significativa que MAP y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los primeros 20 documentos. En todos los casos, la cifra reportada es el promedio de los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de búsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parámetros (α y β para FixInt; µ y ν para los demás). Ten en cuenta que µ y ν pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes métodos. Variamos estos parámetros e identificamos el rendimiento óptimo para cada método. También variamos los parámetros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuración de los parámetros. 5.2 Análisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de búsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento óptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que utilizan solo la consulta actual en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con qi es el rendimiento base y una fila etiquetada con qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento al utilizar el contexto de búsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones a partir de esta tabla: 1. Comparar las actuaciones de referencia indica que, en promedio, las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores, siendo la actuación de q4 la mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan consultas cada vez mejores. El uso del contexto de búsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede observar en el hecho de que la mejora del 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip para q4 y q3 es generalmente más sustancial en comparación con q2. De hecho, en muchos casos con q2, el uso del contexto puede perjudicar el rendimiento, probablemente porque el historial en ese punto es escaso. Cuando el contexto de búsqueda es amplio, la mejora en el rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, BatchUp logra una mejora del 92.4% en la <br>precisión media promedio</br> sobre q3 y del 77.2% sobre q4. (Las precisiones generalmente bajas también hacen que la mejora relativa sea engañosamente alta, sin embargo). 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que utilizan contexto de búsqueda, las actuaciones de FixInt y OnlineUp son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y BatchUp. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que FixInt y la principal diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que el primero utiliza un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolación, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y que una interpolación de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre OnlineUp y BatchUp es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes decaídos para combinar los múltiples resúmenes clicados, mientras que BatchUp simplemente concatena todos los resúmenes clicados. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que OnlineUp indica que los pesos para combinar los resúmenes clicados no deberían estar decayendo. Si bien OnlineUp es teóricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior al de BayesInt y BatchUp, probablemente debido al coeficiente de decaimiento. En general, BatchUp parece ser el mejor método cuando variamos la configuración de los parámetros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de búsqueda: historial de consultas y datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribución de cada tipo de contexto. 5.2.2 Utilizando solo el historial de consultas En cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos de historial de clics configurando los parámetros adecuadamente. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas. Utilizamos la misma configuración de parámetros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Aquí vemos que en general, el beneficio de utilizar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto difiere de lo reportado en un estudio previo [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas resultó ser consistentemente útil. Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4. Esto se debe nuevamente probablemente a que al principio la consulta inicial, que es el título en la descripción original del tema de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta; de hecho, en promedio, el rendimiento de estas consultas de primera generación es claramente inferior al de todas las demás consultas formuladas por los usuarios en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observación es que al utilizar solo el historial de consultas, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, OnlineUp y BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (α = 0.1, β = 0) (µ = 0.2,ν = 0) (µ = 5.0,ν = +∞) (µ = 2.0, ν = +∞) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas para la clasificación de documentos. µ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.0552 0.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: La precisión promedio de BatchUp utilizando solo el historial de consultas es esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan la variación causada por el parámetro µ. Un ajuste más bajo de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor más alto de 5.0. Una imagen más completa de la influencia del ajuste de µ se puede ver en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango más amplio de valores de µ. El valor de µ se puede interpretar como cuántas palabras consideramos que vale la historia de la consulta. Un valor más grande pone más peso en la historia y se considera que afecta más el rendimiento cuando la información histórica no es abundante. Por lo tanto, aunque para q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para µ ∈ [2, 5], solo cuando µ = 0.5 vemos algún pequeño beneficio para q2. Como esperaríamos, un µ excesivamente grande perjudicaría el rendimiento en general, pero q2 es el más perjudicado y q4 apenas se ve afectado, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos más información del historial de consultas, podemos poner más peso en esa información histórica. Esto también sugiere que una estrategia mejor probablemente debería ajustar dinámicamente los parámetros según la cantidad de información histórica que tengamos. Los resultados mixtos del historial de consultas sugieren que el efecto positivo de utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita puede haber provenido en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto tal como discutimos en la siguiente subsección. 5.2.3 Uso solo del historial de clics. Ahora desactivamos el historial de consultas y solo utilizamos los resúmenes clicados junto con la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de utilizar la información de clics es mucho más significativo que el de utilizar el historial de consultas. Observamos un efecto generalmente positivo, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre el punto de partida. También es claro que cuanto más ricos sean los datos del contexto, mayor será la mejora que se puede lograr al utilizar resúmenes seleccionados. Aparte de alguna degradación ocasional de la precisión en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y a menudo bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto resumido seleccionado es generalmente bastante útil para inferir la necesidad de información de un usuario. Intuitivamente, tiene más sentido utilizar el resumen del texto en lugar del contenido real del documento, ya que es bastante posible que el documento detrás de un resumen aparentemente relevante en realidad no lo sea. 29 de los 91 documentos clicados son relevantes. Actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en dichos resúmenes elevaría la clasificación de estos documentos relevantes, lo que provocaría una mejora en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, tal mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuánta mejora hemos logrado en la mejora de los rangos de los documentos relevantes no vistos, excluimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recalculamos el rendimiento de BayesInt y la línea base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Ten en cuenta que el rendimiento del método base es menor debido a la eliminación de los 29 documentos relevantes, los cuales habrían sido generalmente clasificados en los primeros puestos de los resultados. Desde la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resúmenes clicados también ayuda a mejorar significativamente las clasificaciones de documentos relevantes no vistos. La pregunta restante es si los datos de clics siguen siendo útiles si ninguno de los documentos clicados es relevante. Para responder a esta pregunta, extraímos los 29 resúmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto más pequeño de resúmenes clicados HC, y reevaluamos el rendimiento del método BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuración de parámetros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisión promedio mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan solo en 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, es más probable que un usuario haga clic en algunos resúmenes relevantes, lo que ayudaría a mostrar más documentos relevantes, como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5. Tabla 4: Efecto de utilizar solo datos de clics para la clasificación de documentos. El beneficio de la información del historial de consultas y la información de clics es principalmente aditivo, es decir, combinarlos puede lograr un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno por separado, pero la mayor parte de la mejora claramente proviene de la información de clics. En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el método BatchUp. Sensibilidad de parámetros. Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parámetros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y Qk, aunque la parametrización es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsección, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parámetros para BatchUp, que parece tener un rendimiento relativamente mejor que otros. BatchUp tiene dos parámetros µ y ν. Primero miramos a µ. Cuando µ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se utiliza en absoluto, y esencialmente solo usamos los datos de clics combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos µ, incorporaremos gradualmente más información de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cómo la precisión promedio de BatchUp cambia a medida que variamos µ con ν fijo en 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp. Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2. El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores. Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando µ está alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la información de consultas anteriores es tan útil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por q2, claramente hay un cierto equilibrio entre la consulta actual y las consultas anteriores. Consulta MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Mejora 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Mejora 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Mejora 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Mejora 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Mejora 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Mejora 77.2% 16.4% Tabla 7: El beneficio aditivo de la información de contexto y el uso de una combinación equilibrada de ellas logra un mejor rendimiento que usar cada una por separado. Ahora pasamos al otro parámetro ν. Cuando ν se establece en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics; cuando ν se establece en +∞, solo usamos el historial de consultas y la consulta actual. Con µ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp, variamos ν y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando ν ≤ 30, con frecuencia el mejor rendimiento se logra en ν = 15. Esto significa que la información combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan útil como aproximadamente 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la información de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que BatchUp no solo tiene un mejor rendimiento que otros métodos, sino que también es bastante robusto. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJOS FUTUROS En este artículo, hemos explorado cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluida la historia de consultas y la historia de clics dentro de la misma sesión de búsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación de información. Usando el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos estadísticos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir ningún esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede ampliar de varias maneras: en primer lugar, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar información de retroalimentación implícita. Sería interesante desarrollar modelos más sofisticados para aprovechar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar de manera diferente un resumen seleccionado dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalización o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. Segundo, los modelos propuestos pueden ser implementados en cualquier sistema práctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de búsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporará algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. También realizaremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la búsqueda web real. Finalmente, deberíamos estudiar más a fondo un marco general de recuperación para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperación de información interactiva y estudiar cómo optimizar algunos de los parámetros en los modelos de recuperación sensibles al contexto. 7.

                "We propose several contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents.",
                "We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search context information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set.",
                "Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
                "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",
                "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
                "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
                "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",
                "The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.",
                "In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models.",
                "In Section 4, we describe how we create the data set for implicit feedback experiments.",
                "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",

                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente haría clic frecuentemente en algunos documentos para verlos. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic. Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación. En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1. También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos. En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos. Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación. Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta. Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk. Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics. Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk). Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto. Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una interpolación de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial. Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ). Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta. Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperación interactivo, la presentamos de una manera más general. En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva). Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimación bayesiana, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la estimación bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior. Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales. Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un proceso interactivo de recuperación utilizando estimación bayesiana. En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0. Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1. Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados. Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado. Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci). Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual. En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto. Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados. En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos. La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia. Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos de TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de texto, porque los datos de AP han sido utilizados en varias tareas de TREC y cuentan con juicios relativamente completos. Hay en total 242918 artículos de noticias y la longitud promedio de los documentos es de 416 palabras. La mayoría de los artículos tienen títulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oración del texto como título. Para el preprocesamiento, solo realizamos la conversión a minúsculas y no eliminamos stopwords ni realizamos stemming. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difíciles de los temas TREC 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisión entre los temas 1-150 de TREC según algunos experimentos de referencia utilizando el modelo de Divergencia de KL con suavizado de priorización bayesiana [20]. La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexamos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de búsqueda e interfaz web para los artículos de noticias de TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para realizar experimentos y recopilar datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asignan 10 temas y se le proporcionan las descripciones de los temas proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el título del tema dado en la descripción original del tema de TREC. Después de que el sujeto envíe la consulta, el motor de búsqueda realizará la recuperación y devolverá una lista clasificada de resultados de búsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto revisará los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o más resultados para leer el texto completo del artículo o artículos. El sujeto también puede modificar la consulta para realizar otra búsqueda. Para cada tema, el sujeto compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el número del tema de un menú de selección antes de enviar la consulta al motor de búsqueda para que podamos detectar fácilmente el límite de la sesión, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones de los usuarios, incluyendo las consultas enviadas y los documentos clicados. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los términos de la consulta y las páginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento clicado, almacenamos el resumen tal como se muestra en la página de resultados de búsqueda. El resumen del artículo es dependiente de la consulta y se calcula en línea utilizando la recuperación de pasajes de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado de prior bayesiano). De entre 120 consultas (4 para cada uno de los 30 temas) que estudiamos en el experimento, la longitud promedio de las consultas es de 3.71 palabras. En total hay 91 documentos clicados para ver. En promedio, hay alrededor de 3 clics por tema.

De los 91 documentos seleccionados, 29 documentos son considerados relevantes según el archivo de juicio de TREC. Este conjunto de datos está disponible públicamente. EXPERIMENTOS 5.1 Diseño del experimento Nuestra hipótesis principal es que el uso del contexto de búsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas y la información de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. En particular, el contexto de búsqueda puede proporcionar información adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un modelo de consulta mejor que simplemente utilizando la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de recuperación utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando así cualquier contexto) con el rendimiento utilizando tanto la consulta actual como el contexto de búsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, realizamos tales comparaciones para cada versión de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) Precisión Promedio Media (MAP): Esta es la precisión promedio estándar no interpolada y sirve como una buena medida de la precisión general de clasificación. (2) Precisión en 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es más significativa que MAP y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los primeros 20 documentos. En todos los casos, la cifra reportada es el promedio de los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de búsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parámetros (α y β para FixInt; µ y ν para los demás). Ten en cuenta que µ y ν pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes métodos. Variamos estos parámetros e identificamos el rendimiento óptimo para cada método. También variamos los parámetros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuración de los parámetros. 5.2 Análisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de búsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento óptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que utilizan solo la consulta actual en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con qi es el rendimiento base y una fila etiquetada con qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento al utilizar el contexto de búsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones a partir de esta tabla: 1. Comparar las actuaciones de referencia indica que, en promedio, las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores, siendo la actuación de q4 la mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan consultas cada vez mejores. El uso del contexto de búsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede observar en el hecho de que la mejora del 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip para q4 y q3 es generalmente más sustancial en comparación con q2. De hecho, en muchos casos con q2, el uso del contexto puede perjudicar el rendimiento, probablemente porque el historial en ese punto es escaso. Cuando el contexto de búsqueda es amplio, la mejora en el rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, BatchUp logra una mejora del 92.4% en la precisión media promedio sobre q3 y del 77.2% sobre q4. (Las precisiones generalmente bajas también hacen que la mejora relativa sea engañosamente alta, sin embargo). 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que utilizan contexto de búsqueda, las actuaciones de FixInt y OnlineUp son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y BatchUp. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que FixInt y la principal diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que el primero utiliza un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolación, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y que una interpolación de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre OnlineUp y BatchUp es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes decaídos para combinar los múltiples resúmenes clicados, mientras que BatchUp simplemente concatena todos los resúmenes clicados. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que OnlineUp indica que los pesos para combinar los resúmenes clicados no deberían estar decayendo. Si bien OnlineUp es teóricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior al de BayesInt y BatchUp, probablemente debido al coeficiente de decaimiento. En general, BatchUp parece ser el mejor método cuando variamos la configuración de los parámetros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de búsqueda: historial de consultas y datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribución de cada tipo de contexto. 5.2.2 Utilizando solo el historial de consultas En cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos de historial de clics configurando los parámetros adecuadamente. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas. Utilizamos la misma configuración de parámetros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Aquí vemos que en general, el beneficio de utilizar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto difiere de lo reportado en un estudio previo [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas resultó ser consistentemente útil. Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4. Esto se debe nuevamente probablemente a que al principio la consulta inicial, que es el título en la descripción original del tema de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta; de hecho, en promedio, el rendimiento de estas consultas de primera generación es claramente inferior al de todas las demás consultas formuladas por los usuarios en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observación es que al utilizar solo el historial de consultas, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, OnlineUp y BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (α = 0.1, β = 0) (µ = 0.2,ν = 0) (µ = 5.0,ν = +∞) (µ = 2.0, ν = +∞) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas para la clasificación de documentos. µ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.0552 0.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: La precisión promedio de BatchUp utilizando solo el historial de consultas es esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan la variación causada por el parámetro µ. Un ajuste más bajo de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor más alto de 5.0. Una imagen más completa de la influencia del ajuste de µ se puede ver en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango más amplio de valores de µ. El valor de µ se puede interpretar como cuántas palabras consideramos que vale la historia de la consulta. Un valor más grande pone más peso en la historia y se considera que afecta más el rendimiento cuando la información histórica no es abundante. Por lo tanto, aunque para q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para µ ∈ [2, 5], solo cuando µ = 0.5 vemos algún pequeño beneficio para q2. Como esperaríamos, un µ excesivamente grande perjudicaría el rendimiento en general, pero q2 es el más perjudicado y q4 apenas se ve afectado, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos más <br>información del historial de consultas</br>, podemos poner más peso en esa información histórica. Esto también sugiere que una estrategia mejor probablemente debería ajustar dinámicamente los parámetros según la cantidad de información histórica que tengamos. Los resultados mixtos del historial de consultas sugieren que el efecto positivo de utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita puede haber provenido en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto tal como discutimos en la siguiente subsección. 5.2.3 Uso solo del historial de clics. Ahora desactivamos el historial de consultas y solo utilizamos los resúmenes clicados junto con la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de utilizar la información de clics es mucho más significativo que el de utilizar el historial de consultas. Observamos un efecto generalmente positivo, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre el punto de partida. También es claro que cuanto más ricos sean los datos del contexto, mayor será la mejora que se puede lograr al utilizar resúmenes seleccionados. Aparte de alguna degradación ocasional de la precisión en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y a menudo bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto resumido seleccionado es generalmente bastante útil para inferir la necesidad de información de un usuario. Intuitivamente, tiene más sentido utilizar el resumen del texto en lugar del contenido real del documento, ya que es bastante posible que el documento detrás de un resumen aparentemente relevante en realidad no lo sea. 29 de los 91 documentos clicados son relevantes. Actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en dichos resúmenes elevaría la clasificación de estos documentos relevantes, lo que provocaría una mejora en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, tal mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuánta mejora hemos logrado en la mejora de los rangos de los documentos relevantes no vistos, excluimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recalculamos el rendimiento de BayesInt y la línea base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Ten en cuenta que el rendimiento del método base es menor debido a la eliminación de los 29 documentos relevantes, los cuales habrían sido generalmente clasificados en los primeros puestos de los resultados. Desde la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resúmenes clicados también ayuda a mejorar significativamente las clasificaciones de documentos relevantes no vistos. La pregunta restante es si los datos de clics siguen siendo útiles si ninguno de los documentos clicados es relevante. Para responder a esta pregunta, extraímos los 29 resúmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto más pequeño de resúmenes clicados HC, y reevaluamos el rendimiento del método BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuración de parámetros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisión promedio mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan solo en 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, es más probable que un usuario haga clic en algunos resúmenes relevantes, lo que ayudaría a mostrar más documentos relevantes, como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5. Tabla 4: Efecto de utilizar solo datos de clics para la clasificación de documentos. El beneficio de la <br>información del historial de consultas</br> y la información de clics es principalmente aditivo, es decir, combinarlos puede lograr un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno por separado, pero la mayor parte de la mejora claramente proviene de la información de clics. En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el método BatchUp. Sensibilidad de parámetros. Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parámetros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y Qk, aunque la parametrización es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsección, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parámetros para BatchUp, que parece tener un rendimiento relativamente mejor que otros. BatchUp tiene dos parámetros µ y ν. Primero miramos a µ. Cuando µ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se utiliza en absoluto, y esencialmente solo usamos los datos de clics combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos µ, incorporaremos gradualmente más información de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cómo la precisión promedio de BatchUp cambia a medida que variamos µ con ν fijo en 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp. Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2. El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores. Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando µ está alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la información de consultas anteriores es tan útil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por q2, claramente hay un cierto equilibrio entre la consulta actual y las consultas anteriores. Consulta MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Mejora 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Mejora 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Mejora 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Mejora 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Mejora 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Mejora 77.2% 16.4% Tabla 7: El beneficio aditivo de la información de contexto y el uso de una combinación equilibrada de ellas logra un mejor rendimiento que usar cada una por separado. Ahora pasamos al otro parámetro ν. Cuando ν se establece en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics; cuando ν se establece en +∞, solo usamos el historial de consultas y la consulta actual. Con µ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp, variamos ν y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando ν ≤ 30, con frecuencia el mejor rendimiento se logra en ν = 15. Esto significa que la información combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan útil como aproximadamente 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la información de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que BatchUp no solo tiene un mejor rendimiento que otros métodos, sino que también es bastante robusto. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJOS FUTUROS En este artículo, hemos explorado cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluida la historia de consultas y la historia de clics dentro de la misma sesión de búsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación de información. Usando el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos estadísticos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir ningún esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede ampliar de varias maneras: en primer lugar, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar información de retroalimentación implícita. Sería interesante desarrollar modelos más sofisticados para aprovechar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar de manera diferente un resumen seleccionado dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalización o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. Segundo, los modelos propuestos pueden ser implementados en cualquier sistema práctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de búsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporará algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. También realizaremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la búsqueda web real. Finalmente, deberíamos estudiar más a fondo un marco general de recuperación para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperación de información interactiva y estudiar cómo optimizar algunos de los parámetros en los modelos de recuperación sensibles al contexto. 7.

                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",

                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the <br>current query</br> be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the <br>current query</br> Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the <br>current query</br> model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the <br>current query</br> and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our <br>current query</br> Qk is very long, we should trust the <br>current query</br> more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our <br>current query</br> model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a <br>current query</br> model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the <br>current query</br> Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",

                "There are two choices.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la <br>consulta actual</br> para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la <br>consulta actual</br> es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la <br>consulta actual</br> y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la <br>consulta actual</br> Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la <br>consulta actual</br> Qk para realizar la recuperación. ",

                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",

                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",

                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the <br>clickthrough information</br>, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",
                "But the problem is that we have no relevance judgments on such data.",
                "The other choice is to use a TREC data set, which has a text database, topic description and relevance judgment file.",
                "Unfortunately, there are no query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We decide to augment a TREC data set by collecting query history and clickthrough history data.",
                "We select TREC AP88, AP89 and AP90 data as our text database, because AP data has been used in several TREC tasks and has relatively complete judgments.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la <br>información de clics</br>, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la <br>información de clics</br> y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la <br>información de clics</br>. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la <br>información de clics</br>, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la <br>información de clics</br> como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la <br>información de clics anteriores</br> de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo.

                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",

                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
                "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
                "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",

                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.",
                "In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models.",

                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user <br>query history</br> and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a <br>query history</br>, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term <br>query history</br> clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term <br>query history</br> is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the <br>query history</br>, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both <br>query history</br> and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the <br>query history</br> and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the <br>query history</br> HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the <br>query history</br> and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the <br>query history</br> HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the <br>query history</br> HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",

                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the <br>query history</br> Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el <br>historial de consultas</br> de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un <br>historial de consultas</br>, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el <br>historial de consultas</br> a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el <br>historial de consultas</br> a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del <br>historial de consultas</br>, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. ",

                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional context information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, context-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of context that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more context of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",

                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using context includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], context factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new context-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
                "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat context-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search context information.",
                "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
                "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
                "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",

                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of context information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term context, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term context.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term context is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of context is long-term context, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term context can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term context in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term context, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term context.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term context information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific context-sensitive language models to incorporate context information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search context as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a context query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated context query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a context query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",
                "In a typical retrieval system, the retrieval system responds to every new query entered by the user by presenting a ranked list of documents.",
                "In order to rank documents, the system must have some model for the users information need.",
                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",
                "Let p(w|φ) be our current query model and T be a new piece of text evidence observed (e.g., T can be a query or a clicked summary).",
                "To update the query model based on T, we use φ to define a Dirichlet prior parameterized as Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) where µT is the equivalent sample size of the prior.",
                "We use Dirichlet prior because it is a conjugate prior for multinomial distributions.",
                "With such a conjugate prior, the predictive distribution of φ (or equivalently, the mean of the posterior distribution of φ is given by p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) where c(w, T) is the count of w in T and |T| is the length of T. Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",
                "Clearly, we see two types of updating: (1) updating based on a new query Qi; (2) updating based on a new clicked summary Ci.",
                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the context query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",
                "Thus we have the following updating equations: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi where µi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a query, while νi is the equivalent sample size for the prior when updating the model based on a clicked summary.",
                "If we set µi = 0 (or νi = 0) we essentially ignore the prior model, thus would start a completely new query model based on the query Qi (or the clicked summary Ci).",
                "On the other hand, if we set µi = +∞ (or νi = +∞) we essentially ignore the observed query (or the clicked summary) and do not update our model.",
                "Thus the model remains the same as if we do not observe any new text evidence.",
                "In general, the parameters µi and νi may have different values for different i.",
                "For example, at the very beginning, we may have very sparse query history, thus we could use a smaller µi, but later as the query history is richer, we can consider using a larger µi.",
                "But in our experiments, unless otherwise stated, we set them to the same constants, i.e., ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj.",
                "Note that we can take either p(w|φi) or p(w|φi) as our context query model for ranking documents.",
                "This suggests that we do not have to wait until a user enters a new query to initiate a new round of retrieval; instead, as soon as we collect clicked summary Ci, we can update the query model and use p(w|φi) to immediately rerank any documents that a user has not yet seen.",
                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",
                "And to rank documents after seeing the current query Qk, we use p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4.",
                "DATA COLLECTION In order to quantitatively evaluate our models, we need a data set which includes not only a text database and testing topics, but also query history and clickthrough history for each topic.",
                "Since there is no such data set available to us, we have to create one.",
                "There are two choices.",
                "One is to extract topics and any associated query history and clickthrough history for each topic from the log of a retrieval system (e.g., search engine).",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de contexto de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas. Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los resúmenes de documentos clicados, puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de recuperación. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información]: Modelos de recuperación Términos generales Algoritmos 1. En la mayoría de los modelos de recuperación de información existentes, el problema de recuperación se trata como si involucrara una sola consulta y un conjunto de documentos. A partir de una sola consulta, sin embargo, el sistema de recuperación solo puede tener una pista muy limitada sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Un sistema de recuperación óptimo debería intentar aprovechar la mayor cantidad de información de contexto adicional posible para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación, siempre que esté disponible. De hecho, la recuperación sensible al contexto ha sido identificada como un desafío importante en la investigación de la recuperación de información[2]. Hay muchos tipos de contexto que podemos aprovechar. La retroalimentación de relevancia [14] puede considerarse como una forma para que un usuario proporcione más contexto de búsqueda y se sabe que es efectiva para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Sin embargo, la retroalimentación de relevancia requiere que un usuario proporcione explícitamente información de retroalimentación, como especificar la categoría de la necesidad de información o marcar un subconjunto de documentos recuperados como documentos relevantes. Dado que obliga al usuario a participar en actividades adicionales mientras los beneficios no siempre son evidentes para el usuario, a menudo el usuario se muestra reacio a proporcionar esa información de retroalimentación. Por lo tanto, la efectividad de la retroalimentación de relevancia puede estar limitada en aplicaciones reales. Por esta razón, el feedback implícito ha atraído mucha atención recientemente [11, 13, 18, 17, 12]. En general, los resultados de recuperación utilizando la consulta inicial del usuario pueden no ser satisfactorios; a menudo, el usuario tendría que revisar la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación/clasificación [8]. Para una necesidad de información compleja o difícil, el usuario puede necesitar modificar su consulta y ver documentos clasificados con muchas iteraciones antes de que la necesidad de información esté completamente satisfecha. En un escenario de recuperación interactiva, la información naturalmente disponible para el sistema de recuperación es más que solo la consulta actual del usuario y la colección de documentos; en general, todo el historial de interacción puede estar disponible para el sistema de recuperación, incluidas las consultas anteriores, información sobre qué documentos ha elegido ver el usuario e incluso cómo ha leído un documento el usuario (por ejemplo, en qué parte de un documento pasa mucho tiempo leyendo). Definimos la retroalimentación implícita de manera amplia como la explotación de todo el historial de interacción naturalmente disponible para mejorar los resultados de recuperación. Una ventaja importante del feedback implícito es que podemos mejorar la precisión de recuperación sin necesidad de requerir esfuerzo por parte del usuario. Por ejemplo, si la consulta actual es java, sin conocer ninguna información adicional, sería imposible saber si se refiere al lenguaje de programación Java o a la isla de Java en Indonesia. Como resultado, es probable que los documentos recuperados tengan ambos tipos de documentos: algunos pueden ser sobre el lenguaje de programación y otros sobre la isla. Sin embargo, es poco probable que algún usuario en particular esté buscando ambos tipos de documentos. Una ambigüedad como esta puede resolverse explotando la información histórica. Por ejemplo, si sabemos que la consulta anterior del usuario es programación cgi, sugeriría fuertemente que es el lenguaje de programación que el usuario está buscando. El feedback implícito fue estudiado en varios trabajos previos. En [11], Joachims exploró cómo capturar y explotar la información de clics y demostró que dicha información de retroalimentación implícita puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para un grupo de personas. En [18], se realizó un estudio de simulación sobre la efectividad de diferentes algoritmos de retroalimentación implícita, y se propusieron y evaluaron varios modelos de recuperación diseñados para aprovechar la información de clics. En [17], algunos algoritmos de recuperación existentes se adaptan para mejorar los resultados de búsqueda basados en el historial de navegación de un usuario. Otros trabajos relacionados sobre el uso del contexto incluyen la búsqueda personalizada [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], análisis de registros de consultas [5], factores de contexto [12] y consultas implícitas [6]. Si bien el trabajo anterior se ha centrado principalmente en el uso de la información de clics, en este artículo utilizamos tanto la información de clics como las consultas anteriores, y nos enfocamos en desarrollar nuevos modelos de lenguaje sensibles al contexto para la recuperación. Específicamente, desarrollamos modelos para utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita, como la consulta y el historial de clics de la sesión de búsqueda actual, con el fin de mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Utilizamos el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL [19] como base y proponemos tratar la recuperación sensible al contexto como la estimación de un modelo de lenguaje de consulta basado en la consulta actual y cualquier información de contexto de búsqueda. Proponemos varios modelos estadísticos del lenguaje para incorporar el historial de consultas y clics en el modelo de divergencia KL. Un desafío al estudiar modelos de retroalimentación implícita es que no existe ninguna colección de pruebas adecuada para la evaluación. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de retroalimentación implícita, la cual puede ser utilizada para evaluar cuantitativamente modelos de retroalimentación implícita. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer conjunto de pruebas para retroalimentación implícita. Evaluamos los modelos propuestos utilizando este conjunto de datos. Los resultados experimentales muestran que el uso de información de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente los datos de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. Las secciones restantes están organizadas de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, intentamos definir el problema de la retroalimentación implícita e introducir algunos términos que utilizaremos más adelante. En la Sección 3, proponemos varios modelos de retroalimentación implícita basados en modelos estadísticos de lenguaje. En la Sección 4, describimos cómo creamos el conjunto de datos para experimentos de retroalimentación implícita. En la Sección 5, evaluamos diferentes modelos de retroalimentación implícita en el conjunto de datos creado. La sección 6 es nuestras conclusiones y trabajo futuro. 2. DEFINICIÓN DEL PROBLEMA Hay dos tipos de información de contexto que podemos utilizar para obtener retroalimentación implícita. Uno es el contexto a corto plazo, que es la información inmediata que rodea y arroja luz sobre la necesidad de información actual de un usuario en una sola sesión. Una sesión puede ser considerada como un período que consiste en todas las interacciones para la misma necesidad de información. La categoría de la necesidad de información de un usuario (por ejemplo, niños o deportes), consultas anteriores y documentos recientemente vistos son todos ejemplos de contexto a corto plazo. Dicha información está directamente relacionada con la necesidad actual de información del usuario y, por lo tanto, se espera que sea la más útil para mejorar la búsqueda actual. En general, el contexto a corto plazo es más útil para mejorar la búsqueda en la sesión actual, pero puede que no sea tan útil para las actividades de búsqueda en una sesión diferente. El otro tipo de contexto es el contexto a largo plazo, que se refiere a información como el nivel educativo de los usuarios y sus intereses generales, el historial de consultas de los usuarios acumulado y la información de clics anteriores de los usuarios; esta información suele ser estable durante mucho tiempo y se acumula con el tiempo. El contexto a largo plazo puede ser aplicable a todas las sesiones, pero puede no ser tan efectivo como el contexto a corto plazo para mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en una sesión particular. En este artículo, nos enfocamos en el contexto a corto plazo, aunque algunos de nuestros métodos también pueden ser utilizados para incorporar de manera natural cierto contexto a largo plazo. En una sola sesión de búsqueda, un usuario puede interactuar con el sistema de búsqueda varias veces. Durante las interacciones, el usuario modificaría continuamente la consulta. Por lo tanto, para la consulta actual Qk (excepto por la primera consulta de una sesión de búsqueda), existe un historial de consultas, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) asociado con ella, que consiste en las consultas anteriores realizadas por el mismo usuario en la sesión actual. Se debe tener en cuenta que en este artículo asumimos que los límites de las sesiones son conocidos. En la práctica, necesitamos técnicas para descubrir automáticamente los límites de las sesiones, los cuales han sido estudiados en [9, 16]. Tradicionalmente, el sistema de recuperación solo utiliza la consulta actual Qk para realizar la recuperación. Pero el historial de consultas a corto plazo claramente puede proporcionar pistas útiles sobre la necesidad de información actual del usuario, como se ve en el ejemplo de Java dado en la sección anterior. De hecho, nuestro trabajo previo [15] ha demostrado que el historial de consultas a corto plazo es útil para mejorar la precisión de recuperación. Además del historial de consultas, puede haber otra información de contexto a corto plazo disponible. Por ejemplo, un usuario presumiblemente haría clic frecuentemente en algunos documentos para verlos. Nos referimos a los datos asociados con estas acciones como historial de clics. Los datos de clics pueden incluir el título, resumen y posiblemente también el contenido y la ubicación (por ejemplo, la URL) del documento al que se hizo clic. Aunque no está claro si un documento visualizado es realmente relevante para la necesidad de información del usuario, podemos asumir con seguridad que el resumen/título mostrado sobre el documento es atractivo para el usuario, por lo tanto transmite información sobre la necesidad de información del usuario. Supongamos que concatenamos toda la información de texto mostrada sobre un documento (generalmente título y resumen) juntas, también tendremos un resumen clicado Ci en cada ronda de recuperación. En general, podemos tener un historial de resúmenes clicados C1, ..., Ck−1. También aprovecharemos el historial de clics HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) para mejorar la precisión de nuestra búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Trabajos anteriores también han mostrado resultados positivos utilizando información de clics similar [11, 17]. Tanto el historial de consultas como el historial de clics son información de retroalimentación implícita, que existe naturalmente en la recuperación de información interactiva, por lo que no se necesita esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario para recopilarlos. En este artículo, estudiamos cómo explotar dicha información (HQ y HC), desarrollar modelos para incorporar el historial de consultas y el historial de clics en una función de clasificación de recuperación, y evaluar cuantitativamente estos modelos. Los modelos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información contextualmente sensible. Intuitivamente, el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC son útiles para mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda para la consulta actual Qk. Una pregunta de investigación importante es cómo podemos explotar esa información de manera efectiva. Proponemos utilizar modelos de lenguaje estadístico para modelar la necesidad de información de los usuarios y desarrollar cuatro modelos de lenguaje específicos sensibles al contexto para incorporar información de contexto en un modelo básico de recuperación. 3.1 Modelo básico de recuperación Utilizamos el método de divergencia de Kullback-Leibler (KL) [19] como nuestro método básico de recuperación. Según este modelo, la tarea de recuperación implica calcular un modelo de lenguaje de consulta θQ para una consulta dada y un modelo de lenguaje de documento θD para un documento y luego calcular su divergencia KL D(θQ||θD), que sirve como la puntuación del documento. Una ventaja de este enfoque es que podemos incorporar de forma natural el contexto de búsqueda como evidencia adicional para mejorar nuestra estimación del modelo de lenguaje de la consulta. Formalmente, sea HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) el historial de consultas y la consulta actual sea Qk. Sea HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) el historial de clics. Ten en cuenta que Ci es la concatenación de todos los resúmenes de documentos clicados en la i-ésima ronda de recuperación, ya que podemos tratar razonablemente todos estos resúmenes de manera igual. Nuestra tarea es estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto, que denotamos como p(w|θk), basado en la consulta actual Qk, así como en el historial de consultas HQ y el historial de clics HC. Ahora describimos varios modelos de lenguaje diferentes para explotar HQ y HC para estimar p(w|θk). Usaremos c(w, X) para denotar el conteo de la palabra w en el texto X, que podría ser una consulta, un resumen de documentos clicados u otro texto. Usaremos |X| para denotar la longitud del texto X o el número total de palabras en X. 3.2 Interpolación de Coeficiente Fijo (FixInt) Nuestra primera idea es resumir el historial de consultas HQ con un modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HQ) y el historial de clics HC con otro modelo de lenguaje unigrama p(w|HC). Luego interpolamos linealmente estos dos modelos históricos para obtener el modelo histórico p(w|H). Finalmente, interpolamos el modelo de historia p(w|H) con el modelo de consulta actual p(w|Qk). Estos modelos se definen de la siguiente manera. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) donde β ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en cada modelo de historial, y donde α ∈ [0, 1] es un parámetro para controlar el peso en la consulta actual y la información histórica. Si combinamos estas ecuaciones, vemos que p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)]. Es decir, el modelo de consulta de contexto estimado es simplemente una interpolación de coeficiente fijo de tres modelos p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC ). 3.3 Interpolación Bayesiana (BayesInt) Un posible problema con el enfoque FixInt es que los coeficientes, especialmente α, son fijos en todas las consultas. Pero intuitivamente, si nuestra consulta actual Qk es muy larga, deberíamos confiar más en la consulta actual, mientras que si Qk tiene solo una palabra, puede ser beneficioso poner más peso en el historial. Para capturar esta intuición, tratamos p(w|HQ) y p(w|HC) como priors de Dirichlet y Qk como los datos observados para estimar un modelo de consulta de contexto utilizando un estimador bayesiano. El modelo estimado está dado por p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] donde µ es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HQ) y ν es el tamaño de la muestra previa para p(w|HC ). Vemos que la única diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que los coeficientes de interpolación ahora son adaptables a la longitud de la consulta. De hecho, al ver BayesInt como FixInt, vemos que α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , por lo tanto, con µ y ν fijos, tendremos un α dependiente de la consulta. Más adelante demostraremos que un α adaptativo empíricamente funciona mejor que un α fijo. 3.4 Actualización Bayesiana en Línea (OnlineUp) Tanto FixInt como BayesInt resumen la información histórica promediando los modelos de lenguaje de unigrama estimados en base a consultas anteriores o resúmenes clicados. Esto significa que todas las consultas anteriores se tratan por igual, al igual que todos los resúmenes clicados. Sin embargo, a medida que el usuario interactúa con el sistema y adquiere más conocimiento sobre la información en la colección, presumiblemente, las consultas reformuladas mejorarán cada vez más. Por lo tanto, asignar pesos decrecientes a las consultas anteriores para confiar más en una consulta reciente que en una consulta anterior parece ser razonable. Interesantemente, si actualizamos incrementalmente nuestra creencia sobre la necesidad de información de los usuarios después de ver cada consulta, podríamos obtener naturalmente pesos decrecientes en las consultas anteriores. Dado que una estrategia de actualización en línea incremental puede ser utilizada para aprovechar cualquier evidencia en un sistema de recuperación interactivo, la presentamos de una manera más general. En un sistema de recuperación típico, el sistema de recuperación responde a cada nueva consulta ingresada por el usuario presentando una lista clasificada de documentos. Para clasificar documentos, el sistema debe contar con un modelo de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. En el modelo de recuperación de divergencia de KL, esto significa que el sistema debe calcular un modelo de consulta cada vez que un usuario ingresa una consulta (nueva). Una forma fundamentada de actualizar el modelo de consulta es utilizar la estimación bayesiana, la cual discutimos a continuación. 3.4.1 Actualización bayesiana Primero discutimos cómo aplicamos la estimación bayesiana para actualizar un modelo de consulta en general. Sea p(w|φ) nuestro modelo de consulta actual y T sea una nueva pieza de evidencia de texto observada (por ejemplo, T puede ser una consulta o un resumen clicado). Para actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en T, usamos φ para definir un parámetro previo de Dirichlet parametrizado como Dir(µT p(w1|φ), ..., µT p(wN |φ)) donde µT es el tamaño de muestra equivalente del prior. Utilizamos la prior de Dirichlet porque es una prior conjugada para distribuciones multinomiales. Con un prior conjugado como este, la distribución predictiva de φ (o equivalentemente, la media de la distribución posterior de φ) está dada por p(w|φ) = c(w, T) + µT p(w|φ) |T| + µT (1) donde c(w, T) es la cantidad de veces que w aparece en T y |T| es la longitud de T. El parámetro µT indica nuestra confianza en el prior expresada en términos de una muestra de texto equivalente a T. Por ejemplo, µT = 1 indica que la influencia del prior es equivalente a agregar una palabra extra a T. Actualización del modelo de consulta secuencial Ahora discutimos cómo podemos actualizar nuestro modelo de consulta con el tiempo durante un proceso interactivo de recuperación utilizando estimación bayesiana. En general, asumimos que el sistema de recuperación mantiene un modelo de consulta actual φi en todo momento. Tan pronto como obtengamos alguna evidencia de retroalimentación implícita en forma de un fragmento de texto Ti, actualizaremos el modelo de consulta. Inicialmente, antes de ver cualquier consulta de usuario, es posible que ya tengamos cierta información sobre el usuario. Por ejemplo, podemos tener información sobre qué documentos ha visto el usuario en el pasado. Utilizamos dicha información para definir una distribución a priori en el modelo de consulta, que se denota como φ0. Después de observar la primera consulta Q1, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en los nuevos datos observados de Q1. El modelo de consulta actualizado φ1 puede ser utilizado para clasificar documentos en respuesta a Q1. A medida que el usuario visualiza algunos documentos, el texto resumido mostrado para dichos documentos C1 (es decir, resúmenes seleccionados) puede servir como nuevos datos para que actualicemos aún más el modelo de consulta y obtener φ1. Al obtener la segunda consulta Q2 del usuario, podemos actualizar φ1 para obtener un nuevo modelo φ2. En general, podemos repetir este proceso de actualización para actualizar de forma iterativa el modelo de consulta. Claramente, vemos dos tipos de actualización: (1) actualización basada en una nueva consulta Qi; (2) actualización basada en un nuevo resumen clicado Ci. En ambos casos, podemos tratar el modelo actual como una prioridad del modelo de consulta de contexto y tratar la nueva consulta observada o el resumen clicado como datos observados. Así tenemos las siguientes ecuaciones de actualización: p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|φi) = c(w, Ci) + νip(w|φi) |Ci| + νi donde µi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en una consulta, mientras que νi es el tamaño de muestra equivalente para la prior al actualizar el modelo basado en un resumen clicado. Si establecemos µi = 0 (o νi = 0) esencialmente ignoramos el modelo previo, por lo tanto comenzaríamos un modelo de consulta completamente nuevo basado en la consulta Qi (o el resumen clicado Ci). Por otro lado, si establecemos µi = +∞ (o νi = +∞) esencialmente ignoramos la consulta observada (o el resumen clicado) y no actualizamos nuestro modelo. Por lo tanto, el modelo permanece igual como si no observáramos ninguna nueva evidencia textual. En general, los parámetros µi y νi pueden tener valores diferentes para diferentes i. Por ejemplo, al principio, es posible que tengamos un historial de consultas muy escaso, por lo tanto podríamos usar un µi más pequeño, pero más tarde, a medida que el historial de consultas sea más amplio, podríamos considerar usar un µi más grande. Pero en nuestros experimentos, a menos que se indique lo contrario, los establecemos en las mismas constantes, es decir, ∀i, j, µi = µj, νi = νj. Ten en cuenta que podemos tomar tanto p(w|φi) como p(w|φi) como nuestro modelo de consulta de contexto para clasificar documentos. Esto sugiere que no tenemos que esperar a que un usuario ingrese una nueva consulta para iniciar una nueva ronda de recuperación; en su lugar, tan pronto como recolectemos el resumen clickeado Ci, podemos actualizar el modelo de consulta y usar p(w|φi) para volver a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier documento que un usuario aún no haya visto. Para puntuar documentos después de ver la consulta Qk, usamos p(w|φk), es decir, p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Actualización bayesiana por lotes (BatchUp). Si fijamos los parámetros de tamaño de muestra equivalente a una constante fija, el algoritmo OnlineUp introduciría un factor de decaimiento: la interpolación repetida haría que los datos iniciales tuvieran un peso bajo. Esto puede ser apropiado para el historial de consultas, ya que es razonable creer que el usuario mejora cada vez más en la formulación de consultas a medida que pasa el tiempo, pero no es necesariamente apropiado para la información de clics, especialmente porque utilizamos el resumen mostrado en lugar del contenido real de un documento al que se hizo clic. Una forma de evitar aplicar una interpolación en descomposición a los datos de clics es hacer OnlineUp solo para el historial de consultas Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), pero no para los datos de clics C. Primero almacenamos en búfer todos los datos de clics juntos y utilizamos el conjunto completo de datos de clics para actualizar el modelo generado mediante la ejecución de OnlineUp en consultas anteriores. Las ecuaciones de actualización son las siguientes. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi donde µi tiene la misma interpretación que en OnlineUp, pero νi ahora indica en qué medida queremos confiar en los resúmenes clicados. En OnlineUp, establecemos todos los µis y los νis en el mismo valor. Y para clasificar los documentos después de ver la consulta actual Qk, usamos p(w|θk) = p(w|ψk) 4. RECOLECCIÓN DE DATOS Para evaluar cuantitativamente nuestros modelos, necesitamos un conjunto de datos que incluya no solo una base de datos de texto y temas de prueba, sino también el historial de consultas y el historial de clics para cada tema. Dado que no contamos con un conjunto de datos disponible, debemos crear uno. Hay dos opciones. Uno debe extraer temas y cualquier historial de consultas asociado, así como el historial de clics para cada tema del registro de un sistema de recuperación (por ejemplo, un motor de búsqueda). Pero el problema es que no tenemos juicios de relevancia sobre esos datos. La otra opción es utilizar un conjunto de datos TREC, que cuenta con una base de datos de texto, una descripción del tema y un archivo de juicio de relevancia. Lamentablemente, no hay datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Decidimos ampliar un conjunto de datos de TREC recopilando datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. Seleccionamos los datos de TREC AP88, AP89 y AP90 como nuestra base de texto, porque los datos de AP han sido utilizados en varias tareas de TREC y cuentan con juicios relativamente completos. Hay en total 242918 artículos de noticias y la longitud promedio de los documentos es de 416 palabras. La mayoría de los artículos tienen títulos. Si no, seleccionamos la primera oración del texto como título. Para el preprocesamiento, solo realizamos la conversión a minúsculas y no eliminamos stopwords ni realizamos stemming. Seleccionamos 30 temas relativamente difíciles de los temas TREC 1-150. Estos 30 temas tienen el peor rendimiento promedio de precisión entre los temas 1-150 de TREC según algunos experimentos de referencia utilizando el modelo de Divergencia de KL con suavizado de priorización bayesiana [20]. La razón por la que seleccionamos temas difíciles es que el usuario tendría que tener varias interacciones con el sistema de recuperación para obtener resultados satisfactorios, de modo que podemos esperar recopilar un historial de consultas y datos de historial de clics relativamente más ricos del usuario. En aplicaciones reales, también podemos esperar que nuestros modelos sean más útiles para temas difíciles, por lo que nuestra estrategia de recolección de datos refleja bien las aplicaciones del mundo real. Indexamos el conjunto de datos TREC AP y configuramos un motor de búsqueda e interfaz web para los artículos de noticias de TREC AP. Utilizamos 3 sujetos para realizar experimentos y recopilar datos de historial de consultas e historial de clics. A cada sujeto se le asignan 10 temas y se le proporcionan las descripciones de los temas proporcionadas por TREC. Para cada tema, la primera consulta es el título del tema dado en la descripción original del tema de TREC. Después de que el sujeto envíe la consulta, el motor de búsqueda realizará la recuperación y devolverá una lista clasificada de resultados de búsqueda al sujeto. El sujeto revisará los resultados y tal vez haga clic en uno o más resultados para leer el texto completo del artículo o artículos. El sujeto también puede modificar la consulta para realizar otra búsqueda. Para cada tema, el sujeto compone al menos 4 consultas. En nuestro experimento, solo se utilizan las primeras 4 consultas para cada tema. El usuario debe seleccionar el número del tema de un menú de selección antes de enviar la consulta al motor de búsqueda para que podamos detectar fácilmente el límite de la sesión, que no es el foco de nuestro estudio. Utilizamos una base de datos relacional para almacenar las interacciones de los usuarios, incluyendo las consultas enviadas y los documentos clicados. Para cada consulta, almacenamos los términos de la consulta y las páginas de resultados asociadas. Y para cada documento clicado, almacenamos el resumen tal como se muestra en la página de resultados de búsqueda. El resumen del artículo es dependiente de la consulta y se calcula en línea utilizando la recuperación de pasajes de longitud fija (modelo de divergencia KL con suavizado de prior bayesiano). De entre 120 consultas (4 para cada uno de los 30 temas) que estudiamos en el experimento, la longitud promedio de las consultas es de 3.71 palabras. En total hay 91 documentos clicados para ver. En promedio, hay alrededor de 3 clics por tema.

De los 91 documentos seleccionados, 29 documentos son considerados relevantes según el archivo de juicio de TREC. Este conjunto de datos está disponible públicamente. EXPERIMENTOS 5.1 Diseño del experimento Nuestra hipótesis principal es que el uso del contexto de búsqueda (es decir, el historial de consultas y la información de clics) puede ayudar a mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. En particular, el contexto de búsqueda puede proporcionar información adicional para ayudarnos a estimar un modelo de consulta mejor que simplemente utilizando la consulta actual. Por lo tanto, la mayoría de nuestros experimentos implican comparar el rendimiento de recuperación utilizando solo la consulta actual (ignorando así cualquier contexto) con el rendimiento utilizando tanto la consulta actual como el contexto de búsqueda. Dado que recopilamos cuatro versiones de consultas para cada tema, realizamos tales comparaciones para cada versión de consultas. Utilizamos dos medidas de rendimiento: (1) Precisión Promedio Media (MAP): Esta es la precisión promedio estándar no interpolada y sirve como una buena medida de la precisión general de clasificación. (2) Precisión en 20 documentos (pr@20docs): Esta medida no se promedia bien, pero es más significativa que MAP y refleja la utilidad para los usuarios que solo leen los primeros 20 documentos. En todos los casos, la cifra reportada es el promedio de los 30 temas. Evaluamos los cuatro modelos para explotar el contexto de búsqueda (es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp). Cada modelo tiene precisamente dos parámetros (α y β para FixInt; µ y ν para los demás). Ten en cuenta que µ y ν pueden necesitar ser interpretados de manera diferente para diferentes métodos. Variamos estos parámetros e identificamos el rendimiento óptimo para cada método. También variamos los parámetros para estudiar la sensibilidad de nuestros algoritmos a la configuración de los parámetros. 5.2 Análisis de resultados 5.2.1 Efecto general del contexto de búsqueda Comparamos el rendimiento óptimo de cuatro modelos con aquellos que utilizan solo la consulta actual en la Tabla 1. Una fila etiquetada con qi es el rendimiento base y una fila etiquetada con qi + HQ + HC es el rendimiento al utilizar el contexto de búsqueda. Podemos hacer varias observaciones a partir de esta tabla: 1. Comparar las actuaciones de referencia indica que, en promedio, las consultas reformuladas son mejores que las consultas anteriores, siendo la actuación de q4 la mejor. Los usuarios generalmente formulan consultas cada vez mejores. El uso del contexto de búsqueda generalmente tiene un efecto positivo, especialmente cuando el contexto es rico. Esto se puede observar en el hecho de que la mejora del 1 http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/QCHistory.zip para q4 y q3 es generalmente más sustancial en comparación con q2. De hecho, en muchos casos con q2, el uso del contexto puede perjudicar el rendimiento, probablemente porque el historial en ese punto es escaso. Cuando el contexto de búsqueda es amplio, la mejora en el rendimiento puede ser bastante sustancial. Por ejemplo, BatchUp logra una mejora del 92.4% en la precisión media promedio sobre q3 y del 77.2% sobre q4. (Las precisiones generalmente bajas también hacen que la mejora relativa sea engañosamente alta, sin embargo). 3. Entre los cuatro modelos que utilizan contexto de búsqueda, las actuaciones de FixInt y OnlineUp son claramente peores que las de BayesInt y BatchUp. Dado que BayesInt funciona mejor que FixInt y la principal diferencia entre BayesInt y FixInt es que el primero utiliza un coeficiente adaptativo para la interpolación, los resultados sugieren que el uso de un coeficiente adaptativo es bastante beneficioso y que una interpolación de estilo bayesiano tiene sentido. La principal diferencia entre OnlineUp y BatchUp es que OnlineUp utiliza coeficientes decaídos para combinar los múltiples resúmenes clicados, mientras que BatchUp simplemente concatena todos los resúmenes clicados. Por lo tanto, el hecho de que BatchUp sea consistentemente mejor que OnlineUp indica que los pesos para combinar los resúmenes clicados no deberían estar decayendo. Si bien OnlineUp es teóricamente atractivo, su rendimiento es inferior al de BayesInt y BatchUp, probablemente debido al coeficiente de decaimiento. En general, BatchUp parece ser el mejor método cuando variamos la configuración de los parámetros. Tenemos dos tipos diferentes de contexto de búsqueda: historial de consultas y datos de clics. Ahora analizamos la contribución de cada tipo de contexto. 5.2.2 Utilizando solo el historial de consultas En cada uno de los cuatro modelos, podemos desactivar los datos de historial de clics configurando los parámetros adecuadamente. Esto nos permite evaluar el efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas. Utilizamos la misma configuración de parámetros para el historial de consultas que en la Tabla 1. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 2. Aquí vemos que en general, el beneficio de utilizar el historial de consultas es muy limitado con resultados mixtos. Esto difiere de lo reportado en un estudio previo [15], donde el uso del historial de consultas resultó ser consistentemente útil. Otra observación es que los contextos de ejecución funcionan mal en q2, pero generalmente funcionan (ligeramente) mejor que los puntos de referencia para q3 y q4. Esto se debe nuevamente probablemente a que al principio la consulta inicial, que es el título en la descripción original del tema de TREC, puede no ser una buena consulta; de hecho, en promedio, el rendimiento de estas consultas de primera generación es claramente inferior al de todas las demás consultas formuladas por los usuarios en las generaciones posteriores. Otra observación es que al utilizar solo el historial de consultas, el modelo BayesInt parece ser mejor que otros modelos. Dado que se ignoran los datos de clics, OnlineUp y BatchUp FixInt BayesInt OnlineUp BatchUp Query (α = 0.1, β = 0) (µ = 0.2,ν = 0) (µ = 5.0,ν = +∞) (µ = 2.0, ν = +∞) MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0097 0.0317 0.0311 0.1200 0.0213 0.0783 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -68.9% -72.4% -0.3% 4.3% -31.7% -31.9% -8.0% -15.9% q3 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0261 0.0917 0.0451 0.1517 0.0444 0.1333 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora -38.2% -38.2% 7.1% 2.3% 5.5% -10.1% 8.1% -2.2% q4 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 0.0536 0.1933 q4 + HQ 0.0428 0.1467 0.0537 0.1917 0.0550 0.1733 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora -20.1% -24.1% 0.2% -0.8% 3.0% -10.3% 3.0% -0.8% Tabla 2: Efecto de utilizar solo el historial de consultas para la clasificación de documentos. µ 0 0.5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 q2 + HQ MAP 0.0312 0.0313 0.0308 0.0287 0.0257 0.0231 0.0213 0.0194 0.0183 0.0182 0.0164 q3 + HQ MAP 0.0421 0.0442 0.0441 0.0455 0.0457 0.0458 0.0444 0.0439 0.0430 0.0390 0.0335 q4 + HQ MAP 0.0536 0.0546 0.0547 0.0552 0.0544 0.0548 0.0550 0.0541 0.0534 0.0525 0.0513 Tabla 3: La precisión promedio de BatchUp utilizando solo el historial de consultas es esencialmente el mismo algoritmo. Los resultados mostrados reflejan la variación causada por el parámetro µ. Un ajuste más bajo de 2.0 se ve mejor que un valor más alto de 5.0. Una imagen más completa de la influencia del ajuste de µ se puede ver en la Tabla 3, donde mostramos las cifras de rendimiento para un rango más amplio de valores de µ. El valor de µ se puede interpretar como cuántas palabras consideramos que vale la historia de la consulta. Un valor más grande pone más peso en la historia y se considera que afecta más el rendimiento cuando la información histórica no es abundante. Por lo tanto, aunque para q4 el mejor rendimiento tiende a lograrse para µ ∈ [2, 5], solo cuando µ = 0.5 vemos algún pequeño beneficio para q2. Como esperaríamos, un µ excesivamente grande perjudicaría el rendimiento en general, pero q2 es el más perjudicado y q4 apenas se ve afectado, lo que indica que a medida que acumulamos más información del historial de consultas, podemos poner más peso en esa información histórica. Esto también sugiere que una estrategia mejor probablemente debería ajustar dinámicamente los parámetros según la cantidad de información histórica que tengamos. Los resultados mixtos del historial de consultas sugieren que el efecto positivo de utilizar información de retroalimentación implícita puede haber provenido en gran medida del uso del historial de clics, lo cual es cierto tal como discutimos en la siguiente subsección. 5.2.3 Uso solo del historial de clics. Ahora desactivamos el historial de consultas y solo utilizamos los resúmenes clicados junto con la consulta actual. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 4. Vemos que el beneficio de utilizar la información de clics es mucho más significativo que el de utilizar el historial de consultas. Observamos un efecto generalmente positivo, a menudo con una mejora significativa sobre el punto de partida. También es claro que cuanto más ricos sean los datos del contexto, mayor será la mejora que se puede lograr al utilizar resúmenes seleccionados. Aparte de alguna degradación ocasional de la precisión en 20 documentos, la mejora es bastante consistente y a menudo bastante sustancial. Estos resultados muestran que el texto resumido seleccionado es generalmente bastante útil para inferir la necesidad de información de un usuario. Intuitivamente, tiene más sentido utilizar el resumen del texto en lugar del contenido real del documento, ya que es bastante posible que el documento detrás de un resumen aparentemente relevante en realidad no lo sea. 29 de los 91 documentos clicados son relevantes. Actualizar el modelo de consulta basado en dichos resúmenes elevaría la clasificación de estos documentos relevantes, lo que provocaría una mejora en el rendimiento. Sin embargo, tal mejora realmente no es beneficiosa para el usuario, ya que el usuario ya ha visto estos documentos relevantes. Para ver cuánta mejora hemos logrado en la mejora de los rangos de los documentos relevantes no vistos, excluimos estos 29 documentos relevantes de nuestro archivo de juicio y recalculamos el rendimiento de BayesInt y la línea base utilizando el nuevo archivo de juicio. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 5. Ten en cuenta que el rendimiento del método base es menor debido a la eliminación de los 29 documentos relevantes, los cuales habrían sido generalmente clasificados en los primeros puestos de los resultados. Desde la Tabla 5, vemos claramente que el uso de resúmenes clicados también ayuda a mejorar significativamente las clasificaciones de documentos relevantes no vistos. La pregunta restante es si los datos de clics siguen siendo útiles si ninguno de los documentos clicados es relevante. Para responder a esta pregunta, extraímos los 29 resúmenes relevantes de nuestros datos de historial de clics HC para obtener un conjunto más pequeño de resúmenes clicados HC, y reevaluamos el rendimiento del método BayesInt utilizando HC con la misma configuración de parámetros que en la Tabla 4. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 6. Vemos que aunque la mejora no es tan sustancial como en la Tabla 4, la precisión promedio mejora en todas las generaciones de consultas. Estos resultados deben interpretarse como muy alentadores, ya que se basan solo en 62 clics no relevantes. En realidad, es más probable que un usuario haga clic en algunos resúmenes relevantes, lo que ayudaría a mostrar más documentos relevantes, como hemos visto en la Tabla 4 y la Tabla 5. Tabla 4: Efecto de utilizar solo datos de clics para la clasificación de documentos. El beneficio de la información del historial de consultas y la información de clics es principalmente aditivo, es decir, combinarlos puede lograr un mejor rendimiento que usar cada uno por separado, pero la mayor parte de la mejora claramente proviene de la información de clics. En la Tabla 7, mostramos este efecto para el método BatchUp. Sensibilidad de parámetros. Los cuatro modelos tienen dos parámetros para controlar los pesos relativos de HQ, HC y Qk, aunque la parametrización es diferente de un modelo a otro. En esta subsección, estudiamos la sensibilidad de los parámetros para BatchUp, que parece tener un rendimiento relativamente mejor que otros. BatchUp tiene dos parámetros µ y ν. Primero miramos a µ. Cuando µ se establece en 0, el historial de consultas no se utiliza en absoluto, y esencialmente solo usamos los datos de clics combinados con la consulta actual. Si aumentamos µ, incorporaremos gradualmente más información de las consultas anteriores. En la Tabla 8, mostramos cómo la precisión promedio de BatchUp cambia a medida que variamos µ con ν fijo en 15.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp. Observamos que el rendimiento es principalmente insensible al cambio de µ para q3 y q4, pero disminuye a medida que µ aumenta para q2. El patrón también es similar cuando establecemos ν en otros valores. Además del hecho de que q1 suele ser peor que q2, q3 y q4, otra posible razón por la que la sensibilidad es menor para q3 y q4 puede ser que generalmente tengamos más datos de clics disponibles para q3 y q4 que para q2, y la influencia dominante de los datos de clics ha hecho que las pequeñas diferencias causadas por µ sean menos visibles para q3 y q4. El mejor rendimiento generalmente se logra cuando µ está alrededor de 2.0, lo que significa que la información de consultas anteriores es tan útil como aproximadamente 2 palabras en la consulta actual. Excepto por q2, claramente hay un cierto equilibrio entre la consulta actual y las consultas anteriores. Consulta MAP pr@20docs q2 0.0312 0.1150 q2 + HQ 0.0287 0.0967 Mejora -8.0% -15.9% q2 + HC 0.0344 0.1167 Mejora 10.3% 1.5% q2 + HQ + HC 0.0342 0.1100 Mejora 9.6% -4.3% q3 0.0421 0.1483 q3 + HQ 0.0455 0.1450 Mejora 8.1% -2.2% q3 + HC 0.0513 0.1650 Mejora 21.9% 11.3% q3 + HQ + HC 0.0810 0.2067 Mejora 92.4% 39.4% q4 0.0536 0.1930 q4 + HQ 0.0552 0.1917 Mejora 3.0% -0.8% q4 + HC 0.0623 0.2050 Mejora 16.2% 6.1% q4 + HQ + HC 0.0950 0.2250 Mejora 77.2% 16.4% Tabla 7: El beneficio aditivo de la información de contexto y el uso de una combinación equilibrada de ellas logra un mejor rendimiento que usar cada una por separado. Ahora pasamos al otro parámetro ν. Cuando ν se establece en 0, solo usamos los datos de clics; cuando ν se establece en +∞, solo usamos el historial de consultas y la consulta actual. Con µ establecido en 2.0, donde se logra el mejor rendimiento de BatchUp, variamos ν y mostramos los resultados en la Tabla 9. Vemos que el rendimiento tampoco es muy sensible cuando ν ≤ 30, con frecuencia el mejor rendimiento se logra en ν = 15. Esto significa que la información combinada del historial de consultas y la consulta actual es tan útil como aproximadamente 15 palabras en los datos de clics, lo que indica que la información de clics es muy valiosa. En general, estos resultados de sensibilidad muestran que BatchUp no solo tiene un mejor rendimiento que otros métodos, sino que también es bastante robusto. 6. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJOS FUTUROS En este artículo, hemos explorado cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluida la historia de consultas y la historia de clics dentro de la misma sesión de búsqueda, para mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperación de información. Usando el modelo de recuperación de divergencia KL como base, propusimos y estudiamos cuatro modelos estadísticos de lenguaje para la recuperación de información sensible al contexto, es decir, FixInt, BayesInt, OnlineUp y BatchUp.

Los resultados del experimento muestran que el uso de retroalimentación implícita, especialmente el historial de clics, puede mejorar sustancialmente el rendimiento de recuperación sin requerir ningún esfuerzo adicional por parte del usuario. El trabajo actual se puede ampliar de varias maneras: en primer lugar, solo hemos explorado algunos modelos de lenguaje muy simples para incorporar información de retroalimentación implícita. Sería interesante desarrollar modelos más sofisticados para aprovechar mejor el historial de consultas y el historial de clics. Por ejemplo, podemos tratar de manera diferente un resumen seleccionado dependiendo de si la consulta actual es una generalización o refinamiento de la consulta anterior. Segundo, los modelos propuestos pueden ser implementados en cualquier sistema práctico. Actualmente estamos desarrollando un agente de búsqueda personalizado del lado del cliente, que incorporará algunos de los algoritmos propuestos. También realizaremos un estudio de usuario para evaluar la efectividad de estos modelos en la búsqueda web real. Finalmente, deberíamos estudiar más a fondo un marco general de recuperación para la toma de decisiones secuenciales en la recuperación de información interactiva y estudiar cómo optimizar algunos de los parámetros en los modelos de recuperación sensibles al contexto. 7.

                "In this paper, we study how to exploit implicit feedback information, including previous queries and clickthrough information, to improve retrieval accuracy in an interactive information retrieval setting.",
                "We propose several contextsensitive retrieval algorithms based on statistical language models to combine the preceding queries and clicked document summaries with the current query for better ranking of documents.",
                "We use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with search <br>context</br> information, and quantitatively evaluate our models using this test set.",
                "Experiment results show that using implicit feedback, especially the clicked document summaries, can improve retrieval performance substantially.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models General Terms Algorithms 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION In most existing information retrieval models, the retrieval problem is treated as involving one single query and a set of documents.",
                "From a single query, however, the retrieval system can only have very limited clue about the users information need.",
                "An optimal retrieval system thus should try to exploit as much additional <br>context</br> information as possible to improve retrieval accuracy, whenever it is available.",
                "Indeed, <br>context</br>-sensitive retrieval has been identified as a major challenge in information retrieval research[2].",
                "There are many kinds of <br>context</br> that we can exploit.",
                "Relevance feedback [14] can be considered as a way for a user to provide more <br>context</br> of search and is known to be effective for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "However, relevance feedback requires that a user explicitly provides feedback information, such as specifying the category of the information need or marking a subset of retrieved documents as relevant documents.",
                "Since it forces the user to engage additional activities while the benefits are not always obvious to the user, a user is often reluctant to provide such feedback information.",
                "Thus the effectiveness of relevance feedback may be limited in real applications.",
                "For this reason, implicit feedback has attracted much attention recently [11, 13, 18, 17, 12].",
                "In general, the retrieval results using the users initial query may not be satisfactory; often, the user would need to revise the query to improve the retrieval/ranking accuracy [8].",
                "For a complex or difficult information need, the user may need to modify his/her query and view ranked documents with many iterations before the information need is completely satisfied.",
                "In such an interactive retrieval scenario, the information naturally available to the retrieval system is more than just the current user query and the document collection - in general, all the interaction history can be available to the retrieval system, including past queries, information about which documents the user has chosen to view, and even how a user has read a document (e.g., which part of a document the user spends a lot of time in reading).",
                "We define implicit feedback broadly as exploiting all such naturally available interaction history to improve retrieval results.",
                "A major advantage of implicit feedback is that we can improve the retrieval accuracy without requiring any user effort.",
                "For example, if the current query is java, without knowing any extra information, it would be impossible to know whether it is intended to mean the Java programming language or the Java island in Indonesia.",
                "As a result, the retrieved documents will likely have both kinds of documents - some may be about the programming language and some may be about the island.",
                "However, any particular user is unlikely searching for both types of documents.",
                "Such an ambiguity can be resolved by exploiting history information.",
                "For example, if we know that the previous query from the user is cgi programming, it would strongly suggest that it is the programming language that the user is searching for.",
                "Implicit feedback was studied in several previous works.",
                "In [11], Joachims explored how to capture and exploit the clickthrough information and demonstrated that such implicit feedback information can indeed improve the search accuracy for a group of people.",
                "In [18], a simulation study of the effectiveness of different implicit feedback algorithms was conducted, and several retrieval models designed for exploiting clickthrough information were proposed and evaluated.",
                "In [17], some existing retrieval algorithms are adapted to improve search results based on the browsing history of a user.",
                "Other related work on using <br>context</br> includes personalized search [1, 3, 4, 7, 10], query log analysis [5], <br>context</br> factors [12], and implicit queries [6].",
                "While the previous work has mostly focused on using clickthrough information, in this paper, we use both clickthrough information and preceding queries, and focus on developing new <br>context</br>-sensitive language models for retrieval.",
                "Specifically, we develop models for using implicit feedback information such as query and clickthrough history of the current search session to improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "We use the KL-divergence retrieval model [19] as the basis and propose to treat <br>context</br>-sensitive retrieval as estimating a query language model based on the current query and any search <br>context</br> information.",
                "We propose several statistical language models to incorporate query and clickthrough history into the KL-divergence model.",
                "One challenge in studying implicit feedback models is that there does not exist any suitable test collection for evaluation.",
                "We thus use the TREC AP data to create a test collection with implicit feedback information, which can be used to quantitatively evaluate implicit feedback models.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first test set for implicit feedback.",
                "We evaluate the proposed models using this data set.",
                "The experimental results show that using implicit feedback information, especially the clickthrough data, can substantially improve retrieval performance without requiring additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we attempt to define the problem of implicit feedback and introduce some terms that we will use later.",
                "In Section 3, we propose several implicit feedback models based on statistical language models.",
                "In Section 4, we describe how we create the data set for implicit feedback experiments.",
                "In Section 5, we evaluate different implicit feedback models on the created data set.",
                "Section 6 is our conclusions and future work. 2.",
                "PROBLEM DEFINITION There are two kinds of <br>context</br> information we can use for implicit feedback.",
                "One is short-term <br>context</br>, which is the immediate surrounding information which throws light on a users current information need in a single session.",
                "A session can be considered as a period consisting of all interactions for the same information need.",
                "The category of a users information need (e.g., kids or sports), previous queries, and recently viewed documents are all examples of short-term <br>context</br>.",
                "Such information is most directly related to the current information need of the user and thus can be expected to be most useful for improving the current search.",
                "In general, short-term <br>context</br> is most useful for improving search in the current session, but may not be so helpful for search activities in a different session.",
                "The other kind of <br>context</br> is long-term <br>context</br>, which refers to information such as a users education level and general interest, accumulated user query history and past user clickthrough information; such information is generally stable for a long time and is often accumulated over time.",
                "Long-term <br>context</br> can be applicable to all sessions, but may not be as effective as the short-term <br>context</br> in improving search accuracy for a particular session.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the short-term <br>context</br>, though some of our methods can also be used to naturally incorporate some long-term <br>context</br>.",
                "In a single search session, a user may interact with the search system several times.",
                "During interactions, the user would continuously modify the query.",
                "Therefore for the current query Qk (except for the first query of a search session) , there is a query history, HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) associated with it, which consists of the preceding queries given by the same user in the current session.",
                "Note that we assume that the session boundaries are known in this paper.",
                "In practice, we need techniques to automatically discover session boundaries, which have been studied in [9, 16].",
                "Traditionally, the retrieval system only uses the current query Qk to do retrieval.",
                "But the short-term query history clearly may provide useful clues about the users current information need as seen in the java example given in the previous section.",
                "Indeed, our previous work [15] has shown that the short-term query history is useful for improving retrieval accuracy.",
                "In addition to the query history, there may be other short-term <br>context</br> information available.",
                "For example, a user would presumably frequently click some documents to view.",
                "We refer to data associated with these actions as clickthrough history.",
                "The clickthrough data may include the title, summary, and perhaps also the content and location (e.g., the URL) of the clicked document.",
                "Although it is not clear whether a viewed document is actually relevant to the users information need, we may safely assume that the displayed summary/title information about the document is attractive to the user, thus conveys information about the users information need.",
                "Suppose we concatenate all the displayed text information about a document (usually title and summary) together, we will also have a clicked summary Ci in each round of retrieval.",
                "In general, we may have a history of clicked summaries C1, ..., Ck−1.",
                "We will also exploit such clickthrough history HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) to improve our search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "Previous work has also shown positive results using similar clickthrough information [11, 17].",
                "Both query history and clickthrough history are implicit feedback information, which naturally exists in interactive information retrieval, thus no additional user effort is needed to collect them.",
                "In this paper, we study how to exploit such information (HQ and HC ), develop models to incorporate the query history and clickthrough history into a retrieval ranking function, and quantitatively evaluate these models. 3.",
                "LANGUAGE MODELS FOR CONTEXTSENSITIVEINFORMATIONRETRIEVAL Intuitively, the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC are both useful for improving search accuracy for the current query Qk.",
                "An important research question is how we can exploit such information effectively.",
                "We propose to use statistical language models to model a users information need and develop four specific <br>context</br>-sensitive language models to incorporate <br>context</br> information into a basic retrieval model. 3.1 Basic retrieval model We use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method [19] as our basic retrieval method.",
                "According to this model, the retrieval task involves computing a query language model θQ for a given query and a document language model θD for a document and then computing their KL divergence D(θQ||θD), which serves as the score of the document.",
                "One advantage of this approach is that we can naturally incorporate the search <br>context</br> as additional evidence to improve our estimate of the query language model.",
                "Formally, let HQ = (Q1, ..., Qk−1) be the query history and the current query be Qk.",
                "Let HC = (C1, ..., Ck−1) be the clickthrough history.",
                "Note that Ci is the concatenation of all clicked documents summaries in the i-th round of retrieval since we may reasonably treat all these summaries equally.",
                "Our task is to estimate a <br>context</br> query model, which we denote by p(w|θk), based on the current query Qk, as well as the query history HQ and clickthrough history HC .",
                "We now describe several different language models for exploiting HQ and HC to estimate p(w|θk).",
                "We will use c(w, X) to denote the count of word w in text X, which could be either a query or a clicked documents summary or any other text.",
                "We will use |X| to denote the length of text X or the total number of words in X. 3.2 Fixed Coefficient Interpolation (FixInt) Our first idea is to summarize the query history HQ with a unigram language model p(w|HQ) and the clickthrough history HC with another unigram language model p(w|HC ).",
                "Then we linearly interpolate these two history models to obtain the history model p(w|H).",
                "Finally, we interpolate the history model p(w|H) with the current query model p(w|Qk).",
                "These models are defined as follows. p(w|Qi) = c(w, Qi) |Qi| p(w|HQ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Qi) p(w|Ci) = c(w, Ci) |Ci| p(w|HC ) = 1 k − 1 i=k−1 i=1 p(w|Ci) p(w|H) = βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ) p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)p(w|H) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on each history model, and where α ∈ [0, 1] is a parameter to control the weight on the current query and the history information.",
                "If we combine these equations, we see that p(w|θk) = αp(w|Qk) + (1 − α)[βp(w|HC ) + (1 − β)p(w|HQ)] That is, the estimated <br>context</br> query model is just a fixed coefficient interpolation of three models p(w|Qk), p(w|HQ), and p(w|HC ). 3.3 Bayesian Interpolation (BayesInt) One possible problem with the FixInt approach is that the coefficients, especially α, are fixed across all the queries.",
                "But intuitively, if our current query Qk is very long, we should trust the current query more, whereas if Qk has just one word, it may be beneficial to put more weight on the history.",
                "To capture this intuition, we treat p(w|HQ) and p(w|HC ) as Dirichlet priors and Qk as the observed data to estimate a <br>context</br> query model using Bayesian estimator.",
                "The estimated model is given by p(w|θk) = c(w, Qk) + µp(w|HQ) + νp(w|HC ) |Qk| + µ + ν = |Qk| |Qk| + µ + ν p(w|Qk)+ µ + ν |Qk| + µ + ν [ µ µ + ν p(w|HQ)+ ν µ + ν p(w|HC )] where µ is the prior sample size for p(w|HQ) and ν is the prior sample size for p(w|HC ).",
                "We see that the only difference between BayesInt and FixInt is the interpolation coefficients are now adaptive to the query length.",
                "Indeed, when viewing BayesInt as FixInt, we see that α = |Qk| |Qk|+µ+ν , β = ν ν+µ , thus with fixed µ and ν, we will have a query-dependent α.",
                "Later we will show that such an adaptive α empirically performs better than a fixed α. 3.4 Online Bayesian Updating (OnlineUp) Both FixInt and BayesInt summarize the history information by averaging the unigram language models estimated based on previous queries or clicked summaries.",
                "This means that all previous queries are treated equally and so are all clicked summaries.",
                "However, as the user interacts with the system and acquires more knowledge about the information in the collection, presumably, the reformulated queries will become better and better.",
                "Thus assigning decaying weights to the previous queries so as to trust a recent query more than an earlier query appears to be reasonable.",
                "Interestingly, if we incrementally update our belief about the users information need after seeing each query, we could naturally obtain decaying weights on the previous queries.",
                "Since such an incremental online updating strategy can be used to exploit any evidence in an interactive retrieval system, we present it in a more general way.",

                "In the KL divergence retrieval model, this means that the system must compute a query model whenever a user enters a (new) query.",
                "A principled way of updating the query model is to use Bayesian estimation, which we discuss below. 3.4.1 Bayesian updating We first discuss how we apply Bayesian estimation to update a query model in general.",

Parameter µT indicates our confidence in the prior expressed in terms of an equivalent text sample comparable with T. For example, µT = 1 indicates that the influence of the prior is equivalent to adding one extra word to T. 3.4.2 Sequential query model updating We now discuss how we can update our query model over time during an interactive retrieval process using Bayesian estimation.",
                "In general, we assume that the retrieval system maintains a current query model φi at any moment.",
                "As soon as we obtain some implicit feedback evidence in the form of a piece of text Ti, we will update the query model.",
                "Initially, before we see any user query, we may already have some information about the user.",
                "For example, we may have some information about what documents the user has viewed in the past.",
                "We use such information to define a prior on the query model, which is denoted by φ0.",
                "After we observe the first query Q1, we can update the query model based on the new observed data Q1.",
                "The updated query model φ1 can then be used for ranking documents in response to Q1.",
                "As the user views some documents, the displayed summary text for such documents C1 (i.e., clicked summaries) can serve as some new data for us to further update the query model to obtain φ1.",
                "As we obtain the second query Q2 from the user, we can update φ1 to obtain a new model φ2.",
                "In general, we may repeat such an updating process to iteratively update the query model.",

                "In both cases, we can treat the current model as a prior of the <br>context</br> query model and treat the new observed query or clicked summary as observed data.",

                "To score documents after seeing query Qk, we use p(w|φk), i.e., p(w|θk) = p(w|φk) 3.5 Batch Bayesian updating (BatchUp) If we set the equivalent sample size parameters to fixed constant, the OnlineUp algorithm would introduce a decaying factor - repeated interpolation would cause the early data to have a low weight.",
                "This may be appropriate for the query history as it is reasonable to believe that the user becomes better and better at query formulation as time goes on, but it is not necessarily appropriate for the clickthrough information, especially because we use the displayed summary, rather than the actual content of a clicked document.",
                "One way to avoid applying a decaying interpolation to the clickthrough data is to do OnlineUp only for the query history Q = (Q1, ..., Qi−1), but not for the clickthrough data C. We first buffer all the clickthrough data together and use the whole chunk of clickthrough data to update the model generated through running OnlineUp on previous queries.",
                "The updating equations are as follows. p(w|φi) = c(w, Qi) + µip(w|φi−1) |Qi| + µi p(w|ψi) = i−1 j=1 c(w, Cj) + νip(w|φi) i−1 j=1 |Cj| + νi where µi has the same interpretation as in OnlineUp, but νi now indicates to what extent we want to trust the clicked summaries.",
                "As in OnlineUp, we set all µis and νis to the same value.",

En este artículo, estudiamos cómo aprovechar la información de retroalimentación implícita, incluidas las consultas anteriores y la información de clics, para mejorar la precisión de recuperación en un entorno de recuperación de información interactiva. Proponemos varios algoritmos de recuperación sensibles al contexto basados en modelos de lenguaje estadístico para combinar las consultas anteriores y los resúmenes de documentos clicados con la consulta actual para una mejor clasificación de documentos. Utilizamos los datos de TREC AP para crear una colección de pruebas con información de <br>contexto</br> de búsqueda, y evaluamos cuantitativamente nuestros modelos utilizando este conjunto de pruebas.
