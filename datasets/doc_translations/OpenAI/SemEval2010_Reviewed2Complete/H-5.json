It combines the strengths of and extends beyond conventional adaptive filtering, novelty detection and non-redundant passage ranking with respect to long-lasting information needs (tasks with multiple queries). Our approach supports fine-grained user feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text, and leverages such information for utility optimization in adaptive settings. For our experiments, we defined hypothetical tasks based on news events in the TDT4 corpus, with multiple queries per task. Answer keys (nuggets) were generated for each query and a semiautomatic procedure was used for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses. We also propose an extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a combination of relevance and novelty. Our results show encouraging utility enhancements using the new approach, compared to the baseline systems without incremental learning or the novelty detection components.

INTRODUCTION Tracking new and relevant information from temporal data streams for users with long-lasting needs has been a challenging research topic in information retrieval. Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics. Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user. The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g. Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually. A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics). Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently. Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1. User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision. A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists. The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries. How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2. The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF. However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant. Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system. For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3. System-selected documents are often highly redundant. A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other. A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain. Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems. However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user. To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system. We call the new process utility-based information distillation. Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach. Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query. We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 . To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses. Moreover, we propose an extension of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a function of both relevance and novelty. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the information distillation process with a concrete example. Section 3 describes the technical cores of our system called CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. Section 4 discusses issues with respect to evaluation methodology and proposes a new scheme. Section 5 describes the extended TDT4 corpus. Section 6 presents our experiments and results. Section 7 concludes the study and gives future perspectives. 2. A SAMPLE TASK Consider a news event - the escape of seven convicts from a Texas prison in December 2000 and their capture a month later. Assuming a user were interested in this event since its early stage, the information need could be: Find information about the escape of convicts from Texas prison, and information related to their recapture. The associated lower-level questions could be: 1. How many prisoners escaped? 2. Where and when were they sighted? 3. Who are their known contacts inside and outside the prison? 4. How are they armed? 5. Do they have any vehicles? 6. What steps have been taken so far? We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task. A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user. Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list. When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant. These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history. Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples. As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference. For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile. This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list. However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history. The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly. Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search. Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list. Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents. Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND). Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task. Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system. Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages. The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system? Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3. TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21]. Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification. Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances. Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues). In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query. For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples. To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set. The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21]. The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile. The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received. A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system. Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user. For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated. We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past. Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred. Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity. Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors. The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list. Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts. A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet. However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list. Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents. We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization. Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1. Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2. Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3. Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined. After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list. The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4. EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology. Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels. Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time. Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists. None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects. Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers. Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them. Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways. Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems. Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences. Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description. For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match. For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?. In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit. Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison. Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context. Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold. However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below. These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget. For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule. For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below. We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents. In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 . In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget. The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))). Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match. Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision. We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs). As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison. We start with a simple rule - (seven). When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score. We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts. Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners). We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored. Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses. Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy. We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows. After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage. However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list. Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus. We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i. The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi. However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user. Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6. The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets. We combine these two factors as follows. For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past. The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ. Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q. The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11]. The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy. When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 . For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence. When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit. Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past. We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage. Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU). The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5. DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations. The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin. Speech-recognized and machine-translated versions of the non-English articles were provided as well. LDC [18] has annotated the corpus with 100 topics, that correspond to various news events in this time period. Out of these, we selected a subset of 12 actionable events, and defined corresponding tasks for them4 . For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples. For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 6.1 Baselines We used Indri [17], a popular language-model based retrieval engine, as a baseline for comparison with CAF´E. Indri supports standard search engine functionality, including pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) [3, 6], and is representative of a typical query-based retrieval system. Indri does not support any kind of novelty detection. We compare Indri with PRF turned on and off, against CAF´E with user feedback, novelty detection and antiredundant ranking turned on and off. 6.2 Experimental Setup We divided the TDT4 corpus spanning 4 months into 10 chunks, each defined as a period of 12 consecutive days. At any given point of time in the distillation process, each system accessed the past data up to the current point, and returned a ranked list of up 50 passages per query. The 12 tasks defined on the corpus were divided into a training and test set with 6 tasks each. Each system was allowed to use the training set to tune its parameters for optimizing NDCU (equation 8), including the relevance threshold for both Indri and CAF´E, and the novelty and antiredundancy thresholds for CAF´E. The NDCU for each system run is calculated automatically. User feedback was also simulated - relevance judgments for each system-returned passage (as determined by the nugget matching rules described in section 4.1.2) were 4 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads Figure 1: Performance of Indri across chunks Figure 2: Performance of CAF´E across chunks used as user feedback in the adaptation of query profiles and user histories. 6.3 Results In Table 1, we show the NDCU scores of the two systems under various settings. These scores are averaged over the six tasks in the test set, and are calculated with two dampening factors (see section 4.2): γ = 0 and 0.1, to simulate no tolerance and small tolerance for redundancy, respectively. Using γ = 0 creates a much more strict metric since it does not give any credit to a passage that contains relevant but redundant information. Hence, the improvement obtained from enabling user feedback is smaller with γ = 0 than the improvement obtained from feedback with γ = 0.1. This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information. However, the user does not benefit from seeing such redundant passages, and is usually interested in other passages containing related information. It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with γ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback. Sometimes, however, users might indeed be interested in seeing the same information from multiple sources, as an Table 1: NDCU Scores of Indri and CAF´E for two dampening factors (γ), and various settings (F: Feedback, N: Novelty Detection, A: Anti-Redundant Ranking) Indri CAF´E γ Base +PRF Base +F +F+N +F+A +F+N+A 0 0.19 0.19 0.22 0.23 0.24 0.24 0.24 0.1 0.28 0.29 0.24 0.35 0.35 0.36 0.36 indicator of its importance or reliability. In such a case, we can simply choose a higher value for γ which corresponds to a higher tolerance for redundancy, and hence let the system tune its parameters accordingly. Since documents were processed chunk by chunk, it would be interesting to see how the performance of systems improves over time. Figures 1 and 2 show the performance trends for both the systems across chunks. While the performance with and without feedback on the first few chunks is expected to be close, for subsequent chunks, the performance curve with feedback enabled rises above the one with the no-feedback setting. The performance trends are not consistent across all chunks because on-topic documents are not uniformly distributed over all the chunks, making some queries easier than others in certain chunks. Moreover, since Indri uses pseudo-relevance feedback while CAF´E uses feedback based on actual relevance judgments, the improvement in case of Indri is less dramatic than that of CAF´E. 7. CONCLUDING REMARKS This paper presents the first investigation on utility-based information distillation with a system that learns the longlasting information needs from fine-grained user feedback over a sequence of ranked passages. Our system, called CAF´E, combines adaptive filtering, novelty detection and antiredundant passage ranking in a unified framework for utility optimization. We developed a new scheme for automated evaluation and feedback based on a semi-automatic procedure for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses. We also proposed an extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a weighted combination of relevance and novelty. Our experiments on the newly annotated TDT4 benchmark corpus show encouraging utility enhancement over Indri, and also over our own system with incremental learning and novelty detection turned off. 8.

Combina las fortalezas y se extiende más allá del filtrado adaptativo convencional, la detección de novedades y la clasificación de pasajes no redundantes con respecto a las necesidades de información duraderas (tareas con múltiples consultas). Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva metodología de evaluación. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la destilación de información basada en la utilidad con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y clasificación de pasajes antirredundantes en un marco unificado para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.

        "Answer keys (nuggets) were generated for each query and a semiautomatic procedure was used for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses.",
        "We also propose an extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a combination of relevance and novelty.",
        "Our results show encouraging utility enhancements using the new approach, compared to the baseline systems without incremental learning or the novelty detection components.",

        "INTRODUCTION Tracking new and relevant information from temporal data streams for users with long-lasting needs has been a challenging research topic in information retrieval.",
        "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
        "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
        "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
        "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
        "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
        "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
        "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
        "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
        "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
        "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
        "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
        "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
        "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
        "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
        "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
        "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
        "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
        "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
        "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
        "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
        "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
        "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
        "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
        "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
        "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",
        "We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 .",
        "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",

        "A SAMPLE TASK Consider a news event - the escape of seven convicts from a Texas prison in December 2000 and their capture a month later.",
        "Assuming a user were interested in this event since its early stage, the information need could be: Find information about the escape of convicts from Texas prison, and information related to their recapture.",
        "The associated lower-level questions could be: 1.",
        "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",
        "Where and when were they sighted? 3. Who are their known contacts inside and outside the prison? 4.",
        "How are they armed? 5.",
        "Do they have any vehicles? 6.",
        "What steps have been taken so far?",
        "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
        "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
        "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
        "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
        "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
        "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
        "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
        "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
        "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
        "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
        "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
        "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
        "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
        "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
        "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
        "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
        "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
        "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
        "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
        "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
        "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
        "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
        "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
        "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
        "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
        "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
        "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
        "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
        "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
        "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
        "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
        "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
        "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
        "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
        "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
        "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
        "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
        "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
        "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
        "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
        "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
        "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
        "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
        "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
        "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
        "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
        "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
        "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
        "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
        "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
        "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
        "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
        "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
        "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
        "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
        "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
        "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
        "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
        "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
        "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
        "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
        "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
        "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
        "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
        "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
        "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
        "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
        "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
        "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
        "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
        "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
        "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
        "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
        "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
        "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
        "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
        "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
        "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
        "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
        "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
        "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
        "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
        "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
        "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
        "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
        "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
        "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
        "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
        "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
        "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
        "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
        "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
        "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
        "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
        "We combine these two factors as follows.",
        "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
        "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
        "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
        "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
        "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
        "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
        "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
        "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
        "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
        "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
        "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
        "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",
        "DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations.",
        "The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin.",
        "Speech-recognized and machine-translated versions of the non-English articles were provided as well.",
        "LDC [18] has annotated the corpus with 100 topics, that correspond to various news events in this time period.",
        "Out of these, we selected a subset of 12 actionable events, and defined corresponding tasks for them4 .",
        "For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.",
        "For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6.",
        "EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 6.1 Baselines We used Indri [17], a popular language-model based retrieval engine, as a baseline for comparison with CAF´E.",
        "Indri supports standard search engine functionality, including pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) [3, 6], and is representative of a typical query-based retrieval system.",
        "Indri does not support any kind of novelty detection.",
        "We compare Indri with PRF turned on and off, against CAF´E with user feedback, novelty detection and antiredundant ranking turned on and off. 6.2 Experimental Setup We divided the TDT4 corpus spanning 4 months into 10 chunks, each defined as a period of 12 consecutive days.",
        "At any given point of time in the distillation process, each system accessed the past data up to the current point, and returned a ranked list of up 50 passages per query.",
        "The 12 tasks defined on the corpus were divided into a training and test set with 6 tasks each.",
        "Each system was allowed to use the training set to tune its parameters for optimizing NDCU (equation 8), including the relevance threshold for both Indri and CAF´E, and the novelty and antiredundancy thresholds for CAF´E.",
        "The NDCU for each system run is calculated automatically.",
        "User feedback was also simulated - relevance judgments for each system-returned passage (as determined by the nugget matching rules described in section 4.1.2) were 4 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads Figure 1: Performance of Indri across chunks Figure 2: Performance of CAF´E across chunks used as user feedback in the adaptation of query profiles and user histories. 6.3 Results In Table 1, we show the NDCU scores of the two systems under various settings.",
        "These scores are averaged over the six tasks in the test set, and are calculated with two dampening factors (see section 4.2): γ = 0 and 0.1, to simulate no tolerance and small tolerance for redundancy, respectively.",
        "Using γ = 0 creates a much more strict metric since it does not give any credit to a passage that contains relevant but redundant information.",
        "Hence, the improvement obtained from enabling user feedback is smaller with γ = 0 than the improvement obtained from feedback with γ = 0.1.",
        "This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information.",
        "However, the user does not benefit from seeing such redundant passages, and is usually interested in other passages containing related information.",
        "It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with γ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback.",
        "Sometimes, however, users might indeed be interested in seeing the same information from multiple sources, as an Table 1: NDCU Scores of Indri and CAF´E for two dampening factors (γ), and various settings (F: Feedback, N: Novelty Detection, A: Anti-Redundant Ranking) Indri CAF´E γ Base +PRF Base +F +F+N +F+A +F+N+A 0 0.19 0.19 0.22 0.23 0.24 0.24 0.24 0.1 0.28 0.29 0.24 0.35 0.35 0.36 0.36 indicator of its importance or reliability.",
        "In such a case, we can simply choose a higher value for γ which corresponds to a higher tolerance for redundancy, and hence let the system tune its parameters accordingly.",
        "Since documents were processed chunk by chunk, it would be interesting to see how the performance of systems improves over time.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 show the performance trends for both the systems across chunks.",
        "While the performance with and without feedback on the first few chunks is expected to be close, for subsequent chunks, the performance curve with feedback enabled rises above the one with the no-feedback setting.",
        "The performance trends are not consistent across all chunks because on-topic documents are not uniformly distributed over all the chunks, making some queries easier than others in certain chunks.",
        "Moreover, since Indri uses pseudo-relevance feedback while CAF´E uses feedback based on actual relevance judgments, the improvement in case of Indri is less dramatic than that of CAF´E. 7.",
        "CONCLUDING REMARKS This paper presents the first investigation on utility-based information distillation with a system that learns the longlasting information needs from fine-grained user feedback over a sequence of ranked passages.",
        "Our system, called CAF´E, combines adaptive filtering, novelty detection and antiredundant passage ranking in a unified framework for utility optimization.",
        "We developed a new scheme for automated evaluation and feedback based on a semi-automatic procedure for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses.",

        "La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista.",
        "Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes.",

        "Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta.",
        "Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada.",
        "Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada).",
        "El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia.",
        "Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa.",

        "Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados.",
        "La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este?",
        "Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3.",
        "NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21].",
        "La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística.",
        "Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas.",
        "Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación).",
        "En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta.",
        "Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales.",
        "Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento.",
        "Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21].",
        "El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta.",
        "El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario.",
        "Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema.",
        "Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario.",
        "Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término.",
        "Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado.",
        "Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera.",
        "Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada.",
        "Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF.",
        "El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada.",
        "Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados.",
        "Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído.",
        "Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada.",
        "Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido.",
        "Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes.",
        "Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1.",
        "Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2.",
        "Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista.",
        "Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual.",
        "Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada.",
        "El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4.",
        "METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación.",
        "En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad.",
        "En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo.",
        "En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas.",
        "Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos.",
        "Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva metodología de evaluación. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas.",
        "Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no.",
        "La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes.",
        "Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas.",
        "Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos.",
        "Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada.",
        "Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia.",
        "Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon?",
        "En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia.",
        "El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\".",
        "Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto.",
        "Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral.",
        "Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación.",
        "Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita.",
        "Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla.",
        "Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación.",
        "Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos.",
        "En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2.",
        "En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento.",
        "La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))).",
        "Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida.",
        "Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación.",
        "Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O).",
        "Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas.",
        "Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete).",
        "Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión.",
        "Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos.",
        "A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros).",
        "Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura.",
        "Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto).",
        "La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió.",
        "Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera.",
        "Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje.",
        "Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada.",
        "Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4.",
        "Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i.",
        "La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi.",
        "Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario.",
        "Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6.",
        "La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas.",
        "Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera.",
        "Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado.",
        "La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ.",
        "Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q.",
        "Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11].",
        "La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia.",
        "Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero.",
        "Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva.",
        "Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito.",

En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones.",

        "Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada.",
        "Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario.",
        "A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad.",
        "En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia.",

        "Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación.",
        "Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos.",
        "Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7.",

                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process <br>utility-based information distillation</br>.",

                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",

                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",

                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",
                "DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations.",
                "The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin.",
                "Speech-recognized and machine-translated versions of the non-English articles were provided as well.",
                "LDC [18] has annotated the corpus with 100 topics, that correspond to various news events in this time period.",
                "Out of these, we selected a subset of 12 actionable events, and defined corresponding tasks for them4 .",
                "For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.",
                "For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6.",

                "Indri supports standard search engine functionality, including pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) [3, 6], and is representative of a typical query-based retrieval system.",
                "Indri does not support any kind of novelty detection.",
                "We compare Indri with PRF turned on and off, against CAF´E with user feedback, novelty detection and antiredundant ranking turned on and off. 6.2 Experimental Setup We divided the TDT4 corpus spanning 4 months into 10 chunks, each defined as a period of 12 consecutive days.",
                "At any given point of time in the distillation process, each system accessed the past data up to the current point, and returned a ranked list of up 50 passages per query.",

                "Each system was allowed to use the training set to tune its parameters for optimizing NDCU (equation 8), including the relevance threshold for both Indri and CAF´E, and the novelty and antiredundancy thresholds for CAF´E.",

                "These scores are averaged over the six tasks in the test set, and are calculated with two dampening factors (see section 4.2): γ = 0 and 0.1, to simulate no tolerance and small tolerance for redundancy, respectively.",
                "Using γ = 0 creates a much more strict metric since it does not give any credit to a passage that contains relevant but redundant information.",
                "Hence, the improvement obtained from enabling user feedback is smaller with γ = 0 than the improvement obtained from feedback with γ = 0.1.",
                "This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information.",
                "However, the user does not benefit from seeing such redundant passages, and is usually interested in other passages containing related information.",
                "It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with γ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback.",

Combina las fortalezas y se extiende más allá del filtrado adaptativo convencional, la detección de novedades y la clasificación de pasajes no redundantes con respecto a las necesidades de información duraderas (tareas con múltiples consultas). Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso <br>destilación de información basada en utilidad</br>. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la <br>destilación de información basada en utilidad</br> sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva metodología de evaluación. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la <br>destilación de información basada en la utilidad</br> con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y clasificación de pasajes antirredundantes en un marco unificado para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.

                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",

                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",
                "DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations.",
                "The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin.",
                "Speech-recognized and machine-translated versions of the non-English articles were provided as well.",
                "LDC [18] has annotated the corpus with 100 topics, that correspond to various news events in this time period.",
                "Out of these, we selected a subset of 12 actionable events, and defined corresponding tasks for them4 .",
                "For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.",
                "For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6.",

                "Indri does not support any kind of novelty detection.",
                "We compare Indri with PRF turned on and off, against CAF´E with user feedback, novelty detection and antiredundant ranking turned on and off. 6.2 Experimental Setup We divided the TDT4 corpus spanning 4 months into 10 chunks, each defined as a period of 12 consecutive days.",
                "At any given point of time in the distillation process, each system accessed the past data up to the current point, and returned a ranked list of up 50 passages per query.",

                "Each system was allowed to use the training set to tune its parameters for optimizing NDCU (equation 8), including the relevance threshold for both Indri and CAF´E, and the novelty and antiredundancy thresholds for CAF´E.",

                "This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information.",

Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre <br>documentos ordenados temporalmente</br>. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva metodología de evaluación. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la destilación de información basada en la utilidad con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y clasificación de pasajes antirredundantes en un marco unificado para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.

                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",

                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",

                "Assuming a user were interested in this event since its early stage, the information need could be: Find information about the escape of convicts from Texas prison, and information related to their recapture.",
                "The associated lower-level questions could be: 1.",
                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",

                "What steps have been taken so far?",
                "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "<br>passage ranking</br> here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",
                "DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations.",
                "The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin.",

                "For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.",
                "For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6.",

Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La <br>clasificación de pasajes</br> aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva metodología de evaluación. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la destilación de información basada en la utilidad con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y <br>clasificación de pasajes</br> antirredundantes en un marco unificado para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.

                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",

                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional <br>adaptive filtering</br> setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",

                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",

                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",

                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with <br>adaptive filtering</br> for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 <br>adaptive filtering</br> Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in <br>adaptive filtering</br>, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In <br>adaptive filtering</br>, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for <br>adaptive filtering</br> (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, <br>adaptive filtering</br>, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an <br>adaptive filtering</br> setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El <br>filtrado adaptativo</br> (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de <br>filtrado adaptativo</br>, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de <br>filtrado adaptativo</br>: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. ",

                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",

                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",

                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in <br>ad-hoc retrieval</br>, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",

Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten <br>recuperación ad-hoc</br> (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la <br>recuperación ad-hoc</br> (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la <br>recuperación ad-hoc</br>, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva metodología de evaluación. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la destilación de información basada en la utilidad con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y clasificación de pasajes antirredundantes en un marco unificado para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.

                "Answer keys (nuggets) were generated for each query and a semiautomatic procedure was used for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses.",
                "We also propose an extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a combination of relevance and novelty.",

                "INTRODUCTION Tracking new and relevant information from temporal data streams for users with long-lasting needs has been a challenging research topic in information retrieval.",
                "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for <br>novelty detection</br> can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and <br>novelty detection</br> for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",
                "We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 .",
                "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",
                "Moreover, we propose an extension of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a function of both relevance and novelty.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 outlines the information distillation process with a concrete example.",
                "Section 3 describes the technical cores of our system called CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine.",
                "Section 4 discusses issues with respect to evaluation methodology and proposes a new scheme.",
                "Section 5 describes the extended TDT4 corpus.",
                "Section 6 presents our experiments and results.",
                "Section 7 concludes the study and gives future perspectives. 2.",
                "A SAMPLE TASK Consider a news event - the escape of seven convicts from a Texas prison in December 2000 and their capture a month later.",
                "Assuming a user were interested in this event since its early stage, the information need could be: Find information about the escape of convicts from Texas prison, and information related to their recapture.",
                "The associated lower-level questions could be: 1.",
                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",
                "Where and when were they sighted? 3. Who are their known contacts inside and outside the prison? 4.",
                "How are they armed? 5.",
                "Do they have any vehicles? 6.",
                "What steps have been taken so far?",
                "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, <br>novelty detection</br> is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without <br>novelty detection</br>, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and <br>novelty detection</br> (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of <br>novelty detection</br> integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the <br>novelty detection</br> step. 3.3 <br>novelty detection</br> Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the <br>novelty detection</br> component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by <br>novelty detection</br> component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, <br>novelty detection</br> or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",

                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",

Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de <br>detección de novedades</br>.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de <br>detección de novedades</br> pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y <br>detección de novedades</br> para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la <br>detección de novedades</br> es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. ",

                "INTRODUCTION Tracking new and relevant information from temporal data streams for users with long-lasting needs has been a challenging research topic in information retrieval.",
                "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",
                "We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 .",
                "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",
                "Moreover, we propose an extension of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a function of both relevance and novelty.",

                "Assuming a user were interested in this event since its early stage, the information need could be: Find information about the escape of convicts from Texas prison, and information related to their recapture.",
                "The associated lower-level questions could be: 1.",
                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",
                "Where and when were they sighted? 3. Who are their known contacts inside and outside the prison? 4.",

                "Do they have any vehicles? 6.",
                "What steps have been taken so far?",
                "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a <br>new evaluation methodology</br>. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",

                "It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with γ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback.",

Combina las fortalezas y se extiende más allá del filtrado adaptativo convencional, la detección de novedades y la clasificación de pasajes no redundantes con respecto a las necesidades de información duraderas (tareas con múltiples consultas). Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una <br>nueva metodología de evaluación</br>. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la destilación de información basada en la utilidad con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y clasificación de pasajes antirredundantes en un marco unificado para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.

                "Answer keys (nuggets) were generated for each query and a semiautomatic procedure was used for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses.",
                "We also propose an extension of the NDCG metric for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a combination of relevance and novelty.",
                "Our results show encouraging utility enhancements using the new approach, compared to the baseline systems without incremental learning or the novelty detection components.",

                "INTRODUCTION Tracking new and relevant information from temporal data streams for users with long-lasting needs has been a challenging research topic in information retrieval.",
                "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",
                "We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 .",
                "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",
                "Moreover, we propose an extension of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a function of both relevance and novelty.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",

                "A SAMPLE TASK Consider a news event - the escape of seven convicts from a Texas prison in December 2000 and their capture a month later.",
                "Assuming a user were interested in this event since its early stage, the information need could be: Find information about the escape of convicts from Texas prison, and information related to their recapture.",
                "The associated lower-level questions could be: 1.",
                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",
                "Where and when were they sighted? 3. Who are their known contacts inside and outside the prison? 4.",
                "How are they armed? 5.",
                "Do they have any vehicles? 6.",
                "What steps have been taken so far?",
                "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the <br>answer key</br> of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",
                "DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations.",
                "The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin.",
                "Speech-recognized and machine-translated versions of the non-English articles were provided as well.",
                "LDC [18] has annotated the corpus with 100 topics, that correspond to various news events in this time period.",
                "Out of these, we selected a subset of 12 actionable events, and defined corresponding tasks for them4 .",
                "For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.",
                "For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6.",
                "EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 6.1 Baselines We used Indri [17], a popular language-model based retrieval engine, as a baseline for comparison with CAF´E.",
                "Indri supports standard search engine functionality, including pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) [3, 6], and is representative of a typical query-based retrieval system.",
                "Indri does not support any kind of novelty detection.",
                "We compare Indri with PRF turned on and off, against CAF´E with user feedback, novelty detection and antiredundant ranking turned on and off. 6.2 Experimental Setup We divided the TDT4 corpus spanning 4 months into 10 chunks, each defined as a period of 12 consecutive days.",
                "At any given point of time in the distillation process, each system accessed the past data up to the current point, and returned a ranked list of up 50 passages per query.",
                "The 12 tasks defined on the corpus were divided into a training and test set with 6 tasks each.",
                "Each system was allowed to use the training set to tune its parameters for optimizing NDCU (equation 8), including the relevance threshold for both Indri and CAF´E, and the novelty and antiredundancy thresholds for CAF´E.",
                "The NDCU for each system run is calculated automatically.",
                "User feedback was also simulated - relevance judgments for each system-returned passage (as determined by the nugget matching rules described in section 4.1.2) were 4 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads Figure 1: Performance of Indri across chunks Figure 2: Performance of CAF´E across chunks used as user feedback in the adaptation of query profiles and user histories. 6.3 Results In Table 1, we show the NDCU scores of the two systems under various settings.",
                "These scores are averaged over the six tasks in the test set, and are calculated with two dampening factors (see section 4.2): γ = 0 and 0.1, to simulate no tolerance and small tolerance for redundancy, respectively.",
                "Using γ = 0 creates a much more strict metric since it does not give any credit to a passage that contains relevant but redundant information.",
                "Hence, the improvement obtained from enabling user feedback is smaller with γ = 0 than the improvement obtained from feedback with γ = 0.1.",
                "This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information.",
                "However, the user does not benefit from seeing such redundant passages, and is usually interested in other passages containing related information.",
                "It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with γ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback.",
                "Sometimes, however, users might indeed be interested in seeing the same information from multiple sources, as an Table 1: NDCU Scores of Indri and CAF´E for two dampening factors (γ), and various settings (F: Feedback, N: Novelty Detection, A: Anti-Redundant Ranking) Indri CAF´E γ Base +PRF Base +F +F+N +F+A +F+N+A 0 0.19 0.19 0.22 0.23 0.24 0.24 0.24 0.1 0.28 0.29 0.24 0.35 0.35 0.36 0.36 indicator of its importance or reliability.",

                "Figures 1 and 2 show the performance trends for both the systems across chunks.",
                "While the performance with and without feedback on the first few chunks is expected to be close, for subsequent chunks, the performance curve with feedback enabled rises above the one with the no-feedback setting.",
                "The performance trends are not consistent across all chunks because on-topic documents are not uniformly distributed over all the chunks, making some queries easier than others in certain chunks.",

Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva metodología de evaluación. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la <br>clave de respuesta</br> de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la destilación de información basada en la utilidad con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y clasificación de pasajes antirredundantes en un marco unificado para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.

                "INTRODUCTION Tracking new and relevant information from temporal data streams for users with long-lasting needs has been a challenging research topic in information retrieval.",
                "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",
                "We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 .",
                "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",
                "Moreover, we propose an extension of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a function of both relevance and novelty.",

                "Assuming a user were interested in this event since its early stage, the information need could be: Find information about the escape of convicts from Texas prison, and information related to their recapture.",
                "The associated lower-level questions could be: 1.",
                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",
                "Where and when were they sighted? 3. Who are their known contacts inside and outside the prison? 4.",

                "Do they have any vehicles? 6.",
                "What steps have been taken so far?",
                "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",

                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on <br>nugget-matching rule</br>s, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create <br>nugget-matching rule</br>s that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",
                "DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations.",
                "The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin.",

                "Out of these, we selected a subset of 12 actionable events, and defined corresponding tasks for them4 .",
                "For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.",
                "For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6.",

                "Indri does not support any kind of novelty detection.",
                "We compare Indri with PRF turned on and off, against CAF´E with user feedback, novelty detection and antiredundant ranking turned on and off. 6.2 Experimental Setup We divided the TDT4 corpus spanning 4 months into 10 chunks, each defined as a period of 12 consecutive days.",
                "At any given point of time in the distillation process, each system accessed the past data up to the current point, and returned a ranked list of up 50 passages per query.",
                "The 12 tasks defined on the corpus were divided into a training and test set with 6 tasks each.",
                "Each system was allowed to use the training set to tune its parameters for optimizing NDCU (equation 8), including the relevance threshold for both Indri and CAF´E, and the novelty and antiredundancy thresholds for CAF´E.",

                "These scores are averaged over the six tasks in the test set, and are calculated with two dampening factors (see section 4.2): γ = 0 and 0.1, to simulate no tolerance and small tolerance for redundancy, respectively.",
                "Using γ = 0 creates a much more strict metric since it does not give any credit to a passage that contains relevant but redundant information.",
                "Hence, the improvement obtained from enabling user feedback is smaller with γ = 0 than the improvement obtained from feedback with γ = 0.1.",
                "This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information.",
                "However, the user does not benefit from seeing such redundant passages, and is usually interested in other passages containing related information.",
                "It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with γ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback.",

Combina las fortalezas y se extiende más allá del filtrado adaptativo convencional, la detección de novedades y la clasificación de pasajes no redundantes con respecto a las necesidades de información duraderas (tareas con múltiples consultas). Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva metodología de evaluación. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en <br>reglas de coincidencia de pepitas</br>, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear <br>reglas de coincidencia de pepitas</br> que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la destilación de información basada en la utilidad con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y clasificación de pasajes antirredundantes en un marco unificado para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.

                "INTRODUCTION Tracking new and relevant information from temporal data streams for users with long-lasting needs has been a challenging research topic in information retrieval.",
                "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",
                "We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 .",
                "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",
                "Moreover, we propose an extension of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a function of both relevance and novelty.",

                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",

                "What steps have been taken so far?",
                "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",
                "DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations.",
                "The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin.",

                "For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.",
                "For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6.",

                "We compare Indri with PRF turned on and off, against CAF´E with user feedback, novelty detection and antiredundant ranking turned on and off. 6.2 Experimental Setup We divided the TDT4 corpus spanning 4 months into 10 chunks, each defined as a period of 12 consecutive days.",
                "At any given point of time in the distillation process, each system accessed the past data up to the current point, and returned a ranked list of up 50 passages per query.",

                "Each system was allowed to use the training set to tune its parameters for optimizing NDCU (equation 8), including the relevance threshold for both Indri and CAF´E, and the novelty and antiredundancy thresholds for CAF´E.",

                "These scores are averaged over the six tasks in the test set, and are calculated with two dampening factors (see section 4.2): γ = 0 and 0.1, to simulate no tolerance and small tolerance for redundancy, respectively.",
                "Using γ = 0 creates a much more strict metric since it does not give any credit to a passage that contains relevant but redundant information.",
                "Hence, the improvement obtained from enabling user feedback is smaller with γ = 0 than the improvement obtained from feedback with γ = 0.1.",
                "This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information.",
                "However, the user does not benefit from seeing such redundant passages, and is usually interested in other passages containing related information.",
                "It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with γ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback.",

Combina las fortalezas y se extiende más allá del filtrado adaptativo convencional, la detección de novedades y la clasificación de pasajes no redundantes con respecto a las necesidades de información duraderas (tareas con múltiples consultas). Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva metodología de evaluación. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la destilación de información basada en la utilidad con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y clasificación de pasajes antirredundantes en un <br>marco unificado</br> para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.

                "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",
                "We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 .",
                "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",

                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",

                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",
                "DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations.",
                "The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin.",

                "For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.",
                "For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6.",

                "This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information.",

Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva metodología de evaluación. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la destilación de información basada en la utilidad con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y clasificación de pasajes antirredundantes en un marco unificado para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la <br>métrica NDCG</br> para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.

                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",

                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",

                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",

                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",

                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",

                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",
                "DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations.",
                "The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin.",
                "Speech-recognized and machine-translated versions of the non-English articles were provided as well.",
                "LDC [18] has annotated the corpus with 100 topics, that correspond to various news events in this time period.",
                "Out of these, we selected a subset of 12 actionable events, and defined corresponding tasks for them4 .",
                "For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.",
                "For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6.",

                "Indri supports standard search engine functionality, including pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) [3, 6], and is representative of a typical query-based retrieval system.",
                "Indri does not support any kind of novelty detection.",
                "We compare Indri with PRF turned on and off, against CAF´E with user feedback, novelty detection and antiredundant ranking turned on and off. 6.2 Experimental Setup We divided the TDT4 corpus spanning 4 months into 10 chunks, each defined as a period of 12 consecutive days.",
                "At any given point of time in the distillation process, each system accessed the past data up to the current point, and returned a ranked list of up 50 passages per query.",

                "Each system was allowed to use the training set to tune its parameters for optimizing NDCU (equation 8), including the relevance threshold for both Indri and CAF´E, and the novelty and antiredundancy thresholds for CAF´E.",

                "These scores are averaged over the six tasks in the test set, and are calculated with two dampening factors (see section 4.2): γ = 0 and 0.1, to simulate no tolerance and small tolerance for redundancy, respectively.",
                "Using γ = 0 creates a much more strict metric since it does not give any credit to a passage that contains relevant but redundant information.",
                "Hence, the improvement obtained from enabling user feedback is smaller with γ = 0 than the improvement obtained from feedback with γ = 0.1.",
                "This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information.",
                "However, the user does not benefit from seeing such redundant passages, and is usually interested in other passages containing related information.",
                "It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with γ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback.",

                "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",
                "We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 .",
                "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",
                "Moreover, we propose an extension of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a function of both relevance and novelty.",

                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",

                "What steps have been taken so far?",
                "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",
                "DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations.",
                "The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin.",
                "Speech-recognized and machine-translated versions of the non-English articles were provided as well.",
                "LDC [18] has annotated the corpus with 100 topics, that correspond to various news events in this time period.",
                "Out of these, we selected a subset of 12 actionable events, and defined corresponding tasks for them4 .",
                "For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.",
                "For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6.",
                "EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 6.1 Baselines We used Indri [17], a popular language-model based retrieval engine, as a baseline for comparison with CAF´E.",
                "Indri supports standard search engine functionality, including pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) [3, 6], and is representative of a typical query-based retrieval system.",
                "Indri does not support any kind of novelty detection.",
                "We compare Indri with PRF turned on and off, against CAF´E with user feedback, novelty detection and antiredundant ranking turned on and off. 6.2 Experimental Setup We divided the TDT4 corpus spanning 4 months into 10 chunks, each defined as a period of 12 consecutive days.",
                "At any given point of time in the distillation process, each system accessed the past data up to the current point, and returned a ranked list of up 50 passages per query.",
                "The 12 tasks defined on the corpus were divided into a training and test set with 6 tasks each.",
                "Each system was allowed to use the training set to tune its parameters for optimizing NDCU (equation 8), including the relevance threshold for both Indri and CAF´E, and the novelty and antiredundancy thresholds for CAF´E.",
                "The NDCU for each system run is calculated automatically.",
                "User feedback was also simulated - relevance judgments for each system-returned passage (as determined by the nugget matching rules described in section 4.1.2) were 4 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads Figure 1: Performance of Indri across chunks Figure 2: Performance of CAF´E across chunks used as user feedback in the adaptation of query profiles and user histories. 6.3 Results In Table 1, we show the NDCU scores of the two systems under various settings.",
                "These scores are averaged over the six tasks in the test set, and are calculated with two dampening factors (see section 4.2): γ = 0 and 0.1, to simulate no tolerance and small tolerance for redundancy, respectively.",
                "Using γ = 0 creates a much more strict metric since it does not give any credit to a passage that contains relevant but redundant information.",
                "Hence, the improvement obtained from enabling user feedback is smaller with γ = 0 than the improvement obtained from feedback with γ = 0.1.",
                "This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information.",
                "However, the user does not benefit from seeing such redundant passages, and is usually interested in other passages containing related information.",
                "It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with γ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback.",

                "Figures 1 and 2 show the performance trends for both the systems across chunks.",
                "While the performance with and without feedback on the first few chunks is expected to be close, for subsequent chunks, the performance curve with feedback enabled rises above the one with the no-feedback setting.",
                "The performance trends are not consistent across all chunks because on-topic documents are not uniformly distributed over all the chunks, making some queries easier than others in certain chunks.",

                "Answer keys (nuggets) were generated for each query and a semiautomatic procedure was used for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses.",

                "INTRODUCTION Tracking new and relevant information from temporal data streams for users with long-lasting needs has been a challenging research topic in information retrieval.",
                "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent <br>adaptive filter</br>ing research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional <br>adaptive filter</br>ing setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",
                "We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 .",
                "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",
                "Moreover, we propose an extension of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a function of both relevance and novelty.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",

                "A SAMPLE TASK Consider a news event - the escape of seven convicts from a Texas prison in December 2000 and their capture a month later.",
                "Assuming a user were interested in this event since its early stage, the information need could be: Find information about the escape of convicts from Texas prison, and information related to their recapture.",
                "The associated lower-level questions could be: 1.",
                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",
                "Where and when were they sighted? 3. Who are their known contacts inside and outside the prison? 4.",
                "How are they armed? 5.",
                "Do they have any vehicles? 6.",
                "What steps have been taken so far?",
                "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of <br>adaptive filter</br>ing (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with <br>adaptive filter</br>ing for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in <br>adaptive filter</br>ing, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In <br>adaptive filter</br>ing, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for <br>adaptive filter</br>ing (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, <br>adaptive filter</br>ing, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",

Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de <br>filtrado adaptativo</br>, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de <br>filtrado adaptativo</br>: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del <br>filtrado adaptativo</br> (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con <br>filtrado adaptativo</br> para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados.

                "INTRODUCTION Tracking new and relevant information from temporal data streams for users with long-lasting needs has been a challenging research topic in information retrieval.",
                "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",

                "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",
                "Moreover, we propose an extension of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a function of both relevance and novelty.",

                "Assuming a user were interested in this event since its early stage, the information need could be: Find information about the escape of convicts from Texas prison, and information related to their recapture.",
                "The associated lower-level questions could be: 1.",
                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",
                "Where and when were they sighted? 3. Who are their known contacts inside and outside the prison? 4.",
                "How are they armed? 5.",
                "Do they have any vehicles? 6.",
                "What steps have been taken so far?",
                "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",

                "These scores are averaged over the six tasks in the test set, and are calculated with two dampening factors (see section 4.2): γ = 0 and 0.1, to simulate no tolerance and small tolerance for redundancy, respectively.",
                "Using γ = 0 creates a much more strict metric since it does not give any credit to a passage that contains relevant but redundant information.",

                "This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information.",
                "However, the user does not benefit from seeing such redundant passages, and is usually interested in other passages containing related information.",
                "It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with γ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback.",

Combina las fortalezas y se extiende más allá del filtrado adaptativo convencional, la detección de novedades y la <br>clasificación de pasajes</br> no redundantes con respecto a las necesidades de información duraderas (tareas con múltiples consultas). Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la metodología de evaluación y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la metodología de evaluación: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la metodología de evaluación. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva metodología de evaluación. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la destilación de información basada en la utilidad con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y <br>clasificación de pasajes</br> antirredundantes en un marco unificado para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.

                "Answer keys (nuggets) were generated for each query and a semiautomatic procedure was used for acquiring rules that allow automatically matching nuggets against system responses.",

                "INTRODUCTION Tracking new and relevant information from temporal data streams for users with long-lasting needs has been a challenging research topic in information retrieval.",
                "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",
                "We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 .",
                "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",
                "Moreover, we propose an extension of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a function of both relevance and novelty.",

                "A SAMPLE TASK Consider a news event - the escape of seven convicts from a Texas prison in December 2000 and their capture a month later.",
                "Assuming a user were interested in this event since its early stage, the information need could be: Find information about the escape of convicts from Texas prison, and information related to their recapture.",
                "The associated lower-level questions could be: 1.",
                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",
                "Where and when were they sighted? 3. Who are their known contacts inside and outside the prison? 4.",
                "How are they armed? 5.",
                "Do they have any vehicles? 6.",
                "What steps have been taken so far?",
                "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding evaluation methodology: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "EVALUATION METHODOLOGY The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding evaluation methodology.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new evaluation methodology. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",
                "For each nugget Nj, we assign an initial weight wj, and also keep a count nj of the number of times this nugget has been seen by the user in the past.",
                "The gain derived from each subsequent occurrence of the same nugget is assumed to reduce by a dampening factor γ.",
                "Thus, G(pi, q) is defined as G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) where C(pi, q) is the set of all nuggets that appear in passage pi and also belong to the answer key of query q.",
                "The initial weights wj are all set of be 1.0 in our experiments, but can also be set based on a pyramid approach [11].",
                "The choice of dampening factor γ determines the users tolerance for redundancy.",
                "When γ = 0, a nugget will only receive credit for its first occurrence i.e. when nj is zero3 .",
                "For 0 < γ < 1, a nugget receives smaller credit for each successive occurrence.",
                "When γ = 1, no dampening occurs and repeated occurrences of a nugget receive the same credit.",
                "Note that the nugget occurrence counts are preserved between evaluation of successive ranked lists returned by the system, since the users are expected to remember what the system showed them in the past.",
                "We define the loss L(pi, q) as a constant cost c (we use 0.1) incurred when reading a system-returned passage.",
                "Thus, our metric can be re-written as U(q) = nX i=1 Gain(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) where L(n) is the loss associated with a ranked list of length n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Note that 00 = 1 Due to the similarity with Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG), we call our metric Discounted Cumulated Utility (DCU).",
                "The DCU score obtained by the system is converted to a Normalized DCU (NDCU) score by dividing it by the DCU score of the ideal ranked list, which is created by ordering passages by their decreasing utility scores U(pi, q) and stopping when U(pi, q) ≤ 0 i.e. when the gain is less than or equal to the cost of reading the passage. 5.",
                "DATA TDT4 was the benchmark corpus used in TDT2002 and TDT2003 evaluations.",
                "The corpus consists of over 90, 000 news articles from multiple sources (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) published between October 2000 and January 2001, in the languages of Arabic, English, and Mandarin.",
                "Speech-recognized and machine-translated versions of the non-English articles were provided as well.",
                "LDC [18] has annotated the corpus with 100 topics, that correspond to various news events in this time period.",
                "Out of these, we selected a subset of 12 actionable events, and defined corresponding tasks for them4 .",
                "For each task, we manually defined a profile consisting of an initial set of (5 to 10) queries, a free-text description of the user history, i.e., what the user already knows about the event, and a list of known on-topic and off-topic documents (if available) as training examples.",
                "For each query, we generated answer keys and corresponding nugget matching rules using the procedure described in section 4.1.2, and produced a total of 120 queries, with an average of 7 nuggets per query. 6.",
                "EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 6.1 Baselines We used Indri [17], a popular language-model based retrieval engine, as a baseline for comparison with CAF´E.",
                "Indri supports standard search engine functionality, including pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) [3, 6], and is representative of a typical query-based retrieval system.",
                "Indri does not support any kind of novelty detection.",
                "We compare Indri with PRF turned on and off, against CAF´E with user feedback, novelty detection and antiredundant ranking turned on and off. 6.2 Experimental Setup We divided the TDT4 corpus spanning 4 months into 10 chunks, each defined as a period of 12 consecutive days.",
                "At any given point of time in the distillation process, each system accessed the past data up to the current point, and returned a ranked list of up 50 passages per query.",
                "The 12 tasks defined on the corpus were divided into a training and test set with 6 tasks each.",
                "Each system was allowed to use the training set to tune its parameters for optimizing NDCU (equation 8), including the relevance threshold for both Indri and CAF´E, and the novelty and antiredundancy thresholds for CAF´E.",
                "The NDCU for each system run is calculated automatically.",
                "User feedback was also simulated - relevance judgments for each system-returned passage (as determined by the nugget matching rules described in section 4.1.2) were 4 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads Figure 1: Performance of Indri across chunks Figure 2: Performance of CAF´E across chunks used as user feedback in the adaptation of query profiles and user histories. 6.3 Results In Table 1, we show the NDCU scores of the two systems under various settings.",
                "These scores are averaged over the six tasks in the test set, and are calculated with two dampening factors (see section 4.2): γ = 0 and 0.1, to simulate no tolerance and small tolerance for redundancy, respectively.",
                "Using γ = 0 creates a much more strict metric since it does not give any credit to a passage that contains relevant but redundant information.",
                "Hence, the improvement obtained from enabling user feedback is smaller with γ = 0 than the improvement obtained from feedback with γ = 0.1.",
                "This reveals a shortcoming of contemporary retrieval systemswhen the user gives positive feedback on a passage, the systems gives higher weights to the terms present in that passage and tends to retrieve other passages containing the same terms - and thus - usually the same information.",
                "However, the user does not benefit from seeing such redundant passages, and is usually interested in other passages containing related information.",
                "It is informative to evaluate retrieval systems using our utility measure (with γ = 0) which accounts for novelty and thus gives a more realistic picture of how well a system can generalize from user feedback, rather than using traditional IR measures like recall and precision which give an incomplete picture of improvement obtained from user feedback.",
                "Sometimes, however, users might indeed be interested in seeing the same information from multiple sources, as an Table 1: NDCU Scores of Indri and CAF´E for two dampening factors (γ), and various settings (F: Feedback, N: Novelty Detection, A: Anti-Redundant Ranking) Indri CAF´E γ Base +PRF Base +F +F+N +F+A +F+N+A 0 0.19 0.19 0.22 0.23 0.24 0.24 0.24 0.1 0.28 0.29 0.24 0.35 0.35 0.36 0.36 indicator of its importance or reliability.",

                "Figures 1 and 2 show the performance trends for both the systems across chunks.",
                "While the performance with and without feedback on the first few chunks is expected to be close, for subsequent chunks, the performance curve with feedback enabled rises above the one with the no-feedback setting.",
                "The performance trends are not consistent across all chunks because on-topic documents are not uniformly distributed over all the chunks, making some queries easier than others in certain chunks.",
                "Moreover, since Indri uses pseudo-relevance feedback while CAF´E uses feedback based on actual relevance judgments, the improvement in case of Indri is less dramatic than that of CAF´E. 7.",

                "INTRODUCTION Tracking new and relevant information from temporal data streams for users with long-lasting needs has been a challenging research topic in information retrieval.",
                "Adaptive filtering (AF) is one such task of online prediction of the relevance of each new document with respect to pre-defined topics.",
                "Based on the initial query and a few positive examples (if available), an AF system maintains a profile for each such topic of interest, and constantly updates it based on feedback from the user.",
                "The incremental learning nature of AF systems makes them more powerful than standard search engines that support ad-hoc retrieval (e.g.",
                "Google and Yahoo) in terms of finding relevant information with respect to long-lasting topics of interest, and more attractive for users who are willing to provide feedback to adapt the system towards their specific information needs, without having to modify their queries manually.",
                "A variety of supervised learning algorithms (Rocchio-style classifiers, Exponential-Gaussian models, local regression and logistic regression approaches) have been studied for adaptive settings, examined with explicit and implicit relevance feedback, and evaluated with respect to utility optimization on large benchmark data collections in TREC (Text Retrieval Conferences) and TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) forums [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23].",
                "Regularized logistic regression [21] has been found representative for the state-of-the-art approaches, and highly efficient for frequent model adaptations over large document collections such as the TREC-10 corpus (over 800,000 documents and 84 topics).",
                "Despite substantial achievements in recent adaptive filtering research, significant problems remain unsolved regarding how to leverage user feedback effectively and efficiently.",
                "Specifically, the following issues may seriously limit the true utility of AF systems in real-world applications: 1.",
                "User has a rather passive role in the conventional adaptive filtering setup - he or she reacts to the system only when the system makes a yes decision on a document, by confirming or rejecting that decision.",
                "A more active alternative would be to allow the user to issue multiple queries for a topic, review a ranked list of candidate documents (or passages) per query, and provide feedback on the ranked list, thus refining their information need and requesting updated ranked lists.",
                "The latter form of user interaction has been highly effective in standard retrieval for ad-hoc queries.",
                "How to deploy such a strategy for long-lasting information needs in AF settings is an open question for research. 2.",
                "The unit for receiving a relevance judgment (yes or no) is restricted to the document level in conventional AF.",
                "However, a real user may be willing to provide more informative, fine-grained feedback via highlighting some pieces of text in a retrieved document as relevant, instead of labeling the entire document as relevant.",
                "Effectively leveraging such fine-grained feedback could substantially enhance the quality of an AF system.",
                "For this, we need to enable supervised learning from labeled pieces of text of arbitrary span instead of just allowing labeled documents. 3.",
                "System-selected documents are often highly redundant.",
                "A major news event, for example, would be reported by multiple sources repeatedly for a while, making most of the information content in those articles redundant with each other.",
                "A conventional AF system would select all these redundant news stories for user feedback, wasting the users time while offering little gain.",
                "Clearly, techniques for novelty detection can help in principle [25, 2, 22] for improving the utility of the AF systems.",
                "However, the effectiveness of such techniques at passage level to detect novelty with respect to users (fine-grained) feedback and to detect redundancy in ranked lists remains to be evaluated using a measure of utility that mimics the needs of a real user.",
                "To address the above limitations of current AF systems, we propose and examine a new approach in this paper, combining the strengths of conventional AF (incremental learning of topic models), multi-pass passage retrieval for long-lasting queries conditioned on topic, and novelty detection for removal of redundancy from user interactions with the system.",
                "We call the new process utility-based information distillation.",
                "Note that conventional benchmark corpora for AF evaluations, which have relevance judgments at the document level and do not define tasks with multiple queries, are insufficient for evaluating the new approach.",
                "Therefore, we extended a benchmark corpus - the TDT4 collection of news stories and TV broadcasts - with task definitions, multiple queries per task, and answer keys per query.",
                "We have conducted our experiments on this extended TDT4 corpus and have made the additionally generated data publicly available for future comparative evaluations 1 .",
                "To automatically evaluate the system-returned arbitrary spans of text using our answer keys, we further developed an evaluation scheme with semi-automatic procedure for 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads acquiring rules that can match nuggets against system responses.",
                "Moreover, we propose an extension of NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] for assessing the utility of ranked passages as a function of both relevance and novelty.",

                "A SAMPLE TASK Consider a news event - the escape of seven convicts from a Texas prison in December 2000 and their capture a month later.",
                "Assuming a user were interested in this event since its early stage, the information need could be: Find information about the escape of convicts from Texas prison, and information related to their recapture.",
                "The associated lower-level questions could be: 1.",
                "How many prisoners escaped? 2.",
                "Where and when were they sighted? 3. Who are their known contacts inside and outside the prison? 4.",
                "How are they armed? 5.",
                "Do they have any vehicles? 6.",
                "What steps have been taken so far?",
                "We call such an information need a task, and the associated questions as the queries in this task.",
                "A distillation system is supposed to monitor the incoming documents, process them chunk by chunk in a temporal order, select potentially relevant and novel passages from each chunk with respect to each query, and present a ranked list of passages to the user.",
                "Passage ranking here is based on how relevant a passage is with respect to the current query, how novel it is with respect to the current user history (of his or her interactions with the system), and how redundant it is compared to other passages with a higher rank in the list.",
                "When presented with a list of passages, the user may provide feedback by highlighting arbitrary spans of text that he or she found relevant.",
                "These spans of text are taken as positive examples in the adaptation of the query profile, and also added to the users history.",
                "Passages not marked by the user are taken as negative examples.",
                "As soon as the query profile is updated, the system re-issues a search and returns another ranked list of passages where the previously seen passages are either removed or ranked low, based on user preference.",
                "For example, if the user highlights ...officials have posted a $100,000 reward for their capture... as relevant answer to the query What steps have been taken so far?, then the highlighted piece is used as an additional positive training example in the adaptation of the query profile.",
                "This piece of feedback is also added to the user history as a seen example, so that in future, the system will not place another passage mentioning $100,000 reward at the top of the ranked list.",
                "However, an article mentioning ...officials have doubled the reward money to $200,000... might be ranked high since it is both relevant to the (updated) query profile and novel with respect to the (updated) user history.",
                "The user may modify the original queries or add a new query during the process; the query profiles will be changed accordingly.",
                "Clearly, novelty detection is very important for the utility of such a system because of the iterative search.",
                "Without novelty detection, the old relevant passages would be shown to the user repeatedly in each ranked list.",
                "Through the above example, we can see the main properties of our new framework for utility-based information distillation over temporally ordered documents.",
                "Our framework combines and extends the power of adaptive filtering (AF), ad-hoc retrieval (IR) and novelty detection (ND).",
                "Compared to standard IR, our approach has the power of incrementally learning long-term information needs and modeling a sequence of queries within a task.",
                "Compared to conventional AF, it enables a more active role of the user in refining his or her information needs and requesting new results by allowing relevance and novelty feedback via highlighting of arbitrary spans of text in passages returned by the system.",
                "Compared to past work, this is the first evaluation of novelty detection integrated with adaptive filtering for sequenced queries that allows flexible user feedback over ranked passages.",
                "The combination of AF, IR and ND with the new extensions raises an important research question regarding <br>evaluation methodology</br>: how can we measure the utility of such an information distillation system?",
                "Existing metrics in standard IR, AF and ND are insufficient, and new solutions must be explored, as we will discuss in Section 4, after describing the technical cores of our system in the next section. 3.",
                "TECHNICAL CORES The core components of CAF´E are - 1) AF for incremental learning of query profiles, 2) IR for estimating relevance of passages with respect to query profiles, 3) ND for assessing novelty of passages with respect to users history, and 4) anti-redundancy component to remove redundancy from ranked lists. 3.1 Adaptive Filtering Component We use a state-of-the-art algorithm in the field - the regularized logistic regression method which had the best results on several benchmark evaluation corpora for AF [21].",
                "Logistic regression (LR) is a supervised learning algorithm for statistical classification.",
                "Based on a training set of labeled instances, it learns a class model which can then by used to predict the labels of unseen instances.",
                "Its performance as well as efficiency in terms of training time makes it a good candidate when frequent updates of the class model are required, as is the case in adaptive filtering, where the system must learn from each new feedback provided by the user. (See [21] and [23] for computational complexity and implementation issues).",
                "In adaptive filtering, each query is considered as a class and the probability of a passage belonging to this class corresponds to the degree of relevance of the passage with respect to the query.",
                "For training the model, we use the query itself as the initial positive training example of the class, and the user-highlighted pieces of text (marked as Relevant or Not-relevant) during feedback as additional training examples.",
                "To address the cold start issue in the early stage before any user feedback is obtained, the system uses a small sample from a retrospective corpus as the initial negative examples in the training set.",
                "The details of using logistic regression for adaptive filtering (assigning different weights to positive and negative training instances, and regularizing the objective function to prevent over-fitting on training data) are presented in [21].",
                "The class model w∗ learned by Logistic Regression, or the query profile, is a vector whose dimensions are individual terms and whose elements are the regression coefficients, indicating how influential each term is in the query profile.",
                "The query profile is updated whenever a new piece of user feedback is received.",
                "A temporally decaying weight can be applied to each training example, as an option, to emphasize the most recent user feedback. 3.2 Passage Retrieval Component We use standard IR techniques in this part of our system.",
                "Incoming documents are processed in chunks, where each chunk can be defined as a fixed span of time or as a fixed number of documents, as preferred by the user.",
                "For each incoming document, corpus statistics like the IDF (Inverted Document Frequency) of each term are updated.",
                "We use a state-of-the-art named entity identifier and tracker [8, 12] to identify person and location names, and merge them with co-referent named entities seen in the past.",
                "Then the documents are segmented into passages, which can be a whole document, a paragraph, a sentence, or any other continuous span of text, as preferred.",
                "Each passage is represented using a vector of TF-IDF (Term FrequencyInverse Document Frequency) weights, where term can be a word or a named entity.",
                "Given a query profile, i.e. the logistic regression solution w∗ as described in Section 3.1, the system computes the posterior probability of relevance for each passage x as fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1) Passages are ordered by their relevance scores, and the ones with scores above a threshold (tuned on a training set) comprise the relevance list that is passed on to the novelty detection step. 3.3 Novelty Detection Component CAF´E maintains a user history H(t), which contains all the spans of text hi that the user highlighted (as feedback) during his or her past interactions with the system, up to the current time t. Denoting the history as H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2) the novelty score of a new candidate passage x is computed as: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3) where both candidate passage x and highlighted spans of text hi are represented as TF-IDF vectors.",
                "The novelty score of each passage is compared to a prespecified threshold (also tuned on a training set), and any passage with a score below this threshold is removed from the relevance list. 3.4 Anti-redundant Ranking Component Although the novelty detection component ensures that only novel (previously unseen) information remains in the relevance list, this list might still contain the same novel information at multiple positions in the ranked list.",
                "Suppose, for example, that the user has already read about a $100,000 reward for information about the escaped convicts.",
                "A new piece of news that the award has been increased to $200,000 is novel since the user hasnt read about it yet.",
                "However, multiple news sources would report this news and we might end up showing (redundant) articles from all these sources in a ranked list.",
                "Hence, a ranked list should also be made non-redundant with respect to its own contents.",
                "We use a simplified version of the Maximal Marginal Relevance method [5], originally developed for combining relevance and novelty in text retrieval and summarization.",
                "Our procedure starts with the current list of passages sorted by relevance (section 3.2), filtered by Novelty Detection component (section 3.3), and generates a new non-redundant list as follows: 1.",
                "Take the top passage in the current list as the top one in the new list. 2.",
                "Add the next passage x in the current list to the new list only if fAR(x) > t where fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} and Lnew is the set of passages already selected in the new list. 3.",
                "Repeat step 2 until all the passages in the current list have been examined.",
                "After applying the above-mentioned algorithm, each passage in the new list is sufficiently dissimilar to others, thus favoring diversity rather than redundancy in the new ranked list.",
                "The anti-redundancy threshold t is tuned on a training set. 4.",
                "<br>evaluation methodology</br> The approach we proposed above for information distillation raises important issues regarding <br>evaluation methodology</br>.",
                "Firstly, since our framework allows the output to be passages at different levels of granularity (e.g. k-sentence windows where k may vary) instead of a fixed length, it is not possible to have pre-annotated relevance judgments at all such granularity levels.",
                "Secondly, since we wish to measure the utility of the system output as a combination of both relevance and novelty, traditional relevance-only based measures must be replaced by measures that penalize the repetition of the same information in the system output across time.",
                "Thirdly, since the output of the system is ranked lists, we must reward those systems that present useful information (both relevant and previously unseen) using shorter ranked lists, and penalize those that present the same information using longer ranked lists.",
                "None of the existing measures in ad-hoc retrieval, adaptive filtering, novelty detection or other related areas (text summarization and question answering) have desirable properties in all the three aspects.",
                "Therefore, we must develop a new <br>evaluation methodology</br>. 4.1 Answer Keys To enable the evaluation of a system whose output consists of passages of arbitrary length, we borrow the concept of answer keys from the Question Answering (QA) community, where systems are allowed to return arbitrary spans of text as answers.",
                "Answer keys define what should be present in a system response to receive credit, and are comprised of a collection of information nuggets, i.e. factoid units about which human assessors can make binary decisions of whether or not a system response contains them.",
                "Defining answer keys and making the associated binary decisions are conceptual tasks that require semantic mapping [19], since system-returned passages can contain the same information expressed in many different ways.",
                "Hence, QA evaluations have relied on human assessors for the mapping between various expressions, making the process costly, time consuming, and not scalable to large query and document collections, and extensive system evaluations with various parameter settings. 4.1.1 Automating Evaluation based on Answer Keys Automatic evaluation methods would allow for faster system building and tuning, as well as provide an objective and affordable way of comparing various systems.",
                "Recently, such methods have been proposed, more or less, based on the idea of n-gram co-occurrences.",
                "Pourpre [10] assigns a fractional recall score to a system response based on its unigram overlap with a given nuggets description.",
                "For example, a system response A B C has recall 3/4 with respect to a nugget with description A B C D. However, such an approach is unfair to systems that present the same information but using words other than A, B, C, and D. Another open issue is how to weight individual words in measuring the closeness of a match.",
                "For example, consider the question How many prisoners escaped?.",
                "In the nugget Seven prisoners escaped from a Texas prison, there is no indication that seven is the keyword, and that it must be matched to get any relevance credit.",
                "Using IDF values does not help, since seven will generally not have a higher IDF than words like texas and prison.",
                "Also, redefining the nugget as just seven does not solve the problem since now it might spuriously match any mention of seven out of context.",
                "Nuggeteer [13] works on similar principles but makes binary decisions about whether a nugget is present in a given system response by tuning a threshold.",
                "However, it is also plagued by spurious relevance since not all words contained in the nugget description (or known correct responses) are central to the nugget. 4.1.2 Nugget-Matching Rules We propose a reliable automatic method for determining whether a snippet of text contains a given nugget, based on nugget-matching rules, which are generated using a semiautomatic procedure explained below.",
                "These rules are essentially Boolean queries that will only match against snippets that contain the nugget.",
                "For instance, a candidate rule for matching answers to How many prisoners escaped? is (Texas AND seven AND escape AND (convicts OR prisoners)), possibly with other synonyms and variants in the rule.",
                "For a corpus of news articles, which usually follow a typical formal prose, it is fairly easy to write such simple rules to match expected answers using a bootstrap approach, as described below.",
                "We propose a two-stage approach, inspired by Autoslog [14], that combines the strength of humans in identifying semantically equivalent expressions and the strength of the system in gathering statistical evidence from a humanannotated corpus of documents.",
                "In the first stage, human subjects annotated (using a highlighting tool) portions of ontopic documents that contained answers to each nugget 2 .",
                "In the second stage, subjects used our rule generation tool to create rules that would match the annotations for each nugget.",
                "The tool allows users to enter a Boolean rule as a disjunction of conjunctions (e.g. ((a AND b) OR (a AND c AND d) OR (e))).",
                "Given a candidate rule, our tool uses it as a Boolean query over the entire set of on-topic documents and calculates its recall and precision with respect to the annotations that it is expected to match.",
                "Hence, the subjects can start with a simple rule and iteratively refine it until they are satisfied with its recall and precision.",
                "We observed that it was very easy for humans to improve the precision of a rule by tweaking its existing conjunctions (adding more ANDs), and improving the recall by adding more conjunctions to the disjunction (adding more ORs).",
                "As an example, lets try to create a rule for the nugget which says that seven prisoners escaped from the Texas prison.",
                "We start with a simple rule - (seven).",
                "When we input this into the rule generation tool, we realize that this rule matches many spurious occurrences of seven (e.g. ...seven states...) and thus gets a low precision score.",
                "We can further qualify our rule - Texas AND seven AND convicts.",
                "Next, by looking at the missed annotations, we realize that some news articles mentioned ...seven prisoners escaped.... We then replace convicts with the disjunction (convicts OR prisoners).",
                "We continue tweaking the rule in this manner until we achieve a sufficiently high recall and precision - i.e. the (small number of) misses and false alarms can be safely ignored.",
                "Thus we can create nugget-matching rules that succinctly capture various ways of expressing a nugget, while avoiding matching incorrect (or out of context) responses.",
                "Human involvement in the rule creation process ensures high quality generic rules which can then be used to evaluate arbitrary system responses reliably. 4.2 Evaluating the Utility of a Sequence of Ranked Lists The utility of a retrieval system can be defined as the difference between how much the user gained in terms of useful information, and how much the user lost in terms of time and energy.",
                "We calculate this utility from the utilities of individual passages as follows.",
                "After reading each passage returned by the system, the user derives some gain depending on the presence of relevant and novel information, and incurs a loss in terms of the time and energy spent in going through the passage.",
                "However, the likelihood that the user would actually read a passage depends on its position in the ranked list.",
                "Hence, for a query q, the expected utility 2 LDC [18] already provides relevance judgments for 100 topics on the TDT4 corpus.",
                "We further ensured that these judgments are exhaustive on the entire corpus using pooling. of a passage pi at rank i can be defined as U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (4) where P(i) is the probability that the user would go through a passage at rank i.",
                "The expected utility for an entire ranked list of length n can be calculated simply by adding the expected utility of each passage: U(q) = nX i=1 P(i) ∗ (Gain(pi, q) − Loss(pi, q)) (5) Note that if we ignore the loss term and define P(i) as P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) then we get the recently popularized metric called Discounted Cumulated Gain (DCG) [9], where Gain(pi, q) is defined as the graded relevance of passage pi.",
                "However, without the loss term, DCG is a purely recall-oriented metric and not suitable for an adaptive filtering setting, where the systems utility depends in part on its ability to limit the number of items shown to the user.",
                "Although P(i) could be defined based on empirical studies of user behavior, for simplicity, we use P(i) exactly as defined in equation 6.",
                "The gain G(pi, q) of passage pi with respect to the query q is a function of - 1) the number of relevant nuggets present in pi, and 2) the novelty of each of these nuggets.",
                "We combine these two factors as follows.",

Combina las fortalezas y se extiende más allá del filtrado adaptativo convencional, la detección de novedades y la clasificación de pasajes no redundantes con respecto a las necesidades de información duraderas (tareas con múltiples consultas). Nuestro enfoque respalda la retroalimentación detallada del usuario a través del resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto, y aprovecha dicha información para la optimización de la utilidad en entornos adaptativos. Para nuestros experimentos, definimos tareas hipotéticas basadas en eventos de noticias en el corpus TDT4, con múltiples consultas por tarea. Se generaron claves de respuestas (nuggets) para cada consulta y se utilizó un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permiten emparejar automáticamente los nuggets con las respuestas del sistema. También proponemos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros resultados muestran mejoras alentadoras en la utilidad utilizando el nuevo enfoque, en comparación con los sistemas base sin aprendizaje incremental o componentes de detección de novedades.

INTRODUCCIÓN Seguir información nueva y relevante de flujos de datos temporales para usuarios con necesidades duraderas ha sido un tema de investigación desafiante en la recuperación de información. El filtrado adaptativo (AF) es una tarea de predicción en línea de la relevancia de cada nuevo documento con respecto a temas predefinidos. Basándose en la consulta inicial y algunos ejemplos positivos (si están disponibles), un sistema de AF mantiene un perfil para cada tema de interés, y lo actualiza constantemente según la retroalimentación del usuario. La naturaleza de aprendizaje incremental de los sistemas de AF los hace más poderosos que los motores de búsqueda estándar que admiten recuperación ad-hoc (por ejemplo. Google y Yahoo) en términos de encontrar información relevante con respecto a temas de interés duraderos, y más atractivo para los usuarios que están dispuestos a proporcionar retroalimentación para adaptar el sistema a sus necesidades de información específicas, sin tener que modificar sus consultas manualmente. Se han estudiado una variedad de algoritmos de aprendizaje supervisado (clasificadores de estilo Rocchio, modelos exponenciales-gaussianos, regresión local y enfoques de regresión logística) para entornos adaptativos, examinados con retroalimentación de relevancia explícita e implícita, y evaluados con respecto a la optimización de la utilidad en grandes colecciones de datos de referencia en los foros de TREC (Conferencias de Recuperación de Texto) y TDT (Detección y Seguimiento de Temas) [1, 4, 7, 15, 16, 20, 24, 23]. La regresión logística regularizada [21] se ha encontrado representativa para los enfoques de vanguardia, y altamente eficiente para adaptaciones frecuentes del modelo en grandes colecciones de documentos como el corpus TREC-10 (más de 800,000 documentos y 84 temas). A pesar de los logros sustanciales en la investigación reciente de filtrado adaptativo, aún quedan problemas significativos sin resolver sobre cómo aprovechar de manera efectiva y eficiente la retroalimentación del usuario. Específicamente, los siguientes problemas pueden limitar seriamente la verdadera utilidad de los sistemas de AF en aplicaciones del mundo real: 1. El usuario tiene un papel bastante pasivo en la configuración convencional de filtrado adaptativo: solo reacciona ante el sistema cuando este toma una decisión afirmativa sobre un documento, confirmando o rechazando esa decisión. Una alternativa más activa sería permitir al usuario emitir múltiples consultas sobre un tema, revisar una lista clasificada de documentos candidatos (o pasajes) por consulta, y proporcionar retroalimentación sobre la lista clasificada, refinando así su necesidad de información y solicitando listas clasificadas actualizadas. La última forma de interacción del usuario ha sido altamente efectiva en la recuperación estándar para consultas ad-hoc. Cómo implementar una estrategia para necesidades de información duraderas en entornos de FA es una pregunta abierta para la investigación. 2. La unidad para recibir un juicio de relevancia (sí o no) está restringida al nivel del documento en AF convencional. Sin embargo, un usuario real puede estar dispuesto a proporcionar comentarios más informativos y detallados resaltando algunas partes de texto en un documento recuperado como relevantes, en lugar de etiquetar todo el documento como relevante. Aprovechar de manera efectiva este tipo de retroalimentación detallada podría mejorar sustancialmente la calidad de un sistema de AF. Para esto, necesitamos habilitar el aprendizaje supervisado a partir de fragmentos de texto etiquetados de longitud arbitraria en lugar de solo permitir documentos etiquetados. 3. Los documentos seleccionados por el sistema suelen ser altamente redundantes. Un evento importante de noticias, por ejemplo, sería reportado por múltiples fuentes repetidamente durante un tiempo, haciendo que la mayor parte del contenido informativo en esos artículos sea redundante entre sí. Un sistema de AF convencional seleccionaría todas estas historias de noticias redundantes para la retroalimentación del usuario, desperdiciando el tiempo de los usuarios mientras ofrece poco beneficio. Claramente, las técnicas de detección de novedades pueden ayudar en principio [25, 2, 22] a mejorar la utilidad de los sistemas AF. Sin embargo, la efectividad de tales técnicas a nivel de pasaje para detectar novedad con respecto a la retroalimentación de los usuarios a nivel detallado y para detectar redundancia en listas clasificadas aún debe ser evaluada utilizando una medida de utilidad que imite las necesidades de un usuario real. Para abordar las limitaciones actuales de los sistemas de AF mencionadas anteriormente, proponemos y examinamos un nuevo enfoque en este artículo, que combina las fortalezas del AF convencional (aprendizaje incremental de modelos de temas), recuperación de pasajes multipase para consultas de larga duración condicionadas al tema, y detección de novedades para eliminar la redundancia de las interacciones del usuario con el sistema. Llamamos al nuevo proceso destilación de información basada en utilidad. Ten en cuenta que los corpus de referencia convencionales para evaluaciones de AF, que tienen juicios de relevancia a nivel de documento y no definen tareas con múltiples consultas, son insuficientes para evaluar el nuevo enfoque. Por lo tanto, ampliamos un corpus de referencia, la colección TDT4 de noticias y transmisiones de televisión, con definiciones de tareas, múltiples consultas por tarea y claves de respuestas por consulta. Hemos realizado nuestros experimentos en este corpus extendido TDT4 y hemos puesto a disposición del público los datos generados adicionalmente para futuras evaluaciones comparativas. Para evaluar automáticamente los fragmentos de texto arbitrarios devueltos por el sistema utilizando nuestras claves de respuestas, desarrollamos un esquema de evaluación con un procedimiento semiautomático para 1 URL: http://nyc.lti.cs.cmu.edu/downloads adquiriendo reglas que pueden comparar fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. Además, proponemos una extensión de NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain) [9] para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una función tanto de la relevancia como de la novedad. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La sección 2 describe el proceso de destilación de información con un ejemplo concreto. La sección 3 describe los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema llamado CAF´E - CMU Adaptive Filtering Engine. La sección 4 discute problemas con respecto a la <br>metodología de evaluación</br> y propone un nuevo esquema. La sección 5 describe el corpus extendido TDT4. La sección 6 presenta nuestros experimentos y resultados. La sección 7 concluye el estudio y ofrece perspectivas futuras. 2. Una TAREA DE EJEMPLO Considera un evento noticioso: la fuga de siete convictos de una prisión de Texas en diciembre de 2000 y su captura un mes después. Suponiendo que un usuario estuviera interesado en este evento desde sus primeras etapas, la necesidad de información podría ser: Encontrar información sobre la fuga de convictos de una prisión de Texas, y la información relacionada con su recaptura. Las preguntas de nivel inferior asociadas podrían ser: 1. ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? 2. ¿Dónde y cuándo fueron avistados? 3. ¿Quiénes son sus contactos conocidos dentro y fuera de la prisión? 4. ¿Cómo están armados? 5. ¿Tienen algún vehículo? 6. ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora? Llamamos a esta necesidad de información una tarea, y a las preguntas asociadas como las consultas en esta tarea. Un sistema de destilación debe monitorear los documentos entrantes, procesarlos por fragmentos en un orden temporal, seleccionar pasajes potencialmente relevantes y novedosos de cada fragmento con respecto a cada consulta, y presentar una lista clasificada de pasajes al usuario. La clasificación de pasajes aquí se basa en cuán relevante es un pasaje con respecto a la consulta actual, cuán novedoso es con respecto al historial actual del usuario (de sus interacciones con el sistema) y cuán redundante es en comparación con otros pasajes con un rango más alto en la lista. Cuando se le presenta una lista de pasajes, el usuario puede proporcionar retroalimentación resaltando tramos de texto arbitrarios que considere relevantes. Estos fragmentos de texto se toman como ejemplos positivos en la adaptación del perfil de consulta, y también se añaden al historial de los usuarios. Los pasajes no marcados por el usuario se consideran ejemplos negativos. Tan pronto como se actualiza el perfil de consulta, el sistema vuelve a realizar una búsqueda y devuelve otra lista clasificada de pasajes donde los pasajes previamente vistos son eliminados o clasificados como bajos, según la preferencia del usuario. Por ejemplo, si el usuario resalta ...los funcionarios han ofrecido una recompensa de $100,000 por su captura... como respuesta relevante a la consulta ¿Qué pasos se han tomado hasta ahora?, entonces la pieza resaltada se utiliza como un ejemplo de entrenamiento positivo adicional en la adaptación del perfil de la consulta. Este comentario también se añade al historial del usuario como un ejemplo visto, para que en el futuro, el sistema no coloque otro pasaje mencionando una recompensa de $100,000 en la parte superior de la lista clasificada. Sin embargo, un artículo que mencione que los funcionarios han duplicado el dinero de recompensa a $200,000 podría clasificarse alto ya que es relevante tanto para el perfil de consulta (actualizado) como novedoso con respecto a la historia del usuario (actualizada). El usuario puede modificar las consultas originales o agregar una nueva consulta durante el proceso; los perfiles de consulta se cambiarán en consecuencia. Claramente, la detección de novedades es muy importante para la utilidad de dicho sistema debido a la búsqueda iterativa. Sin detección de novedad, los antiguos pasajes relevantes se mostrarían al usuario repetidamente en cada lista clasificada. A través del ejemplo anterior, podemos ver las principales propiedades de nuestro nuevo marco de trabajo para la destilación de información basada en utilidad sobre documentos ordenados temporalmente. Nuestro marco de trabajo combina y amplía el poder del filtrado adaptativo (AF), la recuperación ad-hoc (IR) y la detección de novedades (ND). En comparación con la IR estándar, nuestro enfoque tiene la capacidad de aprender de forma incremental las necesidades de información a largo plazo y modelar una secuencia de consultas dentro de una tarea. En comparación con el AF convencional, permite un papel más activo del usuario en refinar sus necesidades de información y solicitar nuevos resultados al permitir comentarios sobre relevancia y novedad mediante el resaltado de fragmentos arbitrarios de texto en los pasajes devueltos por el sistema. Comparado con trabajos anteriores, esta es la primera evaluación de detección de novedad integrada con filtrado adaptativo para consultas secuenciadas que permite retroalimentación flexible del usuario sobre pasajes clasificados. La combinación de AF, IR y ND con las nuevas extensiones plantea una importante pregunta de investigación sobre la <br>metodología de evaluación</br>: ¿cómo podemos medir la utilidad de un sistema de destilación de información como este? Las métricas existentes en IR estándar, AF y ND son insuficientes, y se deben explorar nuevas soluciones, como discutiremos en la Sección 4, después de describir los núcleos técnicos de nuestro sistema en la próxima sección. 3. NÚCLEOS TÉCNICOS Los componentes principales de CAFÉ son: 1) AF para el aprendizaje incremental de perfiles de consulta, 2) IR para estimar la relevancia de pasajes con respecto a los perfiles de consulta, 3) ND para evaluar la novedad de pasajes con respecto al historial de usuarios, y 4) un componente anti-redundancia para eliminar la redundancia de las listas clasificadas. 3.1 Componente de Filtrado Adaptativo Utilizamos un algoritmo de vanguardia en el campo, el método de regresión logística regularizada que obtuvo los mejores resultados en varios corpus de evaluación de referencia para AF [21]. La regresión logística (LR) es un algoritmo de aprendizaje supervisado para clasificación estadística. Basándose en un conjunto de entrenamiento de instancias etiquetadas, aprende un modelo de clase que luego puede ser utilizado para predecir las etiquetas de instancias no vistas. Su rendimiento, así como su eficiencia en términos de tiempo de entrenamiento, lo convierten en un buen candidato cuando se requieren actualizaciones frecuentes del modelo de clase, como es el caso en el filtrado adaptativo, donde el sistema debe aprender de cada nueva retroalimentación proporcionada por el usuario. (Consulte [21] y [23] para complejidad computacional y problemas de implementación). En el filtrado adaptativo, cada consulta se considera como una clase y la probabilidad de que un pasaje pertenezca a esta clase corresponde al grado de relevancia del pasaje con respecto a la consulta. Para entrenar el modelo, utilizamos la propia consulta como ejemplo inicial de entrenamiento positivo de la clase, y las piezas de texto resaltadas por el usuario (marcadas como Relevante o No relevante) durante la retroalimentación como ejemplos de entrenamiento adicionales. Para abordar el problema de inicio en frío en la etapa inicial antes de obtener cualquier retroalimentación del usuario, el sistema utiliza una pequeña muestra de un corpus retrospectivo como ejemplos negativos iniciales en el conjunto de entrenamiento. Los detalles de cómo utilizar la regresión logística para el filtrado adaptativo (asignando diferentes pesos a las instancias de entrenamiento positivas y negativas, y regularizando la función objetivo para prevenir el sobreajuste en los datos de entrenamiento) se presentan en [21]. El modelo de clase w∗ aprendido por Regresión Logística, o el perfil de consulta, es un vector cuyas dimensiones son términos individuales y cuyos elementos son los coeficientes de regresión, indicando cuán influyente es cada término en el perfil de consulta. El perfil de la consulta se actualiza cada vez que se recibe una nueva pieza de retroalimentación del usuario. Un peso decaído temporalmente se puede aplicar a cada ejemplo de entrenamiento, como una opción, para enfatizar la retroalimentación más reciente del usuario. 3.2 Componente de Recuperación de Pasajes Utilizamos técnicas estándar de IR en esta parte de nuestro sistema. Los documentos entrantes se procesan por bloques, donde cada bloque puede definirse como un intervalo de tiempo fijo o como un número fijo de documentos, según lo prefiera el usuario. Para cada documento entrante, se actualizan las estadísticas del corpus como el IDF (Frecuencia Inversa de Documento) de cada término. Utilizamos un identificador y rastreador de entidades con tecnología de punta [8, 12] para identificar nombres de personas y lugares, y fusionarlos con entidades con referencia cruzada vistas en el pasado. Luego, los documentos se dividen en pasajes, que pueden ser un documento completo, un párrafo, una oración, o cualquier otro fragmento continuo de texto, según se prefiera. Cada pasaje se representa utilizando un vector de pesos TF-IDF (Frecuencia de Término - Frecuencia Inversa de Documento), donde el término puede ser una palabra o una entidad nombrada. Dado un perfil de consulta, es decir, la solución de regresión logística w∗ como se describe en la Sección 3.1, el sistema calcula la probabilidad posterior de relevancia para cada pasaje x como fRL(x) ≡ P(y = 1|x, w∗ ) = 1 (1 + e−w∗·x) (1). Los pasajes se ordenan según sus puntajes de relevancia, y aquellos con puntajes por encima de un umbral (ajustado en un conjunto de entrenamiento) conforman la lista de relevancia que se pasa al paso de detección de novedad. 3.3 Componente de Detección de Novedad CAF´E mantiene un historial de usuario H(t), que contiene todos los fragmentos de texto hi que el usuario resaltó (como retroalimentación) durante sus interacciones pasadas con el sistema, hasta el tiempo actual t. Denotando el historial como H(t) = n h1, h2, ..., ht o , (2), el puntaje de novedad de un nuevo pasaje candidato x se calcula como: fND(x) = 1 − max i∈1..t {cos(x, hi)} (3), donde tanto el pasaje candidato x como los fragmentos de texto resaltados hi se representan como vectores TF-IDF. El puntaje de novedad de cada pasaje se compara con un umbral predefinido (ajustado también en un conjunto de entrenamiento), y cualquier pasaje con un puntaje por debajo de este umbral se elimina de la lista de relevancia. Componente de clasificación anti-redundante Aunque el componente de detección de novedad garantiza que solo la información novedosa (no vista previamente) permanezca en la lista de relevancia, esta lista aún podría contener la misma información novedosa en múltiples posiciones en la lista clasificada. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que el usuario ya ha leído sobre una recompensa de $100,000 por información sobre los convictos fugados. Una nueva noticia de que el premio ha sido aumentado a $200,000 es novedosa ya que el usuario aún no la ha leído. Sin embargo, múltiples fuentes de noticias podrían informar sobre esta noticia y podríamos terminar mostrando artículos (redundantes) de todas estas fuentes en una lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, una lista clasificada también debe ser no redundante con respecto a su propio contenido. Utilizamos una versión simplificada del método de Máxima Relevancia Marginal [5], originalmente desarrollado para combinar relevancia y novedad en la recuperación de texto y resúmenes. Nuestro procedimiento comienza con la lista actual de pasajes ordenados por relevancia (sección 3.2), filtrados por el componente de Detección de Novedades (sección 3.3), y genera una nueva lista no redundante de la siguiente manera: 1. Toma el pasaje superior en la lista actual como el primero en la nueva lista. 2. Agrega el siguiente pasaje x en la lista actual a la nueva lista solo si fAR(x) > t donde fAR(x) = 1 − max pi∈Lnew {cos(x, pi)} y Lnew es el conjunto de pasajes ya seleccionados en la nueva lista. Repetir el paso 2 hasta que se hayan examinado todos los pasajes en la lista actual. Después de aplicar el algoritmo mencionado anteriormente, cada pasaje en la nueva lista es lo suficientemente diferente a los demás, favoreciendo así la diversidad en lugar de la redundancia en la nueva lista clasificada. El umbral anti-redundancia t se ajusta en un conjunto de entrenamiento. 4. METODOLOGÍA DE EVALUACIÓN El enfoque que propusimos anteriormente para la destilación de información plantea importantes cuestiones sobre la <br>metodología de evaluación</br>. En primer lugar, dado que nuestro marco de trabajo permite que la salida sean fragmentos en diferentes niveles de granularidad (por ejemplo, ventanas de k oraciones donde k puede variar) en lugar de una longitud fija, no es posible tener juicios de relevancia preanotados en todos esos niveles de granularidad. En segundo lugar, dado que deseamos medir la utilidad de la salida del sistema como una combinación de relevancia y novedad, las medidas tradicionales basadas únicamente en la relevancia deben ser reemplazadas por medidas que penalicen la repetición de la misma información en la salida del sistema a lo largo del tiempo. En tercer lugar, dado que la salida del sistema son listas clasificadas, debemos recompensar a aquellos sistemas que presenten información útil (tanto relevante como no vista previamente) utilizando listas clasificadas más cortas, y penalizar a aquellos que presenten la misma información utilizando listas clasificadas más largas. Ninguna de las medidas existentes en la recuperación ad-hoc, filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades u otras áreas relacionadas (resumen de texto y respuesta a preguntas) tiene propiedades deseables en los tres aspectos. Por lo tanto, debemos desarrollar una nueva <br>metodología de evaluación</br>. 4.1 Claves de Respuesta Para permitir la evaluación de un sistema cuya salida consiste en pasajes de longitud arbitraria, tomamos prestado el concepto de claves de respuesta de la comunidad de Preguntas y Respuestas (QA), donde los sistemas pueden devolver fragmentos de texto arbitrarios como respuestas. Las claves de respuestas definen lo que debe estar presente en la respuesta de un sistema para recibir crédito, y están compuestas por una colección de \"nuggets\" de información, es decir, unidades de datos sobre las cuales los evaluadores humanos pueden tomar decisiones binarias sobre si una respuesta del sistema las contiene o no. La definición de claves de respuestas y la toma de decisiones binarias asociadas son tareas conceptuales que requieren un mapeo semántico [19], ya que los pasajes devueltos por el sistema pueden contener la misma información expresada de muchas formas diferentes. Por lo tanto, las evaluaciones de QA han dependido de evaluadores humanos para la correspondencia entre diversas expresiones, lo que hace que el proceso sea costoso, consume mucho tiempo y no sea escalable para grandes colecciones de consultas y documentos, y evaluaciones extensas de sistemas con diversos ajustes de parámetros. 4.1.1 Automatización de la evaluación basada en claves de respuestas Los métodos de evaluación automática permitirían una construcción y ajuste más rápidos del sistema, así como proporcionar una forma objetiva y asequible de comparar diversos sistemas. Recientemente, se han propuesto métodos basados más o menos en la idea de las co-ocurrencias de n-gramos. Pourpre [10] asigna una puntuación de recuerdo fraccional a una respuesta del sistema basada en su superposición de unigramas con una descripción de pepitas dada. Por ejemplo, una respuesta del sistema A B C tiene una recuperación de 3/4 con respecto a un fragmento con la descripción A B C D. Sin embargo, este enfoque es injusto para los sistemas que presentan la misma información pero utilizando palabras distintas a A, B, C y D. Otro problema abierto es cómo ponderar las palabras individuales al medir la cercanía de una coincidencia. Por ejemplo, considera la pregunta ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? En el fragmento Siete prisioneros escaparon de una prisión de Texas, no hay indicación de que siete sea la palabra clave y que debe coincidir para obtener algún crédito de relevancia. El uso de los valores de IDF no ayuda, ya que la palabra \"seven\" generalmente no tendrá un IDF más alto que palabras como \"texas\" y \"prison\". Además, redefinir el fragmento como simplemente siete no resuelve el problema, ya que ahora podría coincidir erróneamente con cualquier mención de siete fuera de contexto. Nuggeteer [13] trabaja sobre principios similares pero toma decisiones binarias sobre si hay un fragmento en una respuesta de sistema dada ajustando un umbral. Sin embargo, también está plagado de relevancia espuria ya que no todas las palabras contenidas en la descripción de la pepita (o respuestas correctas conocidas) son centrales para la pepita. 4.1.2 Reglas de Coincidencia de Pepitas Proponemos un método automático confiable para determinar si un fragmento de texto contiene una pepita dada, basado en reglas de coincidencia de pepitas, que se generan utilizando un procedimiento semiautomático explicado a continuación. Estas reglas son básicamente consultas booleanas que solo coincidirán con fragmentos que contengan la pepita. Por ejemplo, una regla candidata para emparejar respuestas a ¿Cuántos prisioneros escaparon? es (Texas Y siete Y escapar Y (convictos O prisioneros)), posiblemente con otros sinónimos y variantes en la regla. Para un corpus de artículos de noticias, que suelen seguir una prosa formal típica, es bastante fácil escribir reglas simples para coincidir con respuestas esperadas utilizando un enfoque de arranque, como se describe a continuación. Proponemos un enfoque de dos etapas, inspirado en Autoslog [14], que combina la capacidad de los humanos para identificar expresiones semánticamente equivalentes y la capacidad del sistema para recopilar evidencia estadística de un corpus de documentos anotados por humanos. En la primera etapa, los sujetos humanos anotaron (utilizando una herramienta de resaltado) porciones de documentos relevantes que contenían respuestas a cada fragmento 2. En la segunda etapa, los sujetos utilizaron nuestra herramienta de generación de reglas para crear reglas que coincidieran con las anotaciones de cada fragmento. La herramienta permite a los usuarios ingresar una regla booleana como una disyunción de conjunciones (por ejemplo, ((a Y b) O (a Y c Y d) O (e))). Dada una regla candidata, nuestra herramienta la utiliza como una consulta booleana sobre el conjunto completo de documentos relevantes y calcula su recall y precisión con respecto a las anotaciones que se espera que coincida. Por lo tanto, los sujetos pueden comenzar con una regla simple y refinarla iterativamente hasta que estén satisfechos con su precisión y recuperación. Observamos que era muy fácil para los humanos mejorar la precisión de una regla ajustando sus conjunciones existentes (agregando más Y) y mejorar la recuperación agregando más conjunciones a la disyunción (agregando más O). Como ejemplo, intentemos crear una regla para el acertijo que dice que siete prisioneros escaparon de la prisión de Texas. Empezamos con una regla simple - (siete). Cuando introducimos esto en la herramienta de generación de reglas, nos damos cuenta de que esta regla coincide con muchas ocurrencias espurias de siete (por ejemplo, ...siete estados...) y, por lo tanto, obtiene una puntuación baja de precisión. Podemos calificar aún más nuestra regla - Texas Y siete Y convictos. A continuación, al revisar las anotaciones omitidas, nos damos cuenta de que algunos artículos de noticias mencionaban ...siete prisioneros escaparon.... Luego reemplazamos convictos por la disyunción (convictos O prisioneros). Continuamos ajustando la regla de esta manera hasta lograr un nivel de recordación y precisión suficientemente alto, es decir, que los (pocos) errores y alarmas falsas se puedan ignorar de forma segura. Así podemos crear reglas de coincidencia de pepitas que capturen de manera sucinta varias formas de expresar una pepita, evitando al mismo tiempo emparejar respuestas incorrectas (o fuera de contexto). La participación humana en el proceso de creación de reglas garantiza reglas genéricas de alta calidad que luego se pueden utilizar para evaluar de manera confiable las respuestas del sistema arbitrario. 4.2 Evaluación de la Utilidad de una Secuencia de Listas Clasificadas La utilidad de un sistema de recuperación se puede definir como la diferencia entre cuánta información útil obtuvo el usuario y cuánto tiempo y energía perdió. Calculamos esta utilidad a partir de las utilidades de los pasajes individuales de la siguiente manera. Después de leer cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema, el usuario obtiene cierta ganancia dependiendo de la presencia de información relevante y novedosa, y incurre en una pérdida en términos del tiempo y la energía invertidos en revisar el pasaje. Sin embargo, la probabilidad de que el usuario realmente lea un pasaje depende de su posición en la lista clasificada. Por lo tanto, para una consulta q, la utilidad esperada 2 LDC [18] ya proporciona juicios de relevancia para 100 temas en el corpus TDT4. Además, nos aseguramos de que estos juicios sean exhaustivos en todo el corpus utilizando la agrupación. El valor de un pasaje pi en el rango i se puede definir como U(pi, q) = P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) - Pérdida(pi, q)) (4) donde P(i) es la probabilidad de que el usuario pase por un pasaje en el rango i. La utilidad esperada para una lista clasificada completa de longitud n se puede calcular simplemente sumando la utilidad esperada de cada pasaje: U(q) = Σ i=1 P(i) ∗ (Ganancia(pi, q) − Pérdida(pi, q)) (5) Nótese que si ignoramos el término de pérdida y definimos P(i) como P(i) ∝ 1/ logb(b + i − 1) (6) entonces obtenemos la métrica recientemente popularizada llamada Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG) [9], donde Ganancia(pi, q) se define como la relevancia graduada del pasaje pi. Sin embargo, sin el término de pérdida, DCG es una métrica puramente orientada al recuerdo y no es adecuada para un entorno de filtrado adaptativo, donde la utilidad del sistema depende en parte de su capacidad para limitar el número de elementos mostrados al usuario. Aunque P(i) podría definirse en base a estudios empíricos del comportamiento del usuario, por simplicidad, utilizamos P(i) tal como se define exactamente en la ecuación 6. La ganancia G(pi, q) del pasaje pi con respecto a la consulta q es una función de - 1) el número de pepitas relevantes presentes en pi, y 2) la novedad de cada una de estas pepitas. Combinamos estos dos factores de la siguiente manera. Para cada pepita Nj, asignamos un peso inicial wj, y también mantenemos un conteo nj del número de veces que esta pepita ha sido vista por el usuario en el pasado. La ganancia derivada de cada ocurrencia posterior del mismo hallazgo se asume que se reduce por un factor de amortiguamiento γ. Por lo tanto, G(pi, q) se define como G(pi, q) = X Nj ∈C(pi,q) wj ∗ γnj (7) donde C(pi, q) es el conjunto de todas las pepitas que aparecen en el pasaje pi y también pertenecen a la clave de respuesta de la consulta q. Los pesos iniciales wj se establecen todos en 1.0 en nuestros experimentos, pero también pueden establecerse según un enfoque de pirámide [11]. La elección del factor de amortiguación γ determina la tolerancia del usuario a la redundancia. Cuando γ = 0, un pepita solo recibirá crédito por su primera ocurrencia, es decir, cuando nj sea cero. Para 0 < γ < 1, un nugget recibe menos crédito por cada ocurrencia sucesiva. Cuando γ = 1, no se produce amortiguamiento y las repeticiones de un valor reciben el mismo crédito. Se debe tener en cuenta que los recuentos de ocurrencia de las pepitas se conservan entre la evaluación de las listas clasificadas sucesivas devueltas por el sistema, ya que se espera que los usuarios recuerden lo que el sistema les mostró en el pasado. Definimos la pérdida L(pi, q) como un costo constante c (usamos 0.1) incurrido al leer un pasaje devuelto por el sistema. Por lo tanto, nuestra métrica puede ser reescrita como U(q) = nX i=1 Ganancia(pi, q) logb(b + i − 1) − L(n) (8) donde L(n) es la pérdida asociada con una lista clasificada de longitud n: L(n) = c · nX i=1 1 logb(b + i − 1) (9) 3 Nótese que 00 = 1 Debido a la similitud con la Ganancia Acumulada Descontada (DCG), llamamos a nuestra métrica Utilidad Acumulada Descontada (DCU). El puntaje de DCU obtenido por el sistema se convierte en un puntaje de DCU normalizado (NDCU) dividiéndolo por el puntaje de DCU de la lista ideal clasificada, que se crea ordenando los pasajes por sus puntajes de utilidad decrecientes U(pi, q) y deteniéndose cuando U(pi, q) ≤ 0, es decir, cuando la ganancia es menor o igual al costo de leer el pasaje. El conjunto de datos TDT4 fue el corpus de referencia utilizado en las evaluaciones TDT2002 y TDT2003. El corpus consiste en más de 90,000 artículos de noticias de múltiples fuentes (AP, NYT, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Xinhua, Zaobao, Voice of America, PRI the World, etc.) publicados entre octubre de 2000 y enero de 2001, en los idiomas árabe, inglés y mandarín. Las versiones de los artículos en otros idiomas reconocidas por voz y traducidas por máquina también fueron proporcionadas. LDC [18] ha anotado el corpus con 100 temas, que corresponden a varios eventos de noticias en este período de tiempo. De entre estos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de 12 eventos accionables y definimos tareas correspondientes para ellos. Para cada tarea, definimos manualmente un perfil que consiste en un conjunto inicial de (5 a 10) consultas, una descripción de texto libre del historial del usuario, es decir, lo que el usuario ya sabe sobre el evento, y una lista de documentos conocidos relevantes y no relevantes (si están disponibles) como ejemplos de entrenamiento. Para cada consulta, generamos claves de respuestas y reglas de coincidencia de pepitas correspondientes utilizando el procedimiento descrito en la sección 4.1.2, y produjimos un total de 120 consultas, con un promedio de 7 pepitas por consulta. EXPERIMENTOS Y RESULTADOS 6.1 Baselines Utilizamos Indri [17], un motor de búsqueda basado en modelos de lenguaje popular, como referencia para comparar con CAFÉ. Indri admite la funcionalidad estándar de los motores de búsqueda, incluido el feedback de pseudo-relevancia (PRF) [3, 6], y es representativo de un sistema de recuperación basado en consultas típico. Indri no admite ningún tipo de detección de novedades. Comparamos Indri con PRF activado y desactivado, frente a CAFÉ con retroalimentación del usuario, detección de novedades y clasificación antirredundante activados y desactivados. 6.2 Configuración Experimental Dividimos el corpus TDT4 que abarca 4 meses en 10 fragmentos, cada uno definido como un período de 12 días consecutivos. En cualquier momento dado del proceso de destilación, cada sistema accedía a los datos pasados hasta el punto actual, y devolvía una lista clasificada de hasta 50 pasajes por consulta. Las 12 tareas definidas en el corpus se dividieron en un conjunto de entrenamiento y prueba con 6 tareas cada uno. Cada sistema pudo utilizar el conjunto de entrenamiento para ajustar sus parámetros con el fin de optimizar NDCU (ecuación 8), incluyendo el umbral de relevancia tanto para Indri como para CAF´E, y los umbrales de novedad y antirredundancia para CAF´E. La NDCU para cada ejecución del sistema se calcula automáticamente. También se simuló la retroalimentación de los usuarios: los juicios de relevancia para cada pasaje devuelto por el sistema (según las reglas de coincidencia de pepitas descritas en la sección 4.1.2) fueron utilizados como retroalimentación de los usuarios en la adaptación de perfiles de consulta e historiales de usuario. En la Tabla 1, mostramos los puntajes NDCU de los dos sistemas en diferentes configuraciones. Estas puntuaciones se promedian en las seis tareas del conjunto de pruebas, y se calculan con dos factores de amortiguación (ver sección 4.2): γ = 0 y 0.1, para simular ninguna tolerancia y poca tolerancia para la redundancia, respectivamente. Usar γ = 0 crea una métrica mucho más estricta ya que no otorga ningún crédito a un pasaje que contenga información relevante pero redundante. Por lo tanto, la mejora obtenida al habilitar la retroalimentación del usuario es menor con γ = 0 que la mejora obtenida de la retroalimentación con γ = 0.1. Esto revela una deficiencia de los sistemas de recuperación contemporáneos: cuando el usuario da retroalimentación positiva sobre un pasaje, los sistemas otorgan mayor peso a los términos presentes en ese pasaje y tienden a recuperar otros pasajes que contienen los mismos términos, y por lo tanto, generalmente la misma información. Sin embargo, el usuario no se beneficia al ver pasajes redundantes y generalmente está interesado en otros pasajes que contengan información relacionada. Es informativo evaluar los sistemas de recuperación utilizando nuestra medida de utilidad (con γ = 0) que tiene en cuenta la novedad y, por lo tanto, ofrece una imagen más realista de cuán bien un sistema puede generalizar a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario, en lugar de utilizar medidas tradicionales de RI como la recuperación y la precisión, que ofrecen una imagen incompleta de la mejora obtenida a partir de la retroalimentación del usuario. A veces, sin embargo, los usuarios podrían estar interesados en ver la misma información de múltiples fuentes, como un indicador de su importancia o fiabilidad. En tal caso, simplemente podemos elegir un valor más alto para γ que corresponda a una mayor tolerancia para la redundancia, y así permitir que el sistema ajuste sus parámetros en consecuencia. Dado que los documentos fueron procesados por fragmentos, sería interesante ver cómo mejora el rendimiento de los sistemas con el tiempo. Las figuras 1 y 2 muestran las tendencias de rendimiento de ambos sistemas a lo largo de los fragmentos. Si bien se espera que el rendimiento con y sin retroalimentación en los primeros fragmentos sea similar, para los fragmentos posteriores, la curva de rendimiento con la retroalimentación habilitada supera a la del ajuste sin retroalimentación. Las tendencias de rendimiento no son consistentes en todos los fragmentos porque los documentos relevantes no están distribuidos uniformemente en todos los fragmentos, lo que hace que algunas consultas sean más fáciles que otras en ciertos fragmentos. Además, dado que Indri utiliza retroalimentación de pseudo-relevancia mientras que CAF´E utiliza retroalimentación basada en juicios de relevancia reales, la mejora en el caso de Indri es menos dramática que la de CAF´E. 7. CONCLUSIONES FINALES Este artículo presenta la primera investigación sobre la destilación de información basada en la utilidad con un sistema que aprende las necesidades de información duraderas a partir de la retroalimentación detallada del usuario sobre una secuencia de pasajes clasificados. Nuestro sistema, llamado CAF´E, combina filtrado adaptativo, detección de novedades y clasificación de pasajes antirredundantes en un marco unificado para la optimización de la utilidad. Desarrollamos un nuevo esquema para la evaluación y retroalimentación automatizadas basado en un procedimiento semiautomático para adquirir reglas que permitan emparejar automáticamente fragmentos con las respuestas del sistema. También propusimos una extensión de la métrica NDCG para evaluar la utilidad de los pasajes clasificados como una combinación ponderada de relevancia y novedad. Nuestros experimentos en el recién anotado corpus de referencia TDT4 muestran un alentador aumento de utilidad sobre Indri, y también sobre nuestro propio sistema con aprendizaje incremental y detección de novedades desactivados. 8.
