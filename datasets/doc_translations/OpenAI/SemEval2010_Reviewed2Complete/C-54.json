However, interactive work with such large volumes of online spatial data is a challenging task. We propose two efficient approaches to remote access to large spatial data. First, we introduce a client-server architecture where the work is distributed between the server and the individual clients for spatial query evaluation, data visualization, and data management. We enable the minimization of the requirements for system resources on the client side while maximizing system responsiveness as well as the number of connections one server can handle concurrently. Second, for prolonged periods of access to large online data, we introduce APPOINT (an Approach for Peer-to-Peer Oﬄoading the INTernet). This is a centralized peer-to-peer approach that helps Internet users transfer large volumes of online data efficiently. In APPOINT, active clients of the clientserver architecture act on the servers behalf and communicate with each other to decrease network latency, improve service bandwidth, and resolve server congestions.

INTRODUCTION In recent years, enterprises in the public and private sectors have provided access to large volumes of spatial data over the Internet. Interactive work with such large volumes of online spatial data is a challenging task. We have been developing an interactive browser for accessing spatial online databases: the SAND (Spatial and Non-spatial Data) Internet Browser. Users of this browser can interactively and visually manipulate spatial data remotely. Unfortunately, interactive remote access to spatial data slows to a crawl without proper data access mechanisms. We developed two separate methods for improving the system performance, together, form a dynamic network infrastructure that is highly scalable and provides a satisfactory user experience for interactions with large volumes of online spatial data. The core functionality responsible for the actual database operations is performed by the server-based SAND system. SAND is a spatial database system developed at the University of Maryland [12]. The client-side SAND Internet Browser provides a graphical user interface to the facilities of SAND over the Internet. Users specify queries by choosing the desired selection conditions from a variety of menus and dialog boxes. SAND Internet Browser is Java-based, which makes it deployable across many platforms. In addition, since Java has often been installed on target computers beforehand, our clients can be deployed on these systems with little or no need for any additional software installation or customization. The system can start being utilized immediately without any prior setup which can be extremely beneficial in time-sensitive usage scenarios such as emergencies. There are two ways to deploy SAND. First, any standard Web browser can be used to retrieve and run the client piece (SAND Internet Browser) as a Java application or an applet. This way, users across various platforms can continuously access large spatial data on a remote location with little or 15 no need for any preceding software installation. The second option is to use a stand-alone SAND Internet Browser along with a locally-installed Internet-enabled database management system (server piece). In this case, the SAND Internet Browser can still be utilized to view data from remote locations. However, frequently accessed data can be downloaded to the local database on demand, and subsequently accessed locally. Power users can also upload large volumes of spatial data back to the remote server using this enhanced client. We focused our efforts in two directions. We first aimed at developing a client-server architecture with efficient caching methods to balance local resources on one side and the significant latency of the network connection on the other. The low bandwidth of this connection is the primary concern in both cases. The outcome of this research primarily addresses the issues of our first type of usage (i.e., as a remote browser application or an applet) for our browser and other similar applications. The second direction aims at helping users that wish to manipulate large volumes of online data for prolonged periods. We have developed a centralized peerto-peer approach to provide the users with the ability to transfer large volumes of data (i.e., whole data sets to the local database) more efficiently by better utilizing the distributed network resources among active clients of a clientserver architecture. We call this architecture APPOINTApproach for Peer-to-Peer Oﬄoading the INTernet. The results of this research addresses primarily the issues of the second type of usage for our SAND Internet Browser (i.e., as a stand-alone application). The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our client-server approach in more detail. Section 3 focuses on APPOINT, our peer-to-peer approach. Section 4 discusses our work in relation to existing work. Section 5 outlines a sample SAND Internet Browser scenario for both of our remote access approaches. Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2. THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products. The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried. This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them. There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable. In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet). These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system. Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine. Our client is more than a simple image viewer. Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally. In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client. This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server. This is a concept similar to caching. In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed. It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally. Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning. In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database. This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services. Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client. All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display. However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel. In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side. This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client. It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language. Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel. After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client. Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection. It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic. When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries. The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query. The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format. It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution. The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query). If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server. In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client. The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed. Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly. In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database. The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3. THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time. In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session. Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large. A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl. This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server). We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems. A server still exists. There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service. The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances. Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients. This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc. When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme). The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests. In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service. The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision. The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service. Data is assumed to be formed of files. A single file forms the atomic means of communication. APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests. Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users. This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it. Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited. Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times. The service depends on the availability of the server. The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable. Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers. If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken. In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability. The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server. Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data. For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized. Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location. Eventually the data is propagated to the server. All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients. Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space. The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact. APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers. This achieves platform independence and easy deployment of the system. APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures. We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service. We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server. With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily. Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately. The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method. This will enable APPOINT to treat the server as one of the peers. The two callback methods of the server are invoked when a file is received from a client, or when an error is encountered while receiving a file from a client. APPOINT guar7 Figure 2: The localization operation in APPOINT. antees that at least one of the callbacks will be called so that the user (who may not be online anymore) can always be notified (i.e., via email). Clients localizing large data files can make these files available to the public by using the makeFileAvailable method on the client side. For example, in our SAND Internet Browser, we have the localization of spatial data as a function that can be chosen from our menus. This functionality enables users to download data sets completely to their local disks before starting their queries or analysis. In our implementation, we have calls to the APPOINT service both on the client and the server sides as mentioned above. Hence, when a localization request comes to the SAND Internet Browser, the browser leaves the decisions to optimally find and localize a data set to the APPOINT service. Our server also makes its data files available over APPOINT. The mechanism for the localization operation is shown with more details from the APPOINT protocols in Figure 2. The upload operation is performed in a similar fashion. 4. RELATED WORK There has been a substantial amount of research on remote access to spatial data. One specific approach has been adopted by numerous Web-based mapping services (MapQuest [5], MapsOnUs [6], etc.). The goal in this approach is to enable remote users, typically only equipped with standard Web browsers, to access the companys spatial database server and retrieve information in the form of pictorial maps from them. The solution presented by most of these vendors is based on performing all the calculations on the server side and transferring only bitmaps that represent results of user queries and commands. Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client). Work described in [9] examines a client-server architecture for viewing large images that operates over a lowbandwidth network connection. It presents a technique based on wavelet transformations that allows the minimization of the amount of data needed to be transferred over the network between the server and the client. In this case, while the server holds the full representation of the large image, only a limited amount of data needs to be transferred to the client to enable it to display a currently requested view into the image. On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations. Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested. This also allows dropping unnecessary parts of the image from the main memory on the server. Other related work has been reported in [16] where a client-server architecture is described that is designed to provide end users with access to a server. It is assumed that this data server manages vast databases that are impractical to be stored on individual clients. This work blends raster data management (stored in pyramids [22]) with vector data stored in quadtrees [19, 20]. For our peer-to-peer transfer approach (APPOINT), Napster is the forefather where a directory service is centralized on a server and users exchange music files that they have stored on their local disks. Our application domain, where the data is already freely available to the public, forms a prime candidate for such a peer-to-peer approach. Gnutella is a pure (decentralized) peer-to-peer file exchange system. Unfortunately, it suffers from scalability issues, i.e., floods of messages between peers in order to map connectivity in the system are required. Other systems followed these popular systems, each addressing a different flavor of sharing over the Internet. Many peer-to-peer storage systems have also recently emerged. PAST [18], Eternity Service [7], CFS [10], and OceanStore [15] are some peer-to-peer storage systems. Some of these systems have focused on anonymity while others have focused on persistence of storage. Also, other approaches, like SETI@Home [21], made other resources, such as idle CPUs, work together over the Internet to solve large scale computational problems. Our goal is different than these approaches. With APPOINT, we want to improve existing client-server systems in terms of performance by using idle networking resources among active clients. Hence, other issues like anonymity, decentralization, and persistence of storage were less important in our decisions. Confirming the authenticity of the indirectly delivered data sets is not yet addressed with APPOINT. We want to expand our research, in the future, to address this issue. From our perspective, although APPOINT employs some of the techniques used in peer-to-peer systems, it is also closely related to current Web caching architectures. Squirrel [13] forms the middle ground. It creates a pure peer-topeer collaborative Web cache among the Web browser caches of the machines in a local-area network. Except for this recent peer-to-peer approach, Web caching is mostly a wellstudied topic in the realm of server/proxy level caching [8, 11, 14, 17]. Collaborative Web caching systems, the most relevant of these for our research, focus on creating either a hierarchical, hash-based, central directory-based, or multicast-based caching schemes. We do not compete with these approaches. In fact, APPOINT can work in tandem with collaborative Web caching if they are deployed together. We try to address the situation where a request arrives at a server, meaning all the caches report a miss. Hence, the point where the server is reached can be used to take a central decision but then the actual service request can be forwarded to a set of active clients, i.e., the down8 load and upload operations. Cache misses are especially common in the type of large data-based services on which we are working. Most of the Web caching schemes that are in use today employ a replacement policy that gives a priority to replacing the largest sized items over smaller-sized ones. Hence, these policies would lead to the immediate replacement of our relatively large data files even though they may be used frequently. In addition, in our case, the user community that accesses a certain data file may also be very dispersed from a network point of view and thus cannot take advantage of any of the caching schemes. Finally, none of the Web caching methods address the symmetric issue of large data uploads. 5. A SAMPLE APPLICATION FedStats [1] is an online source that enables ordinary citizens access to official statistics of numerous federal agencies without knowing in advance which agency produced them. We are using a FedStats data set as a testbed for our work. Our goal is to provide more power to the users of FedStats by utilizing the SAND Internet Browser. As an example, we looked at two data files corresponding to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-regulated facilities that have chlorine and arsenic, respectively. For each file, we had the following information available: EPA-ID, name, street, city, state, zip code, latitude, longitude, followed by flags to indicate if that facility is in the following EPA programs: Hazardous Waste, Wastewater Discharge, Air Emissions, Abandoned Toxic Waste Dump, and Active Toxic Release. We put this data into a SAND relation where the spatial attribute location corresponds to the latitude and longitude. Some queries that can be handled with our system on this data include: 1. Find all EPA-regulated facilities that have arsenic and participate in the Air Emissions program, and: (a) Lie in Georgia to Illinois, alphabetically. (b) Lie within Arkansas or 30 miles within its border. (c) Lie within 30 miles of the border of Arkansas (i.e., both sides of the border). 2. For each EPA-regulated facility that has arsenic, find all EPA-regulated facilities that have chlorine and: (a) That are closer to it than to any other EPAregulated facility that has arsenic. (b) That participate in the Air Emissions program and are closer to it than to any other EPAregulated facility which has arsenic. In order to avoid reporting a particular facility more than once, we use our group by EPA-ID mechanism. Figure 3 illustrates the output of an example query that finds all arsenic sites within a given distance of the border of Arkansas. The sites are obtained in an incremental manner with respect to a given point. This ordering is shown by using different color shades. With this example data, it is possible to work with the SAND Internet Browser online as an applet (connecting to a remote server) or after localizing the data and then opening it locally. In the first case, for each action taken, the client-server architecture will decide what to ask for from the server. In the latter case, the browser will use the peerto-peer APPOINT architecture for first localizing the data. 6. CONCLUDING REMARKS An overview of our efforts in providing remote access to large spatial data has been given. We have outlined our approaches and introduced their individual elements. Our client-server approach improves the system performance by using efficient caching methods when a remote server is accessed from thin-clients. APPOINT forms an alternative approach that improves performance under an existing clientserver system by using idle client resources when individual users want work on a data set for longer periods of time using their client computers. For the future, we envision development of new efficient algorithms that will support large online data transfers within our peer-to-peer approach using multiple peers simultaneously. We assume that a peer (client) can become unavailable at any anytime and hence provisions need to be in place to handle such a situation. To address this, we will augment our methods to include efficient dynamic updates. Upon completion of this step of our work, we also plan to run comprehensive performance studies on our methods. Another issue is how to access data from different sources in different formats. In order to access multiple data sources in real time, it is desirable to look for a mechanism that would support data exchange by design. The XML protocol [3] has emerged to become virtually a standard for describing and communicating arbitrary data. GML [4] is an XML variant that is becoming increasingly popular for exchange of geographical data. We are currently working on making SAND XML-compatible so that the user can instantly retrieve spatial data provided by various agencies in the GML format via their Web services and then explore, query, or process this data further within the SAND framework. This will turn the SAND system into a universal tool for accessing any spatial data set as it will be deployable on most platforms, work efficiently given large amounts of data, be able to tap any GML-enabled data source, and provide an easy to use graphical user interface. This will also convert the SAND system from a research-oriented prototype into a product that could be used by end users for accessing, viewing, and analyzing their data efficiently and with minimum effort. 7.

Introducción En los últimos años, las empresas en los sectores público y privado han proporcionado acceso a grandes volúmenes de datos espaciales a través de Internet. El trabajo interactivo con volúmenes tan grandes de datos espaciales en línea es una tarea desafiante. Hemos estado desarrollando un navegador interactivo para acceder a bases de datos en línea espaciales: el navegador de Internet de arena (datos espaciales y no espaciales). Los usuarios de este navegador pueden manipular de manera interactiva y visual los datos espaciales de forma remota. Desafortunadamente, el acceso remoto interactivo a los datos espaciales se ralentiza a un rastreo sin los mecanismos de acceso de datos adecuados. Desarrollamos dos métodos separados para mejorar el rendimiento del sistema, juntos, forman una infraestructura de red dinámica que es altamente escalable y proporciona una experiencia de usuario satisfactoria para las interacciones con grandes volúmenes de datos espaciales en línea. El sistema de arena basado en el servidor realiza la funcionalidad central responsable de las operaciones de la base de datos reales. Sand es un sistema de base de datos espacial desarrollado en la Universidad de Maryland [12]. El navegador de Internet de Sand del lado del cliente proporciona una interfaz gráfica de usuario a las instalaciones de Sand a través de Internet. Los usuarios especifican consultas eligiendo las condiciones de selección deseadas de una variedad de menús y cuadros de diálogo. Sand Internet Browser está basado en Java, lo que lo hace desplegable en muchas plataformas. Además, dado que Java a menudo se ha instalado en las computadoras de destino de antemano, nuestros clientes se pueden implementar en estos sistemas con poca o ninguna necesidad de instalación o personalización de software adicional. El sistema puede comenzar a utilizarse inmediatamente sin ninguna configuración previa que pueda ser extremadamente beneficiosa en escenarios de uso sensibles al tiempo, como emergencias. Hay dos formas de desplegar arena. Primero, cualquier navegador web estándar se puede utilizar para recuperar y ejecutar la pieza del cliente (navegador de Internet de arena) como una aplicación Java o un applet. De esta manera, los usuarios en varias plataformas pueden acceder continuamente a los datos espaciales grandes en una ubicación remota con poca o 15 sin necesidad de ninguna instalación de software anterior. La segunda opción es utilizar un navegador de Internet de arena independiente junto con un sistema de administración de bases de datos habilitado para Internet instalado localmente (pieza del servidor). En este caso, el navegador Sand Internet aún se puede utilizar para ver datos de ubicaciones remotas. Sin embargo, los datos de acceso frecuente se pueden descargar a la base de datos local a pedido, y posteriormente se accede localmente. Los usuarios propios también pueden cargar grandes volúmenes de datos espaciales al servidor remoto utilizando este cliente mejorado. Centramos nuestros esfuerzos en dos direcciones. Primero tenía como objetivo desarrollar una arquitectura de cliente cliente con métodos de almacenamiento de almacenamiento eficientes para equilibrar los recursos locales en un lado y la latencia significativa de la conexión de red por el otro. El bajo ancho de banda de esta conexión es la principal preocupación en ambos casos. El resultado de esta investigación aborda principalmente los problemas de nuestro primer tipo de uso (es decir, como una aplicación de navegador remoto o un applet) para nuestro navegador y otras aplicaciones similares. La segunda dirección tiene como objetivo ayudar a los usuarios que desean manipular grandes volúmenes de datos en línea por períodos prolongados. Hemos desarrollado un enfoque centralizado de peerto para proporcionar a los usuarios la capacidad de transferir grandes volúmenes de datos (es decir, conjuntos de datos completos a la base de datos local) de manera más eficiente al utilizar mejor los recursos de red distribuidos entre clientes activos de una arquitectura de servidor de clientes.

El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. La Sección 2 describe nuestro enfoque de cliente cliente con más detalle. La Sección 3 se centra en el nombramiento, nuestro enfoque entre pares. La Sección 4 discute nuestro trabajo en relación con el trabajo existente. La Sección 5 describe una muestra de escenario de navegador de Internet de arena para nuestros dos enfoques de acceso remoto. La Sección 6 contiene comentarios finales, así como futuras direcciones de investigación.2. El enfoque del cliente-servidor tradicionalmente, los sistemas de información geográfica (SIG), como Arcinfo de ESRI [2] y muchas bases de datos espaciales, están diseñados para ser productos independientes. La base de datos espacial se mantiene en la misma computadora o red de área local desde donde se visualiza y consulta. Esta arquitectura permite la transferencia instantánea de grandes cantidades de datos entre la base de datos espacial y el módulo de visualización para que sea perfectamente razonable utilizar protocolos de ancho de banda grande para la comunicación entre ellos. Sin embargo, hay muchas aplicaciones en las que es deseable un enfoque más distribuido. En estos casos, la base de datos se mantiene en una ubicación, mientras que los usuarios deben trabajar con ella desde sitios posiblemente distantes a través de la red (por ejemplo, Internet). Estas conexiones pueden ser mucho más lentas y menos confiables que las redes de área local y, por lo tanto, es deseable limitar el flujo de datos entre la base de datos (servidor) y la unidad de visualización (cliente) para obtener una respuesta oportuna del sistema. Nuestro enfoque de cliente cliente (Figura 1) permite que el motor de la base de datos real se ejecute en una ubicación central mantenida por expertos en bases de datos espaciales, mientras que los usuarios finales adquieren un componente cliente basado en Javab que les proporciona una puerta de enlace en el motor de base de datos espacial de arena. Nuestro cliente es más que un simple visor de imágenes. En cambio, opera en datos vectoriales que permiten al cliente ejecutar muchas operaciones, como el zoom o consultas de ubicación localmente. En la Figura 1: navegador de Internet de arena: arquitectura cliente -servidor.Esencia, se ejecuta un motor de base de datos espacial simple en el cliente. Esta base de datos mantiene una copia de un subconjunto de toda la base de datos cuya versión completa se mantiene en el servidor. Este es un concepto similar al almacenamiento en caché. En nuestro caso, el cliente actúa como un servidor liviano en los datos dados, evalúa consultas y proporciona el módulo de visualización con objetos a mostrar. Inicia la comunicación con el servidor solo en los casos en que no tiene suficientes datos almacenados localmente. Dado que la base de datos de ejecución local solo se actualiza cuando se necesitan datos adicionales o más nuevos, nuestra arquitectura permite al sistema minimizar el tráfico de red entre el cliente y el servidor al ejecutar las operaciones más comunes del lado del usuario, como el zoom y la panorama. De hecho, mientras el usuario explore una región a la vez (es decir, él o ella no está panorámica en toda la base de datos), no se deben recuperar datos adicionales después de la población inicial de la base de datos del lado del cliente. Esto hace que el sistema sea mucho más receptivo que los servicios de mapeo web. Debido a la complejidad de evaluar consultas arbitrarias (es decir, consultas más complejas que consultas de ventanas que se necesitan para la visualización de la base de datos), no realizamos consultas especificadas por el usuario en el cliente. Todas las consultas de los usuarios aún se evalúan en el lado del servidor y los resultados se descargan en el cliente para su visualización. Sin embargo, suponiendo que las consultas son lo suficientemente selectivas (es decir, hay muchos menos elementos devueltos de la consulta que el número de elementos en la base de datos), el retraso de respuesta generalmente está dentro de los límites razonables.2.1 Comunicación del cliente-servidor Como se mencionó anteriormente, el navegador de Internet de arena es una pieza de cliente del servidor de base de datos espacial accesible remotamente construido alrededor del kernel de arena. Para comunicarse con el servidor, cuya interfaz de programación de aplicaciones (API) es un lenguaje de secuencias de comandos basado en TCL, se requiere un servlet diseñado específicamente para interactuar el navegador de Internet de arena con el núcleo de arena en el lado del servidor. Este servlet escucha en un puerto determinado del servidor para las solicitudes entrantes del cliente. Traduce estas solicitudes al idioma Sand-TCL. A continuación, transmite estos comandos o scripts Sand-TCL al núcleo de arena. Después de que el núcleo proporcione los resultados, el servlet los obtiene y los procesa, y luego envía esos resultados al cliente de origen. Una vez que se lanza Java Servlet, espera a que un cliente inicie una conexión. Maneja ambas solicitudes para el código Java del cliente real (necesario cuando el cliente se ejecuta como un applet) y el tráfico de arena. Cuando se lanza la pieza del cliente, se conecta al servlet de arena, la comunicación es impulsada por la pieza del cliente;El servidor solo responde a las consultas de los clientes. El cliente inicia una transacción al enviar una consulta. El servlet Java analiza la consulta y crea una expresión o script de arena correspondiente en el formato nativo de los núcleos de arena. Luego se envía al núcleo para su evaluación o ejecución. La respuesta de los núcleos depende naturalmente de la consulta y puede ser un valor booleano, un número o una cadena que representa un valor (por ejemplo, un color predeterminado) o, una tupla completa (por ejemplo, en respuesta a una consulta de tupla más cercana). Si se envió un script al kernel (por ejemplo, solicitando todas las tuplas que coinciden con algunos criterios), entonces el servidor de arena puede devolver una cantidad arbitraria de datos. En este caso, los datos se comprimen primero antes de que se envíen a través de la red al cliente. El flujo de datos se descomprime en el cliente antes de analizar los resultados. Observe que si se usara otra base de datos espacial en lugar del núcleo de arena, entonces solo se debe hacer una simple modificación al servlet para que el navegador de Internet de arena funcione correctamente. En particular, las consultas enviadas por el cliente deberían ser recodificadas en otro idioma de consulta que sea nativo de esta base de datos espacial diferente. El formato del protocolo utilizado para la comunicación entre el servlet y el cliente no se ve afectado.3. El enfoque de igual a igual que muchos usuarios pueden querer trabajar en un conjunto de datos espaciales completos durante un período prolongado de tiempo. En este caso, puede ser necesaria una inversión inicial de descarga de todo el conjunto de datos para garantizar una sesión satisfactoria. Desafortunadamente, los datos espaciales tienden a ser grandes. Algunas solicitudes de descarga a un gran conjunto de datos de un conjunto de clientes inactivos que esperan ser atendidos pueden ralentizar el servidor para que se rastree. Esto se debe al hecho de que el enfoque común de cliente cliente para transferir datos entre los dos extremos de una conexión asume un papel designado para cada uno de los extremos (es decir, algunos clientes y un servidor). Construimos nombrar como un sistema centralizado de igual a igual para demostrar nuestro enfoque para mejorar los sistemas comunes de cliente cliente. Todavía existe un servidor. Existe una fuente central para los datos y un mecanismo de decisión para el servicio. El entorno aún funciona como un entorno de cliente cliente en muchas circunstancias. Sin embargo, a diferencia de muchos entornos comunes de cliente cliente, nombrar mantiene más información sobre los clientes. Esto incluye inventarios de lo que cada cliente descarga, sus disponibilidades, etc. Cuando el servicio cliente-servidor comienza a funcionar mal o una solicitud de un elemento de datos proviene de un cliente con una conexión deficiente con el servidor, el nombramiento puede comenzar a nombrar clientes activos apropiados del sistema para servir en nombre del servidor, es decir, clientes.quienes ya han ofrecido sus servicios y pueden asumir el papel de pares (por lo tanto, pasar de un esquema de cliente cliente a un esquema de igual a igual). El servidor todavía realiza el servicio de directorio para los clientes activos, pero el servidor ya no atiende a todas las solicitudes. En este esquema, los clientes se utilizan principalmente con el fin de compartir sus recursos de red en lugar de introducir contenido nuevo y, por lo tanto, ayudan a otor al servidor y ampliar el servicio. La existencia de un servidor es más simple en términos de administración de pares dinámicos en comparación con los enfoques de peer-peer puro donde una inundación de mensajes para descubrir quién todavía está activo en el sistema debe ser utilizado por cada par que debe tomar una decisión. El servidor también es la principal fuente de datos y, en circunstancias regulares, puede no reenviar el servicio. Se supone que los datos están formados por archivos. Un solo archivo forma el medio atómico de comunicación. Designa las solicitudes con respecto a estas solicitudes atómicas. Los conjuntos de datos de acceso frecuente se replican como un subproducto de haber sido solicitado por una gran cantidad de usuarios. Esto abre el potencial para evitar el servidor en descargas futuras para los datos de otros usuarios, ya que ahora hay muchos puntos nuevos de acceso. Evitar el servidor es útil cuando el ancho de banda de los servidores es limitado. La existencia de un servidor asegura que los datos impopulares también están disponibles en todo momento. El servicio depende de la disponibilidad del servidor. El servidor ahora es más resistente a la congestión ya que el servicio es más escalable. Las copias de seguridad y otras actividades de mantenimiento ya se están realizando en el servidor y, por lo tanto, no se necesita ningún esfuerzo administrativo adicional para los pares dinámicos. Si un par cae, no se toman precauciones adicionales. De hecho, el nombramiento no requiere recursos adicionales de un entorno de cliente cliente ya existente, pero, en cambio, amplía su capacidad. Los compañeros simplemente llegan o salen de una tabla en el servidor. La carga de datos se logra de manera similar a la descarga de datos. Para cargas, los clientes activos se pueden utilizar nuevamente. Los usuarios pueden cargar sus datos en un conjunto de pares que no sean el servidor si el servidor está ocupado o reside en una ubicación distante. Finalmente, los datos se propagan al servidor. Todas las operaciones se realizan de manera transparente para los clientes. Tras la conexión inicial con el servidor, se pueden consultar si quieren o no compartir o no su tiempo de red inactivo y su espacio en disco. El resto de las operaciones siguen transparentemente después del contacto inicial. Designe trabajos en la capa de solicitud pero no en capas inferiores. Esto logra la independencia de la plataforma y la implementación fácil del sistema. El nombramiento no es un reemplazo, sino una adición a las arquitecturas de cliente cliente actuales. Desarrollamos una biblioteca de llamadas de funciones que cuando se colocan en una arquitectura de cliente cliente inicia el servicio. Estamos desarrollando esquemas avanzados de selección de pares que incorporan la ubicación de los clientes activos, el ancho de banda entre los clientes activos, el tamaño de los datos para transferir, cargar en clientes activos y la disponibilidad de clientes activos para formar un medio completo para seleccionar los mejores clientes que pueden convertirse enAlternativas eficientes al servidor. Con el nombramiento, estamos definiendo una API muy simple que podría usarse dentro de un sistema de servidor cliente existente fácilmente. En lugar de la negación del servicio o una conexión lenta, esta API se puede utilizar para reenviar el servicio de manera adecuada. La API para el lado del servidor es: start (serverportno) makefileAvailable (archivo, ubicación, boolean) devolución de llamada recibida (archivo, ubicación) Callback ErrorrreCeivingFile (archivo, ubicación, error) Stop () De manera similar, la API para el lado del cliente es: Start (Start (Start (Start (Start (Start (Start (ClientPortno, ServerPortno, ServerAddress) MakefileAvailable (archivo, ubicación, boolean) RecibeFile (archivo, ubicación) sendFile (archivo, ubicación) stop () el servidor, después de iniciar el servicio de designación, puede hacer que todos los archivos de datos estén disponibles para los clientes medianteUso del método MakeFileAvailable. Esto permitirá que el Nombre para tratar al servidor sea uno de los pares. Los dos métodos de devolución de llamada del servidor se invocan cuando se recibe un archivo de un cliente, o cuando se encuentra un error al recibir un archivo de un cliente. Designar guar7 Figura 2: La operación de localización en el nombramiento.Antees que al menos una de las devoluciones de llamada se llamará para que el usuario (que pueda no estar en línea más) siempre se pueda notificar (es decir, por correo electrónico). Los clientes que localizan archivos de datos grandes pueden poner estos archivos a disposición del público utilizando el método MakefileAvailable en el lado del cliente. Por ejemplo, en nuestro navegador de Internet de arena, tenemos la localización de los datos espaciales en función que se pueden elegir de nuestros menús. Esta funcionalidad permite a los usuarios descargar conjuntos de datos completamente en sus discos locales antes de comenzar sus consultas o análisis. En nuestra implementación, tenemos llamadas al servicio de designación tanto en el cliente como en los lados del servidor como se mencionó anteriormente. Por lo tanto, cuando una solicitud de localización llega al navegador de Internet de arena, el navegador deja las decisiones de encontrar y localizar de manera óptima un conjunto de datos en el servicio de designación. Nuestro servidor también pone a disposición sus archivos de datos sobre el designación. El mecanismo para la operación de localización se muestra con más detalles de los protocolos de designación en la Figura 2. La operación de carga se realiza de manera similar.4. Trabajo relacionado ha habido una cantidad sustancial de investigación sobre el acceso remoto a los datos espaciales. Un enfoque específico ha sido adoptado por numerosos servicios de mapeo basados en la web (Mapquest [5], Mapsonus [6], etc.). El objetivo en este enfoque es habilitar usuarios remotos, generalmente solo equipados con navegadores web estándar, para acceder al servidor de base de datos espacial de la compañía y recuperar información en forma de mapas pictóricos de ellos. La solución presentada por la mayoría de estos proveedores se basa en realizar todos los cálculos en el lado del servidor y transferir solo mapas de bits que representan los resultados de las consultas y comandos de los usuarios. Aunque la ventaja de esta solución es la minimización de los recursos de hardware y software en el sitio del cliente, el producto resultante tiene limitaciones severas en términos de funcionalidad y tiempo de respuesta disponible (cada acción del usuario da como resultado un nuevo mapa de bits que se transfiere al cliente). El trabajo descrito en [9] examina una arquitectura de cliente cliente para ver imágenes grandes que opera a través de una conexión de red de bajo ancho de banda. Presenta una técnica basada en transformaciones wavelet que permite la minimización de la cantidad de datos necesarios para transferirse a través de la red entre el servidor y el cliente. En este caso, mientras el servidor contiene la representación completa de la imagen grande, solo se debe transferir una cantidad limitada de datos al cliente para permitirle mostrar una vista solicitada actualmente en la imagen. En el lado del cliente, la imagen se reconstruye en una representación piramidal para acelerar las operaciones de zoom y panorama. Tanto el cliente como el servidor mantienen una máscara común que indica qué partes de la imagen están disponibles en el cliente y qué debe solicitarse. Esto también permite soltar partes innecesarias de la imagen desde la memoria principal del servidor. Se ha informado otro trabajo relacionado en [16] donde se describe una arquitectura de cliente cliente que está diseñada para proporcionar a los usuarios finales acceso a un servidor. Se supone que este servidor de datos administra grandes bases de datos que no son prácticas para almacenarse en clientes individuales. Este trabajo combina la gestión de datos de trama (almacenada en pirámides [22]) con datos vectoriales almacenados en Quadtrees [19, 20]. Para nuestro enfoque de transferencia de pares (nombramiento), Napster es el antepasado donde un servicio de directorio está centralizado en un servidor y los usuarios intercambian archivos de música que han almacenado en sus discos locales. Nuestro dominio de aplicación, donde los datos ya están disponibles gratuitamente para el público, forma un candidato principal para un enfoque de este punto de vista. Gnutella es un sistema de intercambio de archivos entre pares (descentralizado). Desafortunadamente, sufre problemas de escalabilidad, es decir, se requieren inundaciones de mensajes entre pares para mapear la conectividad en el sistema. Otros sistemas siguieron estos sistemas populares, cada uno abordando un sabor diferente de compartir a través de Internet. Muchos sistemas de almacenamiento entre pares también han surgido recientemente. Pasado [18], el servicio de la eternidad [7], CFS [10] y OceanStore [15] son algunos sistemas de almacenamiento entre pares. Algunos de estos sistemas se han centrado en el anonimato, mientras que otros se han centrado en la persistencia del almacenamiento. Además, otros enfoques, como Seti@Home [21], hicieron otros recursos, como las CPU inactivas, trabajaron juntos a través de Internet para resolver problemas computacionales a gran escala. Nuestro objetivo es diferente a estos enfoques. Con el nombramiento, queremos mejorar los sistemas de servidor cliente existentes en términos de rendimiento mediante el uso de recursos de redes inactivas entre los clientes activos. Por lo tanto, otros temas como el anonimato, la descentralización y la persistencia del almacenamiento fueron menos importantes en nuestras decisiones. La confirmación de la autenticidad de los conjuntos de datos entregados indirectamente aún no se ha abordado con el nombramiento. Queremos expandir nuestra investigación, en el futuro, para abordar este problema. Desde nuestra perspectiva, aunque el nombramiento emplea algunas de las técnicas utilizadas en los sistemas entre pares, también está estrechamente relacionado con las arquitecturas de almacenamiento web actuales. La ardilla [13] forma el suelo medio. Crea un caché web colaborativo de pares de pares puro entre los cachés del navegador web de las máquinas en una red de área local. Excepto por este reciente enfoque de pares, el almacenamiento en caché web es principalmente un tema bien estudio en el ámbito del almacenamiento en caché del nivel de servidor/proxy [8, 11, 14, 17]. Los sistemas de almacenamiento en almacenamiento web colaborativo, el más relevante de estos para nuestra investigación, se centran en crear esquemas jerárquicos, basados en el hash, basados en directorio central o basados en el almacenamiento de almacenamiento de multicasts. No compitimos con estos enfoques. De hecho, el nombramiento puede trabajar en conjunto con almacenamiento en caché web colaborativo si se implementan juntos. Intentamos abordar la situación en la que llega una solicitud a un servidor, lo que significa que todos los cachés informan que faltan. Por lo tanto, el punto en el que se alcanza el servidor puede usarse para tomar una decisión central, pero luego la solicitud de servicio real se puede reenviar a un conjunto de clientes activos, es decir, las operaciones de carga y carga Down8. Las fallas de caché son especialmente comunes en el tipo de grandes servicios basados en datos en los que estamos trabajando. La mayoría de los esquemas de almacenamiento en caché web que se usan hoy en día emplean una política de reemplazo que da prioridad a reemplazar los artículos de mayor tamaño sobre los de menor tamaño. Por lo tanto, estas políticas conducirían al reemplazo inmediato de nuestros archivos de datos relativamente grandes a pesar de que pueden usarse con frecuencia. Además, en nuestro caso, la comunidad de usuarios que accede a un determinado archivo de datos también puede estar muy disperso desde el punto de vista de la red y, por lo tanto, no puede aprovechar ninguno de los esquemas de almacenamiento en caché. Finalmente, ninguno de los métodos de almacenamiento en caché web abordan el problema simétrico de las grandes cargas de datos.5. Una aplicación de muestra Fedstats [1] es una fuente en línea que permite a los ciudadanos comunes el acceso a estadísticas oficiales de numerosas agencias federales sin saber de antemano qué agencia las produjo. Estamos utilizando un conjunto de datos FedStats como un Bed de prueba para nuestro trabajo. Nuestro objetivo es proporcionar más potencia a los usuarios de Fedstats utilizando el navegador de Internet Sand. Como ejemplo, observamos dos archivos de datos correspondientes a instalaciones reguladas por la Agencia de Protección Ambiental (EPA) que tienen cloro y arsénico, respectivamente. Para cada archivo, teníamos la siguiente información disponible: EPA-ID, nombre, calle, ciudad, estado, código postal, latitud, longitud, seguido de banderas para indicar si esa instalación está en los siguientes programas de la EPA: desechos peligrosos, descarga de aguas residuales, Emisiones de aire, volcado de desechos tóxicos abandonados y liberación tóxica activa. Ponemos estos datos en una relación de arena donde la ubicación del atributo espacial corresponde a la latitud y la longitud. Algunas consultas que se pueden manejar con nuestro sistema en estos datos incluyen: 1. Encuentre todas las instalaciones reguladas por la EPA que tienen arsénico y participen en el programa de emisiones de aire, y: (a) se encuentran en Georgia a Illinois, alfabéticamente.(b) Acuéstese dentro de Arkansas o 30 millas dentro de su frontera.(c) Se encuentre dentro de las 30 millas de la frontera de Arkansas (es decir, ambos lados de la frontera).2. Para cada instalación regulada por EPA que tiene arsénico, encuentre todas las instalaciones reguladas por la EPA que tienen cloro y: (a) que están más cerca de él que de cualquier otra instalación eparegada que tenga arsénico.(b) que participan en el programa de emisiones de aire y están más cerca de él que de cualquier otra instalación eparegada que tenga arsénico. Para evitar informar una instalación en particular más de una vez, usamos nuestro grupo mediante el mecanismo EPA-ID. La Figura 3 ilustra la salida de una consulta de ejemplo que encuentra todos los sitios de arsénico a una distancia dada del borde de Arkansas. Los sitios se obtienen de manera incremental con respecto a un punto dado. Este pedido se muestra usando diferentes tonos de color. Con estos datos de ejemplo, es posible trabajar con el navegador de Internet Sand en línea como un applet (conectarse a un servidor remoto) o después de localizar los datos y luego abrirlo localmente. En el primer caso, para cada acción tomada, la arquitectura cliente-servidor decidirá qué solicitar al servidor. En el último caso, el navegador utilizará la arquitectura de designación de pares de pares para localizar primero los datos.6. Observaciones finales Se ha dado una descripción general de nuestros esfuerzos para proporcionar acceso remoto a datos espaciales grandes. Hemos esbozado nuestros enfoques e introdujimos sus elementos individuales. Nuestro enfoque de cliente cliente mejora el rendimiento del sistema mediante el uso de métodos de almacenamiento en caché eficientes cuando se accede a un servidor remoto desde clientes delgados. Nombera un enfoque alternativo que mejora el rendimiento bajo un sistema de servidor de clientes existentes mediante el uso de recursos de cliente inactivo cuando los usuarios individuales desean trabajar en un conjunto de datos por períodos más largos de tiempo utilizando las computadoras de sus clientes. Para el futuro, imaginamos el desarrollo de nuevos algoritmos eficientes que admitirán grandes transferencias de datos en línea dentro de nuestro enfoque entre pares utilizando múltiples pares simultáneamente. Suponemos que un par (cliente) puede no estar disponible en cualquier momento y, por lo tanto, las disposiciones deben estar en su lugar para manejar dicha situación. Para abordar esto, aumentaremos nuestros métodos para incluir actualizaciones dinámicas eficientes. Al finalizar este paso de nuestro trabajo, también planeamos ejecutar estudios integrales de rendimiento sobre nuestros métodos. Otro problema es cómo acceder a los datos de diferentes fuentes en diferentes formatos. Para acceder a múltiples fuentes de datos en tiempo real, es deseable buscar un mecanismo que admita el intercambio de datos por diseño. El protocolo XML [3] ha surgido para convertirse prácticamente en un estándar para describir y comunicar datos arbitrarios. GML [4] es una variante XML que se está volviendo cada vez más popular para el intercambio de datos geográficos. Actualmente estamos trabajando para hacer que Sand XML sea compatible para que el usuario pueda recuperar instantáneamente los datos espaciales proporcionados por varias agencias en el formato GML a través de sus servicios web y luego explorar, consultar o procesar estos datos más dentro del marco de arena. Esto convertirá el sistema de arena en una herramienta universal para acceder a cualquier conjunto de datos espaciales, ya que se implementará en la mayoría de las plataformas, funcionará de manera eficiente dadas grandes cantidades de datos, poder tocar cualquier fuente de datos habilitada para GML y proporcionar un uso fácil de usarinterfaz gráfica del usuario. Esto también convertirá el sistema de arena de un prototipo orientado a la investigación en un producto que los usuarios finales podrían utilizar para acceder, ver y analizar sus datos de manera eficiente y con un esfuerzo mínimo.7.

        "This way, users across various platforms can continuously access large spatial data on a remote location with little or 15 no need for any preceding software installation.",
        "The second option is to use a stand-alone SAND Internet Browser along with a locally-installed Internet-enabled database management system (server piece).",
        "In this case, the SAND Internet Browser can still be utilized to view data from remote locations.",
        "However, frequently accessed data can be downloaded to the local database on demand, and subsequently accessed locally.",
        "Power users can also upload large volumes of spatial data back to the remote server using this enhanced client.",
        "We focused our efforts in two directions.",
        "We first aimed at developing a client-server architecture with efficient caching methods to balance local resources on one side and the significant latency of the network connection on the other.",
        "The low bandwidth of this connection is the primary concern in both cases.",
        "The outcome of this research primarily addresses the issues of our first type of usage (i.e., as a remote browser application or an applet) for our browser and other similar applications.",
        "The second direction aims at helping users that wish to manipulate large volumes of online data for prolonged periods.",
        "We have developed a centralized peerto-peer approach to provide the users with the ability to transfer large volumes of data (i.e., whole data sets to the local database) more efficiently by better utilizing the distributed network resources among active clients of a clientserver architecture.",
        "We call this architecture APPOINTApproach for Peer-to-Peer Oﬄoading the INTernet.",
        "The results of this research addresses primarily the issues of the second type of usage for our SAND Internet Browser (i.e., as a stand-alone application).",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes our client-server approach in more detail.",
        "Section 3 focuses on APPOINT, our peer-to-peer approach.",
        "Section 4 discusses our work in relation to existing work.",
        "Section 5 outlines a sample SAND Internet Browser scenario for both of our remote access approaches.",
        "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
        "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
        "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
        "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
        "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
        "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
        "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
        "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
        "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
        "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
        "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
        "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
        "This is a concept similar to caching.",
        "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
        "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
        "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
        "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
        "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
        "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
        "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
        "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
        "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
        "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
        "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
        "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
        "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
        "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
        "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
        "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
        "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
        "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
        "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
        "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
        "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
        "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
        "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
        "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
        "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
        "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
        "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
        "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
        "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
        "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
        "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
        "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
        "A server still exists.",
        "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
        "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
        "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
        "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
        "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
        "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
        "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
        "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
        "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
        "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
        "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
        "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
        "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
        "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
        "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
        "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
        "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
        "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
        "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
        "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
        "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
        "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
        "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
        "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
        "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",
        "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
        "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",
        "Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space.",
        "The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact.",
        "APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers.",
        "This achieves platform independence and easy deployment of the system.",
        "APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures.",
        "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service.",
        "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
        "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
        "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
        "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",
        "This will enable APPOINT to treat the server as one of the peers.",
        "The two callback methods of the server are invoked when a file is received from a client, or when an error is encountered while receiving a file from a client.",
        "APPOINT guar7 Figure 2: The localization operation in APPOINT. antees that at least one of the callbacks will be called so that the user (who may not be online anymore) can always be notified (i.e., via email).",
        "Clients localizing large data files can make these files available to the public by using the makeFileAvailable method on the client side.",
        "For example, in our SAND Internet Browser, we have the localization of spatial data as a function that can be chosen from our menus.",
        "This functionality enables users to download data sets completely to their local disks before starting their queries or analysis.",
        "In our implementation, we have calls to the APPOINT service both on the client and the server sides as mentioned above.",
        "Hence, when a localization request comes to the SAND Internet Browser, the browser leaves the decisions to optimally find and localize a data set to the APPOINT service.",
        "Our server also makes its data files available over APPOINT.",
        "The mechanism for the localization operation is shown with more details from the APPOINT protocols in Figure 2.",
        "The upload operation is performed in a similar fashion. 4.",
        "RELATED WORK There has been a substantial amount of research on remote access to spatial data.",
        "One specific approach has been adopted by numerous Web-based mapping services (MapQuest [5], MapsOnUs [6], etc.).",
        "The goal in this approach is to enable remote users, typically only equipped with standard Web browsers, to access the companys spatial database server and retrieve information in the form of pictorial maps from them.",
        "The solution presented by most of these vendors is based on performing all the calculations on the server side and transferring only bitmaps that represent results of user queries and commands.",
        "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",
        "Work described in [9] examines a client-server architecture for viewing large images that operates over a lowbandwidth network connection.",
        "It presents a technique based on wavelet transformations that allows the minimization of the amount of data needed to be transferred over the network between the server and the client.",
        "In this case, while the server holds the full representation of the large image, only a limited amount of data needs to be transferred to the client to enable it to display a currently requested view into the image.",
        "On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations.",
        "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",
        "This also allows dropping unnecessary parts of the image from the main memory on the server.",
        "Other related work has been reported in [16] where a client-server architecture is described that is designed to provide end users with access to a server.",
        "It is assumed that this data server manages vast databases that are impractical to be stored on individual clients.",
        "This work blends raster data management (stored in pyramids [22]) with vector data stored in quadtrees [19, 20].",
        "For our peer-to-peer transfer approach (APPOINT), Napster is the forefather where a directory service is centralized on a server and users exchange music files that they have stored on their local disks.",
        "Our application domain, where the data is already freely available to the public, forms a prime candidate for such a peer-to-peer approach.",
        "Gnutella is a pure (decentralized) peer-to-peer file exchange system.",
        "Unfortunately, it suffers from scalability issues, i.e., floods of messages between peers in order to map connectivity in the system are required.",
        "Other systems followed these popular systems, each addressing a different flavor of sharing over the Internet.",
        "Many peer-to-peer storage systems have also recently emerged.",
        "PAST [18], Eternity Service [7], CFS [10], and OceanStore [15] are some peer-to-peer storage systems.",
        "Some of these systems have focused on anonymity while others have focused on persistence of storage.",
        "Also, other approaches, like SETI@Home [21], made other resources, such as idle CPUs, work together over the Internet to solve large scale computational problems.",
        "Our goal is different than these approaches.",
        "With APPOINT, we want to improve existing client-server systems in terms of performance by using idle networking resources among active clients.",
        "Hence, other issues like anonymity, decentralization, and persistence of storage were less important in our decisions.",
        "Confirming the authenticity of the indirectly delivered data sets is not yet addressed with APPOINT.",
        "We want to expand our research, in the future, to address this issue.",
        "From our perspective, although APPOINT employs some of the techniques used in peer-to-peer systems, it is also closely related to current Web caching architectures.",
        "Squirrel [13] forms the middle ground.",
        "It creates a pure peer-topeer collaborative Web cache among the Web browser caches of the machines in a local-area network.",
        "Except for this recent peer-to-peer approach, Web caching is mostly a wellstudied topic in the realm of server/proxy level caching [8, 11, 14, 17].",
        "Collaborative Web caching systems, the most relevant of these for our research, focus on creating either a hierarchical, hash-based, central directory-based, or multicast-based caching schemes.",
        "We do not compete with these approaches.",
        "In fact, APPOINT can work in tandem with collaborative Web caching if they are deployed together.",
        "We try to address the situation where a request arrives at a server, meaning all the caches report a miss.",
        "Hence, the point where the server is reached can be used to take a central decision but then the actual service request can be forwarded to a set of active clients, i.e., the down8 load and upload operations.",
        "Cache misses are especially common in the type of large data-based services on which we are working.",
        "Most of the Web caching schemes that are in use today employ a replacement policy that gives a priority to replacing the largest sized items over smaller-sized ones.",
        "Hence, these policies would lead to the immediate replacement of our relatively large data files even though they may be used frequently.",
        "In addition, in our case, the user community that accesses a certain data file may also be very dispersed from a network point of view and thus cannot take advantage of any of the caching schemes.",
        "Finally, none of the Web caching methods address the symmetric issue of large data uploads. 5.",
        "A SAMPLE APPLICATION FedStats [1] is an online source that enables ordinary citizens access to official statistics of numerous federal agencies without knowing in advance which agency produced them.",
        "We are using a FedStats data set as a testbed for our work.",
        "Our goal is to provide more power to the users of FedStats by utilizing the SAND Internet Browser.",
        "As an example, we looked at two data files corresponding to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-regulated facilities that have chlorine and arsenic, respectively.",
        "For each file, we had the following information available: EPA-ID, name, street, city, state, zip code, latitude, longitude, followed by flags to indicate if that facility is in the following EPA programs: Hazardous Waste, Wastewater Discharge, Air Emissions, Abandoned Toxic Waste Dump, and Active Toxic Release.",
        "We put this data into a SAND relation where the spatial attribute location corresponds to the latitude and longitude.",
        "Some queries that can be handled with our system on this data include: 1.",
        "Find all EPA-regulated facilities that have arsenic and participate in the Air Emissions program, and: (a) Lie in Georgia to Illinois, alphabetically. (b) Lie within Arkansas or 30 miles within its border. (c) Lie within 30 miles of the border of Arkansas (i.e., both sides of the border). 2.",
        "For each EPA-regulated facility that has arsenic, find all EPA-regulated facilities that have chlorine and: (a) That are closer to it than to any other EPAregulated facility that has arsenic. (b) That participate in the Air Emissions program and are closer to it than to any other EPAregulated facility which has arsenic.",
        "In order to avoid reporting a particular facility more than once, we use our group by EPA-ID mechanism.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates the output of an example query that finds all arsenic sites within a given distance of the border of Arkansas.",
        "The sites are obtained in an incremental manner with respect to a given point.",
        "This ordering is shown by using different color shades.",
        "With this example data, it is possible to work with the SAND Internet Browser online as an applet (connecting to a remote server) or after localizing the data and then opening it locally.",
        "In the first case, for each action taken, the client-server architecture will decide what to ask for from the server.",
        "In the latter case, the browser will use the peerto-peer APPOINT architecture for first localizing the data. 6.",
        "CONCLUDING REMARKS An overview of our efforts in providing remote access to large spatial data has been given.",
        "We have outlined our approaches and introduced their individual elements.",
        "Our client-server approach improves the system performance by using efficient caching methods when a remote server is accessed from thin-clients.",
        "APPOINT forms an alternative approach that improves performance under an existing clientserver system by using idle client resources when individual users want work on a data set for longer periods of time using their client computers.",
        "For the future, we envision development of new efficient algorithms that will support large online data transfers within our peer-to-peer approach using multiple peers simultaneously.",
        "We assume that a peer (client) can become unavailable at any anytime and hence provisions need to be in place to handle such a situation.",
        "To address this, we will augment our methods to include efficient dynamic updates.",
        "Upon completion of this step of our work, we also plan to run comprehensive performance studies on our methods.",
        "Another issue is how to access data from different sources in different formats.",
        "In order to access multiple data sources in real time, it is desirable to look for a mechanism that would support data exchange by design.",
        "The XML protocol [3] has emerged to become virtually a standard for describing and communicating arbitrary data.",
        "GML [4] is an XML variant that is becoming increasingly popular for exchange of geographical data.",
        "We are currently working on making SAND XML-compatible so that the user can instantly retrieve spatial data provided by various agencies in the GML format via their Web services and then explore, query, or process this data further within the SAND framework.",
        "This will turn the SAND system into a universal tool for accessing any spatial data set as it will be deployable on most platforms, work efficiently given large amounts of data, be able to tap any GML-enabled data source, and provide an easy to use graphical user interface.",
        "This will also convert the SAND system from a research-oriented prototype into a product that could be used by end users for accessing, viewing, and analyzing their data efficiently and with minimum effort. 7.",

                "Unfortunately, interactive <br>remote access</br> to spatial data slows to a crawl without proper data access mechanisms.",
                "We developed two separate methods for improving the system performance, together, form a dynamic network infrastructure that is highly scalable and provides a satisfactory user experience for interactions with large volumes of online spatial data.",
                "The core functionality responsible for the actual database operations is performed by the server-based SAND system.",
                "SAND is a spatial database system developed at the University of Maryland [12].",

                "Users specify queries by choosing the desired selection conditions from a variety of menus and dialog boxes.",
                "SAND Internet Browser is Java-based, which makes it deployable across many platforms.",
                "In addition, since Java has often been installed on target computers beforehand, our clients can be deployed on these systems with little or no need for any additional software installation or customization.",
                "The system can start being utilized immediately without any prior setup which can be extremely beneficial in time-sensitive usage scenarios such as emergencies.",
                "There are two ways to deploy SAND.",
                "First, any standard Web browser can be used to retrieve and run the client piece (SAND Internet Browser) as a Java application or an applet.",
                "This way, users across various platforms can continuously access large spatial data on a remote location with little or 15 no need for any preceding software installation.",
                "The second option is to use a stand-alone SAND Internet Browser along with a locally-installed Internet-enabled database management system (server piece).",
                "In this case, the SAND Internet Browser can still be utilized to view data from remote locations.",
                "However, frequently accessed data can be downloaded to the local database on demand, and subsequently accessed locally.",
                "Power users can also upload large volumes of spatial data back to the remote server using this enhanced client.",
                "We focused our efforts in two directions.",
                "We first aimed at developing a client-server architecture with efficient caching methods to balance local resources on one side and the significant latency of the network connection on the other.",
                "The low bandwidth of this connection is the primary concern in both cases.",
                "The outcome of this research primarily addresses the issues of our first type of usage (i.e., as a remote browser application or an applet) for our browser and other similar applications.",
                "The second direction aims at helping users that wish to manipulate large volumes of online data for prolonged periods.",
                "We have developed a centralized peerto-peer approach to provide the users with the ability to transfer large volumes of data (i.e., whole data sets to the local database) more efficiently by better utilizing the distributed network resources among active clients of a clientserver architecture.",
                "We call this architecture APPOINTApproach for Peer-to-Peer Oﬄoading the INTernet.",
                "The results of this research addresses primarily the issues of the second type of usage for our SAND Internet Browser (i.e., as a stand-alone application).",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 describes our client-server approach in more detail.",
                "Section 3 focuses on APPOINT, our peer-to-peer approach.",

                "Section 5 outlines a sample SAND Internet Browser scenario for both of our <br>remote access</br> approaches.",
                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
                "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
                "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
                "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
                "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
                "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
                "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
                "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",
                "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
                "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",
                "Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space.",
                "The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact.",
                "APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers.",
                "This achieves platform independence and easy deployment of the system.",
                "APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures.",
                "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service.",
                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
                "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",
                "This will enable APPOINT to treat the server as one of the peers.",
                "The two callback methods of the server are invoked when a file is received from a client, or when an error is encountered while receiving a file from a client.",
                "APPOINT guar7 Figure 2: The localization operation in APPOINT. antees that at least one of the callbacks will be called so that the user (who may not be online anymore) can always be notified (i.e., via email).",
                "Clients localizing large data files can make these files available to the public by using the makeFileAvailable method on the client side.",
                "For example, in our SAND Internet Browser, we have the localization of spatial data as a function that can be chosen from our menus.",
                "This functionality enables users to download data sets completely to their local disks before starting their queries or analysis.",
                "In our implementation, we have calls to the APPOINT service both on the client and the server sides as mentioned above.",
                "Hence, when a localization request comes to the SAND Internet Browser, the browser leaves the decisions to optimally find and localize a data set to the APPOINT service.",
                "Our server also makes its data files available over APPOINT.",
                "The mechanism for the localization operation is shown with more details from the APPOINT protocols in Figure 2.",
                "The upload operation is performed in a similar fashion. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK There has been a substantial amount of research on <br>remote access</br> to spatial data.",
                "One specific approach has been adopted by numerous Web-based mapping services (MapQuest [5], MapsOnUs [6], etc.).",
                "The goal in this approach is to enable remote users, typically only equipped with standard Web browsers, to access the companys spatial database server and retrieve information in the form of pictorial maps from them.",
                "The solution presented by most of these vendors is based on performing all the calculations on the server side and transferring only bitmaps that represent results of user queries and commands.",
                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",
                "Work described in [9] examines a client-server architecture for viewing large images that operates over a lowbandwidth network connection.",
                "It presents a technique based on wavelet transformations that allows the minimization of the amount of data needed to be transferred over the network between the server and the client.",
                "In this case, while the server holds the full representation of the large image, only a limited amount of data needs to be transferred to the client to enable it to display a currently requested view into the image.",
                "On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations.",
                "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",
                "This also allows dropping unnecessary parts of the image from the main memory on the server.",
                "Other related work has been reported in [16] where a client-server architecture is described that is designed to provide end users with access to a server.",
                "It is assumed that this data server manages vast databases that are impractical to be stored on individual clients.",
                "This work blends raster data management (stored in pyramids [22]) with vector data stored in quadtrees [19, 20].",
                "For our peer-to-peer transfer approach (APPOINT), Napster is the forefather where a directory service is centralized on a server and users exchange music files that they have stored on their local disks.",
                "Our application domain, where the data is already freely available to the public, forms a prime candidate for such a peer-to-peer approach.",
                "Gnutella is a pure (decentralized) peer-to-peer file exchange system.",
                "Unfortunately, it suffers from scalability issues, i.e., floods of messages between peers in order to map connectivity in the system are required.",
                "Other systems followed these popular systems, each addressing a different flavor of sharing over the Internet.",
                "Many peer-to-peer storage systems have also recently emerged.",
                "PAST [18], Eternity Service [7], CFS [10], and OceanStore [15] are some peer-to-peer storage systems.",
                "Some of these systems have focused on anonymity while others have focused on persistence of storage.",
                "Also, other approaches, like SETI@Home [21], made other resources, such as idle CPUs, work together over the Internet to solve large scale computational problems.",
                "Our goal is different than these approaches.",
                "With APPOINT, we want to improve existing client-server systems in terms of performance by using idle networking resources among active clients.",
                "Hence, other issues like anonymity, decentralization, and persistence of storage were less important in our decisions.",
                "Confirming the authenticity of the indirectly delivered data sets is not yet addressed with APPOINT.",
                "We want to expand our research, in the future, to address this issue.",
                "From our perspective, although APPOINT employs some of the techniques used in peer-to-peer systems, it is also closely related to current Web caching architectures.",
                "Squirrel [13] forms the middle ground.",
                "It creates a pure peer-topeer collaborative Web cache among the Web browser caches of the machines in a local-area network.",
                "Except for this recent peer-to-peer approach, Web caching is mostly a wellstudied topic in the realm of server/proxy level caching [8, 11, 14, 17].",
                "Collaborative Web caching systems, the most relevant of these for our research, focus on creating either a hierarchical, hash-based, central directory-based, or multicast-based caching schemes.",
                "We do not compete with these approaches.",
                "In fact, APPOINT can work in tandem with collaborative Web caching if they are deployed together.",
                "We try to address the situation where a request arrives at a server, meaning all the caches report a miss.",
                "Hence, the point where the server is reached can be used to take a central decision but then the actual service request can be forwarded to a set of active clients, i.e., the down8 load and upload operations.",
                "Cache misses are especially common in the type of large data-based services on which we are working.",
                "Most of the Web caching schemes that are in use today employ a replacement policy that gives a priority to replacing the largest sized items over smaller-sized ones.",

                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",

                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",

                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",

                "APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures.",
                "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service.",
                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
                "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",
                "This will enable APPOINT to treat the server as one of the peers.",
                "The two callback methods of the server are invoked when a file is received from a client, or when an error is encountered while receiving a file from a client.",
                "APPOINT guar7 Figure 2: The localization operation in APPOINT. antees that at least one of the callbacks will be called so that the user (who may not be online anymore) can always be notified (i.e., via email).",

                "The goal in this approach is to enable remote users, typically only equipped with standard Web browsers, to access the companys spatial database server and retrieve information in the form of pictorial maps from them.",
                "The solution presented by most of these vendors is based on performing all the calculations on the server side and transferring only bitmaps that represent results of user queries and commands.",
                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",
                "Work described in [9] examines a client-server architecture for viewing large images that operates over a lowbandwidth network connection.",
                "It presents a technique based on wavelet transformations that allows the minimization of the amount of data needed to be transferred over the network between the server and the client.",
                "In this case, while the server holds the full representation of the large image, only a limited amount of data needs to be transferred to the client to enable it to display a currently requested view into the image.",
                "On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations.",
                "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",
                "This also allows dropping unnecessary parts of the image from the main memory on the server.",
                "Other related work has been reported in [16] where a client-server architecture is described that is designed to provide end users with access to a server.",

                "Interactive work with such large volumes of online spatial data is a challenging task.",
                "We have been developing an interactive browser for accessing spatial online databases: the SAND (Spatial and Non-spatial Data) Internet Browser.",
                "Users of this browser can interactively and visually manipulate spatial data remotely.",
                "Unfortunately, interactive remote access to spatial data slows to a crawl without proper data access mechanisms.",
                "We developed two separate methods for improving the system performance, together, form a dynamic network infrastructure that is highly scalable and provides a satisfactory user experience for interactions with large volumes of online spatial data.",
                "The core functionality responsible for the actual database operations is performed by the server-based SAND system.",
                "SAND is a spatial database system developed at the University of Maryland [12].",
                "The client-side SAND Internet Browser provides a graphical user interface to the facilities of SAND over the Internet.",
                "Users specify queries by choosing the desired selection conditions from a variety of menus and dialog boxes.",
                "SAND Internet Browser is Java-based, which makes it deployable across many platforms.",
                "In addition, since Java has often been installed on target computers beforehand, our clients can be deployed on these systems with little or no need for any additional software installation or customization.",
                "The system can start being utilized immediately without any prior setup which can be extremely beneficial in time-sensitive usage scenarios such as emergencies.",
                "There are two ways to deploy SAND.",
                "First, any standard Web browser can be used to retrieve and run the client piece (SAND Internet Browser) as a Java application or an applet.",
                "This way, users across various platforms can continuously access large spatial data on a remote location with little or 15 no need for any preceding software installation.",
                "The second option is to use a stand-alone SAND Internet Browser along with a locally-installed Internet-enabled database management system (server piece).",
                "In this case, the SAND Internet Browser can still be utilized to view data from remote locations.",
                "However, frequently accessed data can be downloaded to the local database on demand, and subsequently accessed locally.",
                "Power users can also upload large volumes of spatial data back to the remote server using this enhanced client.",
                "We focused our efforts in two directions.",
                "We first aimed at developing a <br>client-server architecture</br> with efficient caching methods to balance local resources on one side and the significant latency of the network connection on the other.",
                "The low bandwidth of this connection is the primary concern in both cases.",
                "The outcome of this research primarily addresses the issues of our first type of usage (i.e., as a remote browser application or an applet) for our browser and other similar applications.",
                "The second direction aims at helping users that wish to manipulate large volumes of online data for prolonged periods.",
                "We have developed a centralized peerto-peer approach to provide the users with the ability to transfer large volumes of data (i.e., whole data sets to the local database) more efficiently by better utilizing the distributed network resources among active clients of a clientserver architecture.",
                "We call this architecture APPOINTApproach for Peer-to-Peer Oﬄoading the INTernet.",
                "The results of this research addresses primarily the issues of the second type of usage for our SAND Internet Browser (i.e., as a stand-alone application).",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 describes our client-server approach in more detail.",
                "Section 3 focuses on APPOINT, our peer-to-peer approach.",

                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - <br>client-server architecture</br>. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
                "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
                "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
                "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
                "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
                "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
                "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
                "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",
                "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
                "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",
                "Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space.",
                "The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact.",
                "APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers.",
                "This achieves platform independence and easy deployment of the system.",
                "APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures.",
                "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a <br>client-server architecture</br> starts the service.",
                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
                "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",
                "This will enable APPOINT to treat the server as one of the peers.",
                "The two callback methods of the server are invoked when a file is received from a client, or when an error is encountered while receiving a file from a client.",
                "APPOINT guar7 Figure 2: The localization operation in APPOINT. antees that at least one of the callbacks will be called so that the user (who may not be online anymore) can always be notified (i.e., via email).",
                "Clients localizing large data files can make these files available to the public by using the makeFileAvailable method on the client side.",
                "For example, in our SAND Internet Browser, we have the localization of spatial data as a function that can be chosen from our menus.",
                "This functionality enables users to download data sets completely to their local disks before starting their queries or analysis.",
                "In our implementation, we have calls to the APPOINT service both on the client and the server sides as mentioned above.",
                "Hence, when a localization request comes to the SAND Internet Browser, the browser leaves the decisions to optimally find and localize a data set to the APPOINT service.",
                "Our server also makes its data files available over APPOINT.",
                "The mechanism for the localization operation is shown with more details from the APPOINT protocols in Figure 2.",
                "The upload operation is performed in a similar fashion. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK There has been a substantial amount of research on remote access to spatial data.",
                "One specific approach has been adopted by numerous Web-based mapping services (MapQuest [5], MapsOnUs [6], etc.).",
                "The goal in this approach is to enable remote users, typically only equipped with standard Web browsers, to access the companys spatial database server and retrieve information in the form of pictorial maps from them.",
                "The solution presented by most of these vendors is based on performing all the calculations on the server side and transferring only bitmaps that represent results of user queries and commands.",
                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",
                "Work described in [9] examines a <br>client-server architecture</br> for viewing large images that operates over a lowbandwidth network connection.",

                "In this case, while the server holds the full representation of the large image, only a limited amount of data needs to be transferred to the client to enable it to display a currently requested view into the image.",
                "On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations.",
                "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",
                "This also allows dropping unnecessary parts of the image from the main memory on the server.",
                "Other related work has been reported in [16] where a <br>client-server architecture</br> is described that is designed to provide end users with access to a server.",

                "Our client-server approach improves the system performance by using efficient caching methods when a remote server is accessed from thin-clients.",
                "APPOINT forms an alternative approach that improves performance under an existing clientserver system by using idle client resources when individual users want work on a data set for longer periods of time using their client computers.",
                "For the future, we envision development of new efficient algorithms that will support large online data transfers within our peer-to-peer approach using multiple peers simultaneously.",
                "We assume that a peer (client) can become unavailable at any anytime and hence provisions need to be in place to handle such a situation.",
                "To address this, we will augment our methods to include efficient dynamic updates.",
                "Upon completion of this step of our work, we also plan to run comprehensive performance studies on our methods.",
                "Another issue is how to access data from different sources in different formats.",

                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",

                "First, any standard Web browser can be used to retrieve and run the client piece (SAND Internet Browser) as a Java application or an applet.",
                "This way, users across various platforms can continuously access large spatial data on a remote location with little or 15 no need for any preceding software installation.",
                "The second option is to use a stand-alone SAND Internet Browser along with a locally-installed Internet-enabled database management system (server piece).",
                "In this case, the SAND Internet Browser can still be utilized to view data from remote locations.",
                "However, frequently accessed data can be downloaded to the local database on demand, and subsequently accessed locally.",
                "Power users can also upload large volumes of spatial data back to the remote server using this enhanced client.",
                "We focused our efforts in two directions.",
                "We first aimed at developing a client-server architecture with efficient caching methods to balance local resources on one side and the significant latency of the network connection on the other.",
                "The low bandwidth of this connection is the primary concern in both cases.",
                "The outcome of this research primarily addresses the issues of our first type of usage (i.e., as a remote browser application or an applet) for our browser and other similar applications.",
                "The second direction aims at helping users that wish to manipulate large volumes of online data for prolonged periods.",
                "We have developed a centralized peerto-peer approach to provide the users with the ability to transfer large volumes of data (i.e., whole data sets to the local database) more efficiently by better utilizing the distributed network resources among active clients of a clientserver architecture.",
                "We call this architecture APPOINTApproach for Peer-to-Peer Oﬄoading the INTernet.",
                "The results of this research addresses primarily the issues of the second type of usage for our SAND Internet Browser (i.e., as a stand-alone application).",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 describes our client-server approach in more detail.",
                "Section 3 focuses on APPOINT, our peer-to-peer approach.",
                "Section 4 discusses our work in relation to existing work.",
                "Section 5 outlines a sample SAND Internet Browser scenario for both of our remote access approaches.",
                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
                "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
                "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
                "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
                "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
                "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
                "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
                "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",
                "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
                "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",
                "Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space.",
                "The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact.",
                "APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers.",
                "This achieves platform independence and easy deployment of the system.",
                "APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures.",
                "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service.",
                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
                "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",
                "This will enable APPOINT to treat the server as one of the peers.",
                "The two callback methods of the server are invoked when a file is received from a client, or when an error is encountered while receiving a file from a client.",
                "APPOINT guar7 Figure 2: The localization operation in APPOINT. antees that at least one of the callbacks will be called so that the user (who may not be online anymore) can always be notified (i.e., via email).",
                "Clients localizing large data files can make these files available to the public by using the makeFileAvailable method on the client side.",
                "For example, in our SAND Internet Browser, we have the localization of spatial data as a function that can be chosen from our menus.",
                "This functionality enables users to download data sets completely to their local disks before starting their queries or analysis.",
                "In our implementation, we have calls to the APPOINT service both on the client and the server sides as mentioned above.",
                "Hence, when a localization request comes to the SAND Internet Browser, the browser leaves the decisions to optimally find and localize a data set to the APPOINT service.",
                "Our server also makes its data files available over APPOINT.",
                "The mechanism for the localization operation is shown with more details from the APPOINT protocols in Figure 2.",
                "The upload operation is performed in a similar fashion. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK There has been a substantial amount of research on remote access to spatial data.",
                "One specific approach has been adopted by numerous Web-based mapping services (MapQuest [5], MapsOnUs [6], etc.).",
                "The goal in this approach is to enable remote users, typically only equipped with standard Web browsers, to access the companys spatial database server and retrieve information in the form of pictorial maps from them.",
                "The solution presented by most of these vendors is based on performing all the calculations on the server side and transferring only bitmaps that represent results of user queries and commands.",
                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",

                "In this case, while the server holds the full representation of the large image, only a limited amount of data needs to be transferred to the client to enable it to display a currently requested view into the image.",
                "On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations.",
                "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",

                "The system can start being utilized immediately without any prior setup which can be extremely beneficial in time-sensitive usage scenarios such as emergencies.",
                "There are two ways to deploy SAND.",
                "First, any standard Web browser can be used to retrieve and run the client piece (SAND Internet Browser) as a Java application or an applet.",
                "This way, users across various platforms can continuously access large spatial data on a remote location with little or 15 no need for any preceding software installation.",
                "The second option is to use a stand-alone SAND Internet Browser along with a locally-installed Internet-enabled database management system (server piece).",
                "In this case, the SAND Internet Browser can still be utilized to view data from remote locations.",

                "Power users can also upload large volumes of spatial data back to the remote server using this enhanced client.",
                "We focused our efforts in two directions.",
                "We first aimed at developing a client-server architecture with efficient caching methods to balance local resources on one side and the significant latency of the network connection on the other.",
                "The low bandwidth of this connection is the primary concern in both cases.",
                "The outcome of this research primarily addresses the issues of our first type of usage (i.e., as a remote browser application or an applet) for our browser and other similar applications.",

                "We have developed a centralized peerto-peer approach to provide the users with the ability to transfer large volumes of data (i.e., whole data sets to the local database) more efficiently by better utilizing the distributed network resources among active clients of a clientserver architecture.",
                "We call this architecture APPOINTApproach for Peer-to-Peer Oﬄoading the INTernet.",
                "The results of this research addresses primarily the issues of the second type of usage for our SAND Internet Browser (i.e., as a stand-alone application).",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 describes our client-server approach in more detail.",
                "Section 3 focuses on APPOINT, our peer-to-peer approach.",

                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
                "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
                "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
                "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
                "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
                "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
                "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
                "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",
                "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
                "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",
                "Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space.",
                "The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact.",
                "APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers.",
                "This achieves platform independence and easy deployment of the system.",
                "APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures.",
                "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service.",
                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
                "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",
                "This will enable APPOINT to treat the server as one of the peers.",
                "The two callback methods of the server are invoked when a file is received from a client, or when an error is encountered while receiving a file from a client.",
                "APPOINT guar7 Figure 2: The localization operation in APPOINT. antees that at least one of the callbacks will be called so that the user (who may not be online anymore) can always be notified (i.e., via email).",
                "Clients localizing large data files can make these files available to the public by using the makeFileAvailable method on the client side.",
                "For example, in our SAND Internet Browser, we have the localization of spatial data as a function that can be chosen from our menus.",
                "This functionality enables users to download data sets completely to their local disks before starting their queries or analysis.",

                "The solution presented by most of these vendors is based on performing all the calculations on the server side and transferring only bitmaps that represent results of user queries and commands.",
                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",
                "Work described in [9] examines a client-server architecture for viewing large images that operates over a lowbandwidth network connection.",
                "It presents a technique based on wavelet transformations that allows the minimization of the amount of data needed to be transferred over the network between the server and the client.",
                "In this case, while the server holds the full representation of the large image, only a limited amount of data needs to be transferred to the client to enable it to display a currently requested view into the image.",
                "On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations.",
                "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",
                "This also allows dropping unnecessary parts of the image from the main memory on the server.",
                "Other related work has been reported in [16] where a client-server architecture is described that is designed to provide end users with access to a server.",

                "In addition, in our case, the user community that accesses a certain data file may also be very dispersed from a network point of view and thus cannot take advantage of any of the caching schemes.",

                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",

                "This is a concept similar to caching.",

                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
                "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
                "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
                "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
                "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
                "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
                "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
                "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",
                "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
                "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",
                "Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space.",
                "The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact.",
                "APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers.",
                "This achieves platform independence and easy deployment of the system.",
                "APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures.",
                "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service.",
                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
                "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",

                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",

                "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",

                "This way, users across various platforms can continuously access large spatial data on a remote location with little or 15 no need for any preceding software installation.",
                "The second option is to use a stand-alone SAND Internet Browser along with a locally-installed Internet-enabled database management system (server piece).",
                "In this case, the SAND Internet Browser can still be utilized to view data from remote locations.",

                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
                "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
                "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
                "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
                "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
                "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
                "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
                "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",
                "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
                "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",
                "Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space.",
                "The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact.",
                "APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers.",
                "This achieves platform independence and easy deployment of the system.",
                "APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures.",
                "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service.",
                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
                "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",
                "This will enable APPOINT to treat the server as one of the peers.",
                "The two callback methods of the server are invoked when a file is received from a client, or when an error is encountered while receiving a file from a client.",
                "APPOINT guar7 Figure 2: The localization operation in APPOINT. antees that at least one of the callbacks will be called so that the user (who may not be online anymore) can always be notified (i.e., via email).",
                "Clients localizing large data files can make these files available to the public by using the makeFileAvailable method on the client side.",
                "For example, in our SAND Internet Browser, we have the localization of spatial data as a function that can be chosen from our menus.",
                "This functionality enables users to download data sets completely to their local disks before starting their queries or analysis.",
                "In our implementation, we have calls to the APPOINT service both on the client and the server sides as mentioned above.",
                "Hence, when a localization request comes to the SAND Internet Browser, the browser leaves the decisions to optimally find and localize a data set to the APPOINT service.",
                "Our server also makes its data files available over APPOINT.",
                "The mechanism for the localization operation is shown with more details from the APPOINT protocols in Figure 2.",
                "The upload operation is performed in a similar fashion. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK There has been a substantial amount of research on remote access to spatial data.",
                "One specific approach has been adopted by numerous Web-based mapping services (MapQuest [5], MapsOnUs [6], etc.).",
                "The goal in this approach is to enable remote users, typically only equipped with standard Web browsers, to access the companys spatial database server and retrieve information in the form of pictorial maps from them.",
                "The solution presented by most of these vendors is based on performing all the calculations on the server side and transferring only bitmaps that represent results of user queries and commands.",
                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",
                "Work described in [9] examines a client-server architecture for viewing large images that operates over a lowbandwidth network connection.",
                "It presents a technique based on wavelet transformations that allows the minimization of the amount of data needed to be transferred over the network between the server and the client.",
                "In this case, while the server holds the full representation of the large image, only a limited amount of data needs to be transferred to the client to enable it to display a currently requested view into the image.",
                "On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations.",
                "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",
                "This also allows dropping unnecessary parts of the image from the main memory on the server.",
                "Other related work has been reported in [16] where a client-server architecture is described that is designed to provide end users with access to a server.",

                "From our perspective, although APPOINT employs some of the techniques used in peer-to-peer systems, it is also closely related to current Web caching architectures.",

                "Collaborative Web caching systems, the most relevant of these for our research, focus on creating either a hierarchical, hash-based, central directory-based, or multicast-based caching schemes.",
                "We do not compete with these approaches.",
                "In fact, APPOINT can work in tandem with collaborative Web caching if they are deployed together.",
                "We try to address the situation where a request arrives at a server, meaning all the caches report a miss.",
                "Hence, the point where the server is reached can be used to take a central decision but then the actual service request can be forwarded to a set of active clients, i.e., the down8 load and upload operations.",
                "Cache misses are especially common in the type of large data-based services on which we are working.",
                "Most of the Web caching schemes that are in use today employ a replacement policy that gives a priority to replacing the largest sized items over smaller-sized ones.",
                "Hence, these policies would lead to the immediate replacement of our relatively large data files even though they may be used frequently.",
                "In addition, in our case, the user community that accesses a certain data file may also be very dispersed from a network point of view and thus cannot take advantage of any of the caching schemes.",

                "Upon completion of this step of our work, we also plan to run comprehensive performance studies on our methods.",
                "Another issue is how to access data from different sources in different formats.",
                "In order to access multiple data sources in real time, it is desirable to look for a mechanism that would support data exchange by design.",
                "The XML protocol [3] has emerged to become virtually a standard for describing and communicating arbitrary data.",

                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the <br>sand</br> spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: <br>sand</br> Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the <br>sand</br> Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the <br>sand</br> kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the <br>sand</br> Internet Browser with the <br>sand</br> kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the <br>sand</br>-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these <br>sand</br>-Tcl commands or scripts to the <br>sand</br> kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the <br>sand</br> traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the <br>sand</br> servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding <br>sand</br>-Tcl expression or script in the <br>sand</br> kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the <br>sand</br> server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",

                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",

                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",

                "Para comunicarse con el servidor, cuya interfaz de programación de aplicaciones (API) es un lenguaje de secuencias de comandos basado en TCL, se requiere un servlet diseñado específicamente para interactuar el navegador de Internet \"Sand\" con el núcleo \"Sand\" en el lado del servidor.",

                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
                "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
                "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
                "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
                "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
                "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
                "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
                "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",
                "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
                "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",

                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",

                "On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations.",
                "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",

                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 describes our client-server approach in more detail.",
                "Section 3 focuses on APPOINT, our peer-to-peer approach.",
                "Section 4 discusses our work in relation to existing work.",
                "Section 5 outlines a sample SAND Internet Browser scenario for both of our remote access approaches.",
                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
                "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
                "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
                "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
                "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
                "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
                "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
                "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",
                "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
                "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",
                "Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space.",
                "The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact.",
                "APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers.",
                "This achieves platform independence and easy deployment of the system.",
                "APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures.",
                "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service.",
                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
                "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",
                "This will enable APPOINT to treat the server as one of the peers.",
                "The two callback methods of the server are invoked when a file is received from a client, or when an error is encountered while receiving a file from a client.",
                "APPOINT guar7 Figure 2: The localization operation in APPOINT. antees that at least one of the callbacks will be called so that the user (who may not be online anymore) can always be notified (i.e., via email).",
                "Clients localizing large data files can make these files available to the public by using the makeFileAvailable method on the client side.",
                "For example, in our SAND Internet Browser, we have the localization of spatial data as a function that can be chosen from our menus.",
                "This functionality enables users to download data sets completely to their local disks before starting their queries or analysis.",
                "In our implementation, we have calls to the APPOINT service both on the client and the server sides as mentioned above.",
                "Hence, when a localization request comes to the SAND Internet Browser, the browser leaves the decisions to optimally find and localize a data set to the APPOINT service.",
                "Our server also makes its data files available over APPOINT.",
                "The mechanism for the localization operation is shown with more details from the APPOINT protocols in Figure 2.",
                "The upload operation is performed in a similar fashion. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK There has been a substantial amount of research on remote access to spatial data.",
                "One specific approach has been adopted by numerous Web-based mapping services (MapQuest [5], MapsOnUs [6], etc.).",
                "The goal in this approach is to enable remote users, typically only equipped with standard Web browsers, to access the companys spatial database server and retrieve information in the form of pictorial maps from them.",
                "The solution presented by most of these vendors is based on performing all the calculations on the server side and transferring only bitmaps that represent results of user queries and commands.",
                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",
                "Work described in [9] examines a client-server architecture for viewing large images that operates over a lowbandwidth network connection.",
                "It presents a technique based on wavelet transformations that allows the minimization of the amount of data needed to be transferred over the network between the server and the client.",
                "In this case, while the server holds the full representation of the large image, only a limited amount of data needs to be transferred to the client to enable it to display a currently requested view into the image.",
                "On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations.",
                "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",
                "This also allows dropping unnecessary parts of the image from the main memory on the server.",
                "Other related work has been reported in [16] where a client-server architecture is described that is designed to provide end users with access to a server.",
                "It is assumed that this data server manages vast databases that are impractical to be stored on individual clients.",

                "In addition, in our case, the user community that accesses a certain data file may also be very dispersed from a network point of view and thus cannot take advantage of any of the caching schemes.",

                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
                "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
                "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
                "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
                "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
                "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
                "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
                "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",
                "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
                "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",
                "Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space.",
                "The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact.",
                "APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers.",
                "This achieves platform independence and easy deployment of the system.",
                "APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures.",
                "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service.",
                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
                "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",
                "This will enable APPOINT to treat the server as one of the peers.",
                "The two callback methods of the server are invoked when a file is received from a client, or when an error is encountered while receiving a file from a client.",
                "APPOINT guar7 Figure 2: The localization operation in APPOINT. antees that at least one of the callbacks will be called so that the user (who may not be online anymore) can always be notified (i.e., via email).",
                "Clients localizing large data files can make these files available to the public by using the makeFileAvailable method on the client side.",
                "For example, in our SAND Internet Browser, we have the localization of spatial data as a function that can be chosen from our menus.",
                "This functionality enables users to download data sets completely to their local disks before starting their queries or analysis.",
                "In our implementation, we have calls to the APPOINT service both on the client and the server sides as mentioned above.",
                "Hence, when a localization request comes to the SAND Internet Browser, the browser leaves the decisions to optimally find and localize a data set to the APPOINT service.",
                "Our server also makes its data files available over APPOINT.",
                "The mechanism for the localization operation is shown with more details from the APPOINT protocols in Figure 2.",

                "In fact, as long as the user explores one re<br>gi</br>on at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a <br>gi</br>ven port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the ori<br>gi</br>nating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",

                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",

                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",

                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",

                "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
                "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",
                "Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space.",
                "The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact.",
                "APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers.",

                "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service.",
                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
                "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",

                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",

                "The system can start being utilized immediately without any prior setup which can be extremely beneficial in time-sensitive usage scenarios such as emergencies.",

                "First, any standard Web browser can be used to retrieve and run the client piece (SAND <br>internet</br> Browser) as a Java application or an applet.",
                "This way, users across various platforms can continuously access large spatial data on a remote location with little or 15 no need for any preceding software installation.",
                "The second option is to use a stand-alone SAND <br>internet</br> Browser along with a locally-installed <br>internet</br>-enabled database management system (server piece).",

                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the <br>internet</br>).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND <br>internet</br> Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND <br>internet</br> Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND <br>internet</br> Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND <br>internet</br> Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
                "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
                "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
                "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
                "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
                "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
                "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
                "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",

                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",

                "The solution presented by most of these vendors is based on performing all the calculations on the server side and transferring only bitmaps that represent results of user queries and commands.",
                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",
                "Work described in [9] examines a client-server architecture for viewing large images that operates over a lowbandwidth network connection.",
                "It presents a technique based on wavelet transformations that allows the minimization of the amount of data needed to be transferred over the network between the server and the client.",
                "In this case, while the server holds the full representation of the large image, only a limited amount of data needs to be transferred to the client to enable it to display a currently requested view into the image.",
                "On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations.",
                "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",
                "This also allows dropping unnecessary parts of the image from the main memory on the server.",
                "Other related work has been reported in [16] where a client-server architecture is described that is designed to provide end users with access to a server.",

                "From our perspective, although APPOINT employs some of the techniques used in peer-to-peer systems, it is also closely related to current Web caching architectures.",

                "Most of the Web caching schemes that are in use today employ a replacement policy that gives a priority to replacing the largest sized items over smaller-sized ones.",

                "In addition, in our case, the user community that accesses a certain data file may also be very dispersed from a network point of view and thus cannot take advantage of any of the caching schemes.",

                "We enable the minimization of the requirements for system resources on the client side while maximizing system responsiveness as well as the number of connections one server can handle concurrently.",
                "Second, for prolonged periods of access to large online data, we introduce APPOINT (an Approach for Peer-to-Peer Oﬄoading the INTernet).",
                "This is a centralized peer-to-peer approach that helps Internet users transfer large volumes of online data efficiently.",
                "In APPOINT, active clients of the clientserver architecture act on the servers behalf and communicate with each other to decrease network latency, improve service bandwidth, and resolve server congestions.",

                "INTRODUCTION In recent years, enterprises in the public and private sectors have provided access to large volumes of spatial data over the Internet.",
                "Interactive work with such large volumes of online spatial data is a challenging task.",
                "We have been developing an interactive browser for accessing spatial online databases: the SAND (Spatial and Non-spatial Data) Internet Browser.",
                "Users of this browser can interactively and visually manipulate spatial data remotely.",
                "Unfortunately, interactive remote access to spatial data slows to a crawl without proper data access mechanisms.",
                "We developed two separate methods for improving the system performance, together, form a dynamic network infrastructure that is highly scalable and provides a satisfactory user experience for interactions with large volumes of online spatial data.",
                "The core functionality responsible for the actual database operations is performed by the server-based SAND system.",
                "SAND is a spatial database system developed at the University of Maryland [12].",
                "The client-side SAND Internet Browser provides a graphical user interface to the facilities of SAND over the Internet.",
                "Users specify queries by choosing the desired selection conditions from a variety of menus and dialog boxes.",
                "SAND Internet Browser is Java-based, which makes it deployable across many platforms.",
                "In addition, since Java has often been installed on target computers beforehand, our clients can be deployed on these systems with little or no need for any additional software installation or customization.",
                "The system can start being utilized immediately without any prior setup which can be extremely beneficial in time-sensitive usage scenarios such as emergencies.",
                "There are two ways to deploy SAND.",
                "First, any standard Web browser can be used to retrieve and run the client piece (SAND Internet Browser) as a Java application or an applet.",
                "This way, users across various platforms can continuously access large spatial data on a remote location with little or 15 no need for any preceding software installation.",
                "The second option is to use a stand-alone SAND Internet Browser along with a locally-installed Internet-enabled database management system (server piece).",
                "In this case, the SAND Internet Browser can still be utilized to view data from remote locations.",
                "However, frequently accessed data can be downloaded to the local database on demand, and subsequently accessed locally.",
                "Power users can also upload large volumes of spatial data back to the remote server using this enhanced client.",
                "We focused our efforts in two directions.",
                "We first aimed at developing a client-server architecture with efficient caching methods to balance local resources on one side and the significant latency of the network connection on the other.",
                "The low bandwidth of this connection is the primary concern in both cases.",
                "The outcome of this research primarily addresses the issues of our first type of usage (i.e., as a remote browser application or an applet) for our browser and other similar applications.",
                "The second direction aims at helping users that wish to manipulate large volumes of online data for prolonged periods.",
                "We have developed a centralized peerto-peer approach to provide the users with the ability to transfer large volumes of data (i.e., whole data sets to the local database) more efficiently by better utilizing the distributed network resources among active clients of a clientserver architecture.",
                "We call this architecture APPOINTApproach for Peer-to-Peer Oﬄoading the INTernet.",
                "The results of this research addresses primarily the issues of the second type of usage for our SAND Internet Browser (i.e., as a stand-alone application).",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 describes our client-server approach in more detail.",
                "Section 3 focuses on APPOINT, our peer-to-peer approach.",
                "Section 4 discusses our work in relation to existing work.",
                "Section 5 outlines a sample SAND Internet Browser scenario for both of our remote access approaches.",
                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE PEER-TO-PEER APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
                "In this case, making an initial investment of downloading the whole data set may be needed to guarantee a satisfactory session.",
                "Unfortunately, spatial data tends to be large.",
                "A few download requests to a large data set from a set of idle clients waiting to be served can slow the server to a crawl.",
                "This is due to the fact that the common client-server approach to transferring data between the two ends of a connection assumes a designated role for each one of the ends (i.e, some clients and a server).",
                "We built APPOINT as a centralized peer-to-peer system to demonstrate our approach for improving the common client-server systems.",
                "A server still exists.",
                "There is a central source for the data and a decision mechanism for the service.",
                "The environment still functions as a client-server environment under many circumstances.",
                "Yet, unlike many common client-server environments, APPOINT maintains more information about the clients.",
                "This includes, inventories of what each client downloads, their availabilities, etc.",
                "When the client-server service starts to perform poorly or a request for a data item comes from a client with a poor connection to the server, APPOINT can start appointing appropriate active clients of the system to serve on behalf of the server, i.e., clients who have already volunteered their services and can take on the role of peers (hence, moving from a client-server scheme to a peer-to-peer scheme).",
                "The directory service for the active clients is still performed by the server but the server no longer serves all of the requests.",
                "In this scheme, clients are used mainly for the purpose of sharing their networking resources rather than introducing new content and hence they help oﬄoad the server and scale up the service.",
                "The existence of a server is simpler in terms of management of dynamic peers in comparison to pure peerto-peer approaches where a flood of messages to discover who is still active in the system should be used by each peer that needs to make a decision.",
                "The server is also the main source of data and under regular circumstances it may not forward the service.",
                "Data is assumed to be formed of files.",
                "A single file forms the atomic means of communication.",
                "APPOINT optimizes requests with respect to these atomic requests.",
                "Frequently accessed data sets are replicated as a byproduct of having been requested by a large number of users.",
                "This opens up the potential for bypassing the server in future downloads for the data by other users as there are now many new points of access to it.",
                "Bypassing the server is useful when the servers bandwidth is limited.",
                "Existence of a server assures that unpopular data is also available at all times.",
                "The service depends on the availability of the server.",
                "The server is now more resilient to congestion as the service is more scalable.",
                "Backups and other maintenance activities are already being performed on the server and hence no extra administrative effort is needed for the dynamic peers.",
                "If a peer goes down, no extra precautions are taken.",
                "In fact, APPOINT does not require any additional resources from an already existing client-server environment but, instead, expands its capability.",
                "The peers simply get on to or get off from a table on the server.",
                "Uploading data is achieved in a similar manner as downloading data.",
                "For uploads, the active clients can again be utilized.",
                "Users can upload their data to a set of peers other than the server if the server is busy or resides in a distant location.",
                "Eventually the data is propagated to the server.",
                "All of the operations are performed in a transparent fashion to the clients.",
                "Upon initial connection to the server, they can be queried as to whether or not they want to share their idle networking time and disk space.",
                "The rest of the operations follow transparently after the initial contact.",
                "APPOINT works on the application layer but not on lower layers.",
                "This achieves platform independence and easy deployment of the system.",
                "APPOINT is not a replacement but an addition to the current client-server architectures.",
                "We developed a library of function calls that when placed in a client-server architecture starts the service.",
                "We are developing advanced peer selection schemes that incorporate the location of active clients, bandwidth among active clients, data-size to be transferred, load on active clients, and availability of active clients to form a complete means of selecting the best clients that can become efficient alternatives to the server.",
                "With APPOINT we are defining a very simple API that could be used within an existing client-server system easily.",
                "Instead of denial of service or a slow connection, this API can be utilized to forward the service appropriately.",
                "The API for the server side is: start(serverPortNo) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) callback receivedFile(file,location) callback errorReceivingFile(file,location,error) stop() Similarly the API for the client side is: start(clientPortNo,serverPortNo,serverAddress) makeFileAvailable(file,location,boolean) receiveFile(file,location) sendFile(file,location) stop() The server, after starting the APPOINT service, can make all of the data files available to the clients by using the makeFileAvailable method.",
                "This will enable APPOINT to treat the server as one of the peers.",
                "The two callback methods of the server are invoked when a file is received from a client, or when an error is encountered while receiving a file from a client.",
                "APPOINT guar7 Figure 2: The localization operation in APPOINT. antees that at least one of the callbacks will be called so that the user (who may not be online anymore) can always be notified (i.e., via email).",
                "Clients localizing large data files can make these files available to the public by using the makeFileAvailable method on the client side.",
                "For example, in our SAND Internet Browser, we have the localization of spatial data as a function that can be chosen from our menus.",
                "This functionality enables users to download data sets completely to their local disks before starting their queries or analysis.",
                "In our implementation, we have calls to the APPOINT service both on the client and the server sides as mentioned above.",
                "Hence, when a localization request comes to the SAND Internet Browser, the browser leaves the decisions to optimally find and localize a data set to the APPOINT service.",
                "Our server also makes its data files available over APPOINT.",
                "The mechanism for the localization operation is shown with more details from the APPOINT protocols in Figure 2.",
                "The upload operation is performed in a similar fashion. 4.",
                "RELATED WORK There has been a substantial amount of research on remote access to spatial data.",
                "One specific approach has been adopted by numerous Web-based mapping services (MapQuest [5], MapsOnUs [6], etc.).",
                "The goal in this approach is to enable remote users, typically only equipped with standard Web browsers, to access the companys spatial database server and retrieve information in the form of pictorial maps from them.",
                "The solution presented by most of these vendors is based on performing all the calculations on the server side and transferring only bitmaps that represent results of user queries and commands.",
                "Although the advantage of this solution is the minimization of both hardware and software resources on the client site, the resulting product has severe limitations in terms of available functionality and response time (each user action results in a new bitmap being transferred to the client).",
                "Work described in [9] examines a client-server architecture for viewing large images that operates over a lowbandwidth network connection.",
                "It presents a technique based on wavelet transformations that allows the minimization of the amount of data needed to be transferred over the network between the server and the client.",
                "In this case, while the server holds the full representation of the large image, only a limited amount of data needs to be transferred to the client to enable it to display a currently requested view into the image.",
                "On the client side, the image is reconstructed into a pyramid representation to speed up zooming and panning operations.",
                "Both the client and the server keep a common mask that indicates what parts of the image are available on the client and what needs to be requested.",
                "This also allows dropping unnecessary parts of the image from the main memory on the server.",
                "Other related work has been reported in [16] where a client-server architecture is described that is designed to provide end users with access to a server.",
                "It is assumed that this data server manages vast databases that are impractical to be stored on individual clients.",
                "This work blends raster data management (stored in pyramids [22]) with vector data stored in quadtrees [19, 20].",
                "For our peer-to-peer transfer approach (APPOINT), Napster is the forefather where a directory service is centralized on a server and users exchange music files that they have stored on their local disks.",
                "Our application domain, where the data is already freely available to the public, forms a prime candidate for such a peer-to-peer approach.",
                "Gnutella is a pure (decentralized) peer-to-peer file exchange system.",
                "Unfortunately, it suffers from scalability issues, i.e., floods of messages between peers in order to map connectivity in the system are required.",
                "Other systems followed these popular systems, each addressing a different flavor of sharing over the Internet.",
                "Many peer-to-peer storage systems have also recently emerged.",
                "PAST [18], Eternity Service [7], CFS [10], and OceanStore [15] are some peer-to-peer storage systems.",
                "Some of these systems have focused on anonymity while others have focused on persistence of storage.",
                "Also, other approaches, like SETI@Home [21], made other resources, such as idle CPUs, work together over the Internet to solve large scale computational problems.",
                "Our goal is different than these approaches.",
                "With APPOINT, we want to improve existing client-server systems in terms of performance by using idle networking resources among active clients.",
                "Hence, other issues like anonymity, decentralization, and persistence of storage were less important in our decisions.",
                "Confirming the authenticity of the indirectly delivered data sets is not yet addressed with APPOINT.",

                "Collaborative Web caching systems, the most relevant of these for our research, focus on creating either a hierarchical, hash-based, central directory-based, or multicast-based caching schemes.",
                "We do not compete with these approaches.",
                "In fact, APPOINT can work in tandem with collaborative Web caching if they are deployed together.",
                "We try to address the situation where a request arrives at a server, meaning all the caches report a miss.",
                "Hence, the point where the server is reached can be used to take a central decision but then the actual service request can be forwarded to a set of active clients, i.e., the down8 load and upload operations.",
                "Cache misses are especially common in the type of large data-based services on which we are working.",
                "Most of the Web caching schemes that are in use today employ a replacement policy that gives a priority to replacing the largest sized items over smaller-sized ones.",
                "Hence, these policies would lead to the immediate replacement of our relatively large data files even though they may be used frequently.",
                "In addition, in our case, the user community that accesses a certain data file may also be very dispersed from a network point of view and thus cannot take advantage of any of the caching schemes.",

                "Upon completion of this step of our work, we also plan to run comprehensive performance studies on our methods.",
                "Another issue is how to access data from different sources in different formats.",
                "In order to access multiple data sources in real time, it is desirable to look for a mechanism that would support data exchange by design.",

                "Section 6 contains concluding remarks as well as future research directions. 2.",
                "THE CLIENT-SERVER APPROACH Traditionally, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) such as ArcInfo from ESRI [2] and many spatial databases are designed to be stand-alone products.",
                "The spatial database is kept on the same computer or local area network from where it is visualized and queried.",
                "This architecture allows for instantaneous transfer of large amounts of data between the spatial database and the visualization module so that it is perfectly reasonable to use large-bandwidth protocols for communication between them.",
                "There are however many applications where a more distributed approach is desirable.",
                "In these cases, the database is maintained in one location while users need to work with it from possibly distant sites over the network (e.g., the Internet).",
                "These connections can be far slower and less reliable than local area networks and thus it is desirable to limit the data flow between the database (server) and the visualization unit (client) in order to get a timely response from the system.",
                "Our client-server approach (Figure 1) allows the actual database engine to be run in a central location maintained by spatial database experts, while end users acquire a Javabased client component that provides them with a gateway into the SAND spatial database engine.",
                "Our client is more than a simple image viewer.",
                "Instead, it operates on vector data allowing the client to execute many operations such as zooming or locational queries locally.",
                "In Figure 1: SAND Internet Browser - Client-Server architecture. essence, a simple spatial database engine is run on the client.",
                "This database keeps a copy of a subset of the whole database whose full version is maintained on the server.",
                "This is a concept similar to caching.",
                "In our case, the client acts as a lightweight server in that given data, it evaluates queries and provides the visualization module with objects to be displayed.",
                "It initiates communication with the server only in cases where it does not have enough data stored locally.",
                "Since the locally run database is only updated when additional or newer data is needed, our architecture allows the system to minimize the network traffic between the client and the server when executing the most common user-side operations such as zooming and panning.",
                "In fact, as long as the user explores one region at a time (i.e., he or she is not panning all over the database), no additional data needs to be retrieved after the initial population of the client-side database.",
                "This makes the system much more responsive than the Web mapping services.",
                "Due to the complexity of evaluating arbitrary queries (i.e., more complex queries than window queries that are needed for database visualization), we do not perform user-specified queries on the client.",
                "All user queries are still evaluated on the server side and the results are downloaded onto the client for display.",
                "However, assuming that the queries are selective enough (i.e., there are far fewer elements returned from the query than the number of elements in the database), the response delay is usually within reasonable limits. 2.1 Client-Server Communication As mentioned above, the SAND Internet Browser is a client piece of the remotely accessible spatial database server built around the SAND kernel.",
                "In order to communicate with the server, whose application programming interface (API) is a Tcl-based scripting language, a servlet specifically designed to interface the SAND Internet Browser with the SAND kernel is required on the server side.",
                "This servlet listens on a given port of the server for incoming requests from the client.",
                "It translates these requests into the SAND-Tcl language.",
                "Next, it transmits these SAND-Tcl commands or scripts to the SAND kernel.",
                "After results are provided by the kernel, the servlet fetches and processes them, and then sends those results back to the originating client.",
                "Once the Java servlet is launched, it waits for a client to initiate a connection.",
                "It handles both requests for the actual client Java code (needed when the client is run as an applet) and the SAND traffic.",
                "When the client piece is launched, it connects back to the SAND servlet, the communication is driven by the client piece; the server only responds to the clients queries.",
                "The client initiates a transaction by 6 sending a query.",
                "The Java servlet parses the query and creates a corresponding SAND-Tcl expression or script in the SAND kernels native format.",
                "It is then sent to the kernel for evaluation or execution.",
                "The kernels response naturally depends on the query and can be a boolean value, a number or a string representing a value (e.g., a default color) or, a whole tuple (e.g., in response to a nearest tuple query).",
                "If a script was sent to the kernel (e.g., requesting all the tuples matching some criteria), then an arbitrary amount of data can be returned by the SAND server.",
                "In this case, the data is first compressed before it is sent over the network to the client.",
                "The data stream gets decompressed at the client before the results are parsed.",
                "Notice, that if another spatial database was to be used instead of the SAND kernel, then only a simple modification to the servlet would need to be made in order for the SAND Internet Browser to function properly.",
                "In particular, the queries sent by the client would need to be recoded into another query language which is native to this different spatial database.",
                "The format of the protocol used for communication between the servlet and the client is unaffected. 3.",
                "THE <br>peer-to-peer</br> APPROACH Many users may want to work on a complete spatial data set for a prolonged period of time.",
