In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine. More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation. We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible. The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums. Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described. Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.

INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries. As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want. There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g. Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g. Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3]. We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow. Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors. This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities. Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked. For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data. Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences). This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities. However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains. High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions. For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers. Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships. This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos. Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums. Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search. Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively. We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships. Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12]. We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods. We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation. In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images. However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24]. This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search. On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content. To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine. The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories. Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds. However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem. Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality. For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity. However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image. Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future. Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos. Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine. In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos. In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers. These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results. More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos. The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem. Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums. In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums. Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum. However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine. To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums. That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums. We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization. The main contributions of this paper are: 1. We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2. We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research. In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm. Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4. It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2. ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom. The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object. For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales. It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem. The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums. That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums. Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation. Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums. This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity. In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos. The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations. Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed. Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work). Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums. Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space. This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences. By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem. For convenience, the following notations are employed. Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively. The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores. Suppose there are a total of K Web sites. We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites. In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites. The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration. Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum. The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be. In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one. But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results. Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea. The Web Community 1 is the reference community. The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same. The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models. So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines. We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work. Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large. In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums. Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5. Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods. In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings. This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums. It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval. We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score. The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed. Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity. The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums. The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores. The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers. To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method. Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score. And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score. This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent. The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums. Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum. We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community. Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters. This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski. Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki. For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune. Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical. It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums. This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code). Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n). The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids. Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built. The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system. Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise. Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space. Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids. The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs. Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum. More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3. Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method. It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments. Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged. As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged. This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results. Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints. First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0. This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1. Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method. We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment. Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one. Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile). This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one. However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively. The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion. Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links. After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums? Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent? We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect. On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent. Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1. Here, we discuss some other related works. The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists. However, there are fundamental differences between them. First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall. Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1). In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query. Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases. Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12]. All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model. In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank. Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3. EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on high-quality photo search. We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1. Then we focus on how to rank photos from different Web forums. In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2. Then we try to find duplicate photos in section 3.3. Some intermediate results are discussed using δ measure in section 3.4. Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable. For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3). As for Issue 3, we devise the interface of the system deliberately in order to smooth the users process of enjoying high-quality photos. Techniques, such as Fisheye and slides show, are utilized in current system. Figure 5 shows the interface. We will not talk more about this issue as it is not an emphasis of this paper. Figure 5: EnjoyPhoto: an enjoyable high-quality photo search engine, where 26,477 records are returned for the query fall in about 0.421 seconds As for Issue 1, we extracted from a commercial search engine a subset of photos coming from various photo forums all over the world, and explicitly parsed the Web pages containing these photos. The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million. After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings. All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11]. In current system, the ranking function was specifically tuned to emphasize title, categorization, and rating information. Issue 2 is essentially dealt with in the following sections which derive the quality of photos by analyzing ratings provided by various Web photo forums. Here we chose six photo forums to study the ranking problem and denote them as Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E and Web-F. 3.2 Photo Score Normalization Detailed analysis of different score normalization methods are analyzed in this section. In this analysis, the zero 1 Digital cameras save JPEG (.jpg) files with EXIF (Exchangeable Image File) data. Camera settings and scene information are recorded by the camera into the image file. www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Normalized Score TotalNumber (c) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (e) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (f) Web-F Figure 6: Distributions of mean scores normalized to [0, 10] scores that usually occupy about than 30% of the total number of photos for some Web forums are not currently taken into account. How to utilize these photos is left for future explorations. In Figure 6, we list the distributions of the mean score, which is transformed to a fixed interval [0, 10]. The distributions of the average scores of these Web forums look quite different. Distributions in Figure 6(a), 6(b), and 6(e) looks like Gaussian distributions, while those in Figure 6(d) and 6(f) are dominated by the top score. The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems. In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales. Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores. Furthermore the average score is very likely to be spammed, if there are only a few users rating a photo. Figure 7 shows the total score normalization method by maximal and minimal scores, which is one of our base line system. All the total scores of a given Web forum are normalized to [0, 100] according to the maximal score and minimal score of corresponding Web forum. We notice that total score distribution of Web-A in Figure 7(a) has two larger tails than all the others. To show the shape of the distributions more clearly, we only show the distributions on [0, 25] in Figure 7(b),7(c),7(d),7(e), and 7(f). Figure 8 shows the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method, where the modes of the six distributions are normalized to 5 and the 90% percentile to 8. We can see that this normalization method makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent. The two proposed algorithms are all based on these normalization methods. 3.3 Duplicate photo detection Targeting at computational efficiency, the Dedup algorithm may lose some recall rate, but can achieve a high precision rate. We also focus on finding precise hidden links rather than all hidden links. Figure 9 shows some duplicate detection examples. The results are shown in Table 1 and verify that large numbers of duplicate photos exist in any two Web forums even with the strict condition for Dedup where we chose first 29 bits as the hash code. Since there are only a few parameters to estimate in the proposed fusion methods, the numbers of duplicate photos shown Table 1 are 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Normalized Score TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Normalized Score TotalNumber (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (f) Web-F Figure 7: Maxmin Normalization 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Normalized Score TotalNumber (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Normalized Score TotalNumber (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Normalized Score TotalNumber (f) Web-F Figure 8: Mode-90% Percentile Normalization sufficient to determine these parameters. The last table column lists the total number of photos in the corresponding Web forums. 3.4 δ Measure The parameters of the proposed linear and nonlinear algorithms are calculated using the duplicate data shown in Table 1, where the Web-C is chosen as the reference Web forum since it shares the most duplicate photos with other forums. Table 2 and 3 show the δ measure on the linear model and nonlinear model. As δkl is symmetric and δkk = 0, we only show the upper triangular part. The NaN values in both tables lie in that no duplicate photos have been detected by the Dedup algorithm as reported in Table 1. The linear model guarantees that the δ measures related Table 1: Number of duplicate photos between each pair of Web forums A B C D E F Scale A 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k B 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675k C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D 178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155k E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448k F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122k 383 Figure 9: Some results of duplicate photo detection Table 2: δ measure on the linear model.

It is indeed the case (see the underlined numbers in Table 2). But this model can not guarantee that the δ measures on the non-reference communities can also be no less than 0, as the normalization steps are based on duplicate photos between the reference community and a nonreference community. Results shows that all the numbers in the δ measure are greater than 0 (see all the non-underlined numbers in Table 2), which indicates that it is probable that this model will give optimal results. On the contrary, the nonlinear model does not guarantee that δ measures related to the reference community should be no less than 0, as not all duplicate photos between the two Web forums can be used when optimizing this model. In fact, the duplicate photos that lie in different intervals will not be used in this model. It is these specific duplicate photos that make the δ measure negative. As a result, there are both negative and positive items in Table 3, but overall the number of positive ones are greater than negative ones (9:5), that indicates the model may be better than the normalization only method (see next subsection) which has an all-zero δ measure, and worse than the linear model. 3.5 User Study Because it is hard to find an objective criterion to evaluate Table 3: δ measure on the nonlinear model.

Ten subjects were invited to participate in the user study. They were recruited from nearby universities. As search engines of both text search and image search are familiar to university students, there was no prerequisite criterion for choosing students. We conducted user studies using Internet Explorer 6.0 on Windows XP with 17-inch LCD monitors set at 1,280 pixels by 1,024 pixels in 32-bit color. Data was recorded with server logs and paper-based surveys after each task. Figure 10: User study interface We specifically device an interface for user study as shown in Figure 10. For each pair of fusion methods, participants were encouraged to try any query they wished. For those without specific ideas, two combo boxes (category list and query list) were listed on the bottom panel, where the top 1,000 image search queries from a commercial search engine were provided. After a participant submitted a query, the system randomly selected the left or right frame to display each of the two ranking results. The participant were then required to judge which ranking result was better of the two ranking results, or whether the two ranking results were of equal quality, and submit the judgment by choosing the corresponding radio button and clicking the Submit button. For example, in Figure 10, query sunset is submitted to the system. Then, 79,092 photos were returned and ranked by the Minmax fusion method in the left frame and linear fusion method in the right frame. A participant then compares the two ranking results (without knowing the ranking methods) and submits his/her feedback by choosing answers in the Your option. Table 4: Results of user study Norm.Only Manually Linear Linear 29:13:10 14:22:15Nonlinear 29:15:9 12:27:12 6:4:45 Table 4 shows the experimental results, where Linear denotes the linear fusion method, Nonlinear denotes the non linear fusion method, Norm. Only means Maxmin normalization method, Manually means the manually tuned method. The three numbers in each item, say 29:13:10, mean that 29 judgments prefer the linear fusion results, 10 384 judgments prefer the normalization only method, and 13 judgments consider these two methods as equivalent. We conduct the ANOVA analysis, and obtain the following conclusions: 1. Both the linear and nonlinear methods are significantly better than the Norm. Only method with respective P-values 0.00165(< 0.05) and 0.00073(<< 0.05). This result is consistent with the δ-measure evaluation result. The Norm. Only method assumes that the top 10% photos in different forums are of the same quality. However, this assumption does not stand in general. For example, a top 10% photo in a top tier photo forum is generally of higher quality than a top 10% photo in a second-tier photo forum. This is similar to that, those top 10% students in a top-tier university and those in a second-tier university are generally of different quality. Both linear and nonlinear fusion methods acknowledge the existence of such differences and aim at quantizing the differences. Therefore, they perform better than the Norm. Only method. 2. The linear fusion method is significantly better than the nonlinear one with P-value 1.195 × 10−10 . This result is rather surprising as this more complicated ranking method is expected to tune the ranking more finely than the linear one. The main reason for this result may be that it is difficult to find the best intervals where the nonlinear tuning should be carried out and yet simply the middle part of the Mode-90% Percentile Normalization method was chosen. The timeconsuming and subjective evaluation methods - user studies - blocked us extensively tuning these parameters. 3. The proposed linear and nonlinear methods perform almost the same with or slightly better than the manually tuned method. Given that the linear/nonlinear fusion methods are fully automatic approaches, they are considered practical and efficient solutions when more communities (e.g. dozens of communities) need to be integrated. 4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper, we studied the Web object-ranking problem in the cases of lacking object relationships where traditional ranking algorithms are no longer valid, and took high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation. We have built a vertical high-quality photo search engine, and proposed score fusion methods which can automatically integrate as many data sources (Web forums) as possible. The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by duplicate photo detection algorithm, and minimize score differences of duplicate photos in different forums. Both the intermediate results and the user studies show that the proposed fusion methods are a practical and efficient solution to Web object ranking in the aforesaid relationships. Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other kinds of Web objects including video clips, poems, short stories, music, drawings, sculptures, and so on. Current system is far from being perfect. In order to make this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the vertical domain (e.g., Web photo forums) are needed. The following points, for example, may improve the searching results and will be our future work: 1. more subtle analysis and then utilization of different kinds of ratings (e.g., novelty ratings, aesthetic ratings); 2. differentiating various communities who may have different interests and preferences or even distinct culture understandings; 3. incorporating more useful information, including photographers and reviewers information, to model the photos in a heterogeneous data space instead of the current homogeneous one. We will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend relevant high-quality photos to browsers. One open problem is whether we can find an objective and efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning parameters in one algorithm. 5.

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información; G.2.2 [Matemáticas Discretas]: Teoría de Grafos; H.3.5 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Servicios de Información en Línea - Servicios basados en la web Términos Generales Algoritmos, Experimentación 1. A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de objetos web en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2. ALGORITMO 2.1 Resumen La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web radica en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente existen dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros utilizan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros utilizan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o de 10 puntos. Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero un análisis detallado de los datos y experimentos muestra que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, la misma puntuación no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. De manera intuitiva, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos establecer relaciones entre cualquier par de foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante la normalización y transformación de puntuaciones. Afortunadamente, descubrimos que existe un buen número de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos en la web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de obtener una amplia difusión. En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente de detección de fotos duplicadas [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Ante la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se requiere un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como el foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas deberían ser iguales aunque estén en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes foros, excepto en el foro de referencia, pueden variar en un espacio paramétrico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntuación. Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer que las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas en foros no de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible a las del foro de referencia, podemos resolver eficazmente el problema de clasificación. Para mayor comodidad, se emplean las siguientes notaciones. Ski y ¯Ski denotan la puntuación total y la puntuación media del i-ésimo objeto web (foto) en el k-ésimo sitio web, respectivamente. La puntuación total se refiere a la suma de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación (por ejemplo, la puntuación de novedad y la puntuación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Además, utilizamos {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} para denotar el conjunto de puntuaciones de objetos web (fotos) en los foros web k-ésimos que son duplicados con los foros web l-ésimos, donde Ikl es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusión de puntuaciones se puede ver como el procedimiento de encontrar K transformaciones ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K de manera que eSki se pueda utilizar para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma un subgrafo, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas). El párrafo puede formularse como min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 como el foro de referencia y por lo tanto ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que puede establecerse heurísticamente según el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro no de referencia. Cuanto más revisores haya, más popular será la foto y mayor debería ser el peso correspondiente ¯wk i. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk i y simplemente los establecemos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk i, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea mencionada anteriormente. La Comunidad Web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web enlazados son en realidad el mismo. El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., K), el cual tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo a ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la Ecuación 1, se realiza la suma en todas las líneas punteadas rojas. Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en la Sección 2.2, que servirá como base para el trabajo siguiente. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método ajustado manualmente en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso impráctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar de manera precisa fotos duplicadas entre foros web. Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: Fusión lineal y Fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5. Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algunos otros trabajos relacionados. 2.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones Dado que los diferentes foros web (de fotos) en la web suelen tener diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión. Además, dado que existen muchos tipos de calificaciones, como calificaciones para novedad, calificaciones para estética, etc., es razonable elegir una común, como la puntuación total o la puntuación promedio, que siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calcular a partir de las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el método de normalización en la puntuación total o puntuación promedio sea visto como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar las puntuaciones promedio mediante su transformación lineal a un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntuación como Puntuación Media Escalada. La dificultad, sin embargo, de utilizar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que la puntuación promedio para el objeto sea manipulada o sesgada. La puntuación total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como la calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema radica en cómo normalizar las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros web. La forma más sencilla puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas. La desventaja de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos. Para hacer que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%. Aquí, la puntuación modal representa la puntuación total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total. Y El puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de las imágenes tiene un puntaje total más bajo. Este método de normalización utiliza la moda y el percentil 90 como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo en diferentes foros de fotografía, es que aunque las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar considerablemente y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad intermedia (desde la moda hasta el percentil 90) debería ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (rigurosidad) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel intermedio en un foro web suelen ocupar más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un análisis más detallado de las puntuaciones en la Sección 3.2. 2.3 Fusión Manual El foro de películas en la web, IMDB [16], propuso utilizar una función de clasificación bayesiana para normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación dentro de una comunidad. Motivados por esta función de clasificación, proponemos este método de fusión manual: Para el k-ésimo sitio web, utilizamos la siguiente fórmula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) para clasificar fotos, donde nk es el número de votos y n∗ k, S∗ k y αk son tres parámetros. Esta función de clasificación primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuación media original ¯Ski y una puntuación de referencia S∗ k para obtener una puntuación media ponderada que puede ser más confiable que ¯Ski. Entonces, la puntuación media ponderada se escala por αk para obtener la puntuación final fSki. Para n comunidades web, hay aproximadamente 3n parámetros en {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} para ajustar. Aunque este método puede lograr resultados bastante buenos después de ajustes manuales cuidadosos y exhaustivos en estos parámetros, cuando n se vuelve cada vez más grande, por ejemplo, si hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web rastreadas e indexadas, este método se volverá cada vez más laborioso y eventualmente se volverá impracticable. Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un método de fusión efectivo cuyos parámetros puedan determinarse automáticamente. 2.4 Detección de Fotos Duplicadas Utilizamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo eficiente y efectivo de detección de imágenes duplicadas, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre cualquier par de foros de fotos. Este algoritmo utiliza una función hash para mapear una característica de alta dimensión a un código hash de 32 bits (ver abajo para cómo construir el código hash). La complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imágenes duplicadas entre n imágenes es aproximadamente O(n log n). La característica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrículas regulares de k × k. Basándose en todas las características extraídas de la base de datos de imágenes, se construye un modelo de PCA. Las características visuales son luego transformadas a un espacio PCA de baja dimensionalidad y media cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema. Entonces, el código hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensión se transforma en uno si el valor en esta dimensión es mayor que 0, y en 0 en caso contrario. Las fotos en el mismo grupo se consideran posibles duplicados y se filtran aún más por un umbral en términos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de características visuales. La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde se extraen características visuales - valores de gris promedio - en cuadrículas de 6 × 6 y 7 × 7. Las características de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el código hash se genera de acuerdo a los signos. Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la detección de fotos duplicadas. 2.5 Fusión de Puntuaciones En esta sección, presentaremos dos soluciones sobre la fusión de puntuaciones basadas en diferentes suposiciones de forma paramétrica de ψk en la Ecuación 1. 2.5.1 Fusión Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas. Intuitivamente, la forma más directa de eliminar las incertidumbres causadas por los diferentes criterios es escalar, relativo a un centro dado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foto de foro web no referenciada con respecto al foro de referencia. Más estrictamente, asumimos que ψk tiene la siguiente forma ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones del foro k(= 1) deben escalarse por αk en relación al centro tk 1−αk, como se muestra en la Figura 3. Entonces, si sustituimos ψk anterior en la Ec. 1, obtenemos la siguiente función objetivo, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K donde f es la función objetivo definida en la Ec. 5, obtenemos la solución en forma cerrada como: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) donde Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un método de fusión lineal. Disfruta de la simplicidad y el excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos. Figura 3: Método de Fusión Lineal 2.5.2 Fusión No Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas A veces queremos un método que pueda ajustar puntuaciones en intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios. Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el método puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] dejando las puntuaciones C0 y C1 sin cambios. Este tipo de método de fusión es mucho más refinado que los lineales y contiene muchos más parámetros para ajustar y se espera que mejore aún más los resultados. Aquí proponemos una solución de fusión no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones. Primero, introducimos una transformación: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, si x ∈ (c0, c1] x en otro caso donde α > 0. Esta transformación satisface que para x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] con ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 y ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1. Luego podemos utilizar esta transformación no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figura 4: Método de fusión no lineal. Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento. Aunque no hay una solución en forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimización, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2, no es difícil obtener la solución numérica. Bajo las mismas suposiciones hechas en la Sección 2.2, podemos utilizar este método para ajustar las puntuaciones de nivel intermedio (desde el punto de la moda hasta el percentil 90). Se espera que este método de fusión no lineal más complicado logre mejores resultados que el lineal. Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parámetros de manera exhaustiva. Los experimentos actuales en la Sección 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple. 2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de fusión Dado que nuestra función objetivo es hacer que las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro no referencial y el foro de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible, es natural investigar qué tan cerca llegan a estar entre sí y cómo cambian las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web entre los dos foros no referenciales antes y después de la fusión de puntuaciones. Tomando la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la Comunidad Web 1) y un foro no de referencia, lo que corresponde a minimizar la función objetivo en los enlaces rojos discontinuos (ocultos). Después de la optimización, debemos preguntarnos qué sucede con las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros no de referencia. O, en otras palabras, ¿se vuelven más consistentes las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces verdes discontinuos (ocultos)? Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de rendimiento δ para cuantificar los cambios en las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web como δkl = Sim(Slk, Skl) - Sim(Slk ∗, Skl ∗) (10) donde Skl = (Skl 1, ..., Skl Ikl)T, Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1, ..., eSkl Ikl)T y Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b||. δkl > 0 significa que después de la fusión de puntuaciones, las puntuaciones en los mismos objetos web entre el k-ésimo y el l-ésimo foro web se vuelven más consistentes, lo cual es lo que esperamos. Por el contrario, si δkl < 0, esas puntuaciones se vuelven más inconsistentes. Aunque no podemos depender de esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusión, ya que clasificar fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificación intermedios y proporcionar información sobre el rendimiento final de diferentes métodos de clasificación. 2.6 Contrastes con Otros Trabajos Relacionados Ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los métodos propuestos con los métodos tradicionales, como PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y los algoritmos de LinkFusion [27] en la Sección 1. Aquí discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas. El problema actual también puede ser visto como un problema de agregación de rangos [13, 14] ya que tratamos con la cuestión de cómo combinar varias listas de rangos. Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos. En primer lugar, a diferencia de las páginas web, que pueden ser detectadas fácil y precisamente como las mismas páginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados con cierta precisión y recuperación. Segundo, los números de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeños en comparación con el total de conjuntos de fotos (ver Tabla 1). En otras palabras, las listas de clasificación de los K mejores de diferentes foros web son casi disjuntas para una consulta dada. Bajo esta condición, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como sus medidas - distancia de Kendall tau o distancia de la regla de Spearman - degenerarán en algunos casos triviales. Otra categoría de métodos de fusión de rangos (agregación) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automático, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12]. Todos estos métodos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo. En la configuración actual, es difícil o incluso imposible etiquetar estos conjuntos de datos según su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para clasificar. En cambio, el problema aquí es cómo combinar varias sub listas ordenadas para formar una lista de orden total. 3. EXPERIMENTOS En esta sección, llevamos a cabo nuestra investigación sobre la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. Primero presentamos brevemente el nuevo motor de búsqueda de imágenes verticales propuesto - EnjoyPhoto en la sección 3.1. Luego nos enfocamos en cómo clasificar fotos de diferentes foros web. Para hacerlo, primero normalizamos las puntuaciones (calificaciones) de las fotos de diferentes foros web múltiples en la sección 3.2. Luego intentamos encontrar fotos duplicadas en la sección 3.3. Algunos resultados intermedios se discuten utilizando la medida δ en la sección 3.4. Finalmente se lleva a cabo un conjunto de estudios de usuarios cuidadosamente para justificar nuestro método propuesto en la sección 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: Motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad Para cumplir con el requisito de los usuarios de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, proponemos y construimos un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad - EnjoyPhoto, que aborda los siguientes tres problemas clave: 1. cómo rastrear e indexar fotos, 2. cómo determinar las cualidades de cada foto y 3. cómo mostrar los resultados de búsqueda para hacer que el proceso de búsqueda sea agradable. Para una consulta de texto dada, este sistema clasifica las fotos basándose en una cierta combinación de la relevancia de la foto para esta consulta (Problema 1) y la calidad de la foto (Problema 2), y finalmente las muestra de una manera agradable (Problema 3). En cuanto al tema 3, diseñamos la interfaz del sistema deliberadamente para facilitar el proceso de los usuarios al disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Técnicas como Fisheye y presentación de diapositivas son utilizadas en el sistema actual. La Figura 5 muestra la interfaz. No hablaremos más sobre este tema ya que no es un énfasis de este documento. Figura 5: EnjoyPhoto: un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad y agradable, donde se devuelven 26,477 registros para la consulta de otoño en aproximadamente 0.421 segundos. En cuanto al tema 1, extraímos de un motor de búsqueda comercial un subconjunto de fotos procedentes de varios foros de fotos de todo el mundo, y analizamos explícitamente las páginas web que contienen estas fotos. El número de fotos en la colección de datos es de aproximadamente 2.5 millones. Después del análisis, cada foto se asoció con su título, categoría, descripción, configuración de la cámara, datos EXIF 1 (cuando estuvieran disponibles para imágenes digitales), ubicación (cuando estuviera disponible en algunos foros de fotografía) y varios tipos de calificaciones. Todos estos metadatos son generalmente descripciones precisas o anotaciones para el contenido de la imagen, que luego son indexadas por tecnologías de búsqueda basadas en texto general [9, 18, 11]. En el sistema actual, la función de clasificación fue ajustada específicamente para enfatizar la información de título, categorización y calificación. El tema 2 se aborda esencialmente en las siguientes secciones, las cuales determinan la calidad de las fotos mediante el análisis de las calificaciones proporcionadas por varios foros de fotos en la web. Aquí elegimos seis foros de fotos para estudiar el problema de clasificación y los denominamos como Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E y Web-F. 3.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones de Fotos Se analizan detalladamente diferentes métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en esta sección. En este análisis, las cámaras digitales zero 1 guardan archivos JPEG (.jpg) con datos EXIF (Exchangeable Image File). La configuración de la cámara y la información de la escena son registradas por la cámara en el archivo de imagen. www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 6: Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones medias normalizadas a [0, 10] que suelen ocupar aproximadamente el 30% del número total de fotos en algunos foros web no se tienen en cuenta actualmente. Cómo utilizar estas fotos queda para futuras exploraciones. En la Figura 6, enumeramos las distribuciones de la puntuación media, la cual está transformada a un intervalo fijo [0, 10]. Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones promedio de estos foros web lucen bastante diferentes. Las distribuciones en las Figuras 6(a), 6(b) y 6(e) parecen distribuciones gaussianas, mientras que las de las Figuras 6(d) y 6(f) están dominadas por la puntuación más alta. La razón de estas distribuciones excéntricas para Web-D y Web-F radica en sus sistemas de calificación groseros. De hecho, Web-D y Web-F utilizan escalas de valoración de 2 o 3 puntos, mientras que otros foros web utilizan escalas de valoración de 7 u 14 puntos. Por lo tanto, será problemático si usamos directamente estos puntajes promediados. Además, es muy probable que la puntuación promedio sea manipulada si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando una foto. La Figura 7 muestra el método de normalización de puntuación total por puntajes máximos y mínimos, que es uno de nuestros sistemas de referencia. Todos los puntajes totales de un foro web dado se normalizan a [0, 100] de acuerdo con el puntaje máximo y mínimo del foro web correspondiente. Observamos que la distribución total de puntuaciones de Web-A en la Figura 7(a) tiene dos colas más grandes que todas las demás. Para mostrar la forma de las distribuciones de manera más clara, solo mostramos las distribuciones en [0, 25] en la Figura 7(b), 7(c), 7(d), 7(e) y 7(f). La Figura 8 muestra el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%, donde los modos de las seis distribuciones se normalizan a 5 y el percentil 90% a 8. Podemos ver que este método de normalización hace que las distribuciones de las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. Los dos algoritmos propuestos se basan en estos métodos de normalización. 3.3 Detección de fotos duplicadas. Dirigido a la eficiencia computacional, el algoritmo Dedup puede perder cierta tasa de recuperación, pero lograr una alta tasa de precisión. También nos enfocamos en encontrar enlaces ocultos precisos en lugar de todos los enlaces ocultos. La Figura 9 muestra algunos ejemplos de detección de duplicados. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 y verifican que existen grandes cantidades de fotos duplicadas en cualquier par de foros web, incluso con la estricta condición para la Deduplicación donde elegimos los primeros 29 bits como el código hash. Dado que solo hay unos pocos parámetros para estimar en los métodos de fusión propuestos, los números de fotos duplicadas mostrados en la Tabla 1 son 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 7: Normalización Maxmin 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 8: Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90% suficiente para determinar estos parámetros. La última columna de la tabla lista el número total de fotos en los foros web correspondientes. 3.4 δ Medida Los parámetros de los algoritmos lineales y no lineales propuestos se calculan utilizando los datos duplicados mostrados en la Tabla 1, donde se elige Web-C como el foro web de referencia ya que comparte la mayoría de las fotos duplicadas con otros foros. Las tablas 2 y 3 muestran la medida δ en el modelo lineal y el modelo no lineal. Dado que δkl es simétrico y δkk = 0, solo mostramos la parte triangular superior. Los valores NaN en ambas tablas se encuentran en que no se han detectado fotos duplicadas por el algoritmo Dedup, como se informa en la Tabla 1. El modelo lineal garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la Tabla 1: Número de fotos duplicadas entre cada par de foros web A B C D E F Escala A 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k B 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675k C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D 178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155k E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448k F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122k 383 Figura 9: Algunos resultados de la detección de fotos duplicadas Tabla 2: Medida δ en el modelo lineal. La comunidad de referencia debería ser teóricamente no menor a 0. Es, de hecho, el caso (ver los números subrayados en la Tabla 2). Pero este modelo no puede garantizar que las medidas de δ en las comunidades no referenciales también sean iguales o superiores a 0, ya que los pasos de normalización se basan en fotos duplicadas entre la comunidad de referencia y una comunidad no referencial. Los resultados muestran que todos los números en la medida δ son mayores que 0 (ver todos los números no subrayados en la Tabla 2), lo cual indica que es probable que este modelo dé resultados óptimos. Por el contrario, el modelo no lineal no garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la comunidad de referencia deban ser no inferiores a 0, ya que no todas las fotos duplicadas entre los dos foros web pueden ser utilizadas al optimizar este modelo. De hecho, las fotos duplicadas que se encuentran en intervalos diferentes no serán utilizadas en este modelo. Son estas fotos duplicadas específicas las que hacen que la medida δ sea negativa. Como resultado, hay tanto elementos negativos como positivos en la Tabla 3, pero en general el número de positivos es mayor que el de negativos (9:5), lo que indica que el modelo puede ser mejor que el método de normalización únicamente (ver siguiente subsección) que tiene una medida δ completamente nula, y peor que el modelo lineal. 3.5 Estudio de Usuario Debido a que es difícil encontrar un criterio objetivo para evaluar la Tabla 3: medida δ en el modelo no lineal. Web-B Web-C Web-D Web-E Web-F Web-A 0.0559 0.0054 -0.0185 -0.0054 NaN Web-B - -0.0162 -0.0345 -0.0301 0.0466 Web-C - - 0.0136 0.0071 0.1264 Web-D - - - 0.0032 0.0143 Web-E - - - - 0.214 qué función de clasificación es mejor, optamos por realizar estudios de usuario para evaluaciones subjetivas. Diez sujetos fueron invitados a participar en el estudio de usuarios. Fueron reclutados de universidades cercanas. Dado que los motores de búsqueda de búsqueda de texto y búsqueda de imágenes son familiares para los estudiantes universitarios, no había un criterio previo para elegir a los estudiantes. Realizamos estudios de usuarios utilizando Internet Explorer 6.0 en Windows XP con monitores LCD de 17 pulgadas configurados en 1,280 píxeles por 1,024 píxeles en color de 32 bits. Los datos fueron registrados con registros del servidor y encuestas en papel después de cada tarea. Figura 10: Interfaz del estudio de usuario. Específicamente diseñamos una interfaz para el estudio de usuario como se muestra en la Figura 10. Para cada par de métodos de fusión, se alentó a los participantes a probar cualquier consulta que desearan. Para aquellos sin ideas específicas, se enumeraron dos cuadros combinados (lista de categorías y lista de consultas) en el panel inferior, donde se proporcionaron las 1,000 consultas de búsqueda de imágenes principales de un motor de búsqueda comercial. Después de que un participante envió una consulta, el sistema seleccionó aleatoriamente el marco izquierdo o derecho para mostrar cada uno de los dos resultados de clasificación. Los participantes debían luego juzgar cuál de los dos resultados de clasificación era mejor, o si los dos resultados de clasificación tenían la misma calidad, y enviar el juicio eligiendo el botón de radio correspondiente y haciendo clic en el botón de enviar. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 10, se envía la consulta \"sunset\" al sistema. Entonces, 79,092 fotos fueron devueltas y clasificadas por el método de fusión Minmax en el marco izquierdo y el método de fusión lineal en el marco derecho. Un participante luego compara los dos resultados de clasificación (sin conocer los métodos de clasificación) y envía sus comentarios eligiendo respuestas en la opción Tuya. Tabla 4: Resultados del estudio de usuario Norm. Solo Manual Lineal Lineal 29:13:10 14:22:15 No lineal 29:15:9 12:27:12 6:4:45 La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados experimentales, donde Lineal denota el método de fusión lineal, No lineal denota el método de fusión no lineal, Norm. Solo significa el método de normalización Maxmin, Manualmente significa el método ajustado manualmente. Los tres números en cada ítem, por ejemplo 29:13:10, significan que 29 juicios prefieren los resultados de fusión lineal, 10 384 juicios prefieren el método de normalización solamente, y 13 juicios consideran que estos dos métodos son equivalentes. Realizamos el análisis de ANOVA y obtenemos las siguientes conclusiones: 1. Tanto los métodos lineales como no lineales son significativamente mejores que la Norma. El único método con valores P respectivos de 0.00165 (< 0.05) y 0.00073 (<< 0.05). Este resultado es consistente con el resultado de la evaluación de la medida δ. La norma. El único método asume que las 10% mejores fotos en diferentes foros tienen la misma calidad. Sin embargo, esta suposición no se sostiene en general. Por ejemplo, una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de primer nivel generalmente tiene una calidad superior a una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de segundo nivel. Esto es similar a eso, los estudiantes del 10% superior en una universidad de primer nivel y los de una universidad de segundo nivel suelen ser de diferente calidad. Tanto los métodos de fusión lineal como no lineal reconocen la existencia de tales diferencias y buscan cuantificarlas. Por lo tanto, ellos se desempeñan mejor que la norma. Único método. 2. El método de fusión lineal es significativamente mejor que el no lineal con un valor P de 1.195 × 10−10. Este resultado es bastante sorprendente ya que se espera que este método de clasificación más complicado ajuste la clasificación de manera más precisa que el lineal. La razón principal de este resultado puede ser que es difícil encontrar los mejores intervalos donde se debe llevar a cabo el ajuste no lineal y, sin embargo, simplemente se eligió la parte central del método de Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90%. Los métodos de evaluación que consumen mucho tiempo y son subjetivos - estudios de usuario - nos impidieron ajustar extensamente estos parámetros. 3. Los métodos lineales y no lineales propuestos tienen un rendimiento casi igual o ligeramente mejor que el método ajustado manualmente. Dado que los métodos de fusión lineal/no lineal son enfoques completamente automáticos, se consideran soluciones prácticas y eficientes cuando se necesite integrar más comunidades (por ejemplo, docenas de comunidades). 4. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJO FUTURO En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web en los casos de falta de relaciones entre objetos donde los algoritmos de clasificación tradicionales ya no son válidos, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. Hemos construido un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical de alta calidad y propuesto métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas fuentes de datos (foros web) como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por el algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son una solución práctica y eficiente para la clasificación de objetos web en las relaciones mencionadas. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros tipos de objetos web, incluyendo videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, música, dibujos, esculturas, y así sucesivamente. El sistema actual está lejos de ser perfecto. Para hacer este sistema más efectivo, se necesitan análisis más delicados para el dominio vertical (por ejemplo, foros de fotos en la web). Los siguientes puntos, por ejemplo, pueden mejorar los resultados de búsqueda y serán nuestro trabajo futuro: 1. un análisis más sutil y luego la utilización de diferentes tipos de calificaciones (por ejemplo, calificaciones de novedad, calificaciones estéticas); 2. diferenciar diversas comunidades que pueden tener diferentes intereses y preferencias o incluso entendimientos culturales distintos; 3. incorporar más información útil, incluida la información de fotógrafos y revisores, para modelar las fotos en un espacio de datos heterogéneo en lugar del actual homogéneo. Utilizaremos aún más el filtrado colaborativo para recomendar fotos relevantes de alta calidad a los navegadores. Un problema abierto es si podemos encontrar un criterio objetivo y eficiente para evaluar los resultados de clasificación, en lugar de emplear estudios de usuario subjetivos e ineficientes, que nos impidieron probar más algoritmos de clasificación y ajustar parámetros en un algoritmo.

        "49, Zhichun Road Haidian District, Beijing, 100080, P R China ABSTRACT Vertical search is a promising direction as it leverages domainspecific knowledge and can provide more precise information for users.",
        "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.",
        "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
        "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
        "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
        "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
        "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval; G.2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory; H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services - Web-based services General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
        "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
        "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
        "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
        "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
        "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
        "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
        "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
        "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
        "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
        "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
        "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
        "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
        "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
        "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
        "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
        "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
        "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
        "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
        "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
        "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
        "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
        "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
        "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
        "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
        "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
        "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
        "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
        "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
        "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
        "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
        "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
        "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
        "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
        "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
        "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
        "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
        "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
        "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
        "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
        "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
        "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
        "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
        "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
        "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
        "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
        "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
        "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
        "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
        "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
        "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
        "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
        "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
        "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
        "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
        "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
        "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
        "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
        "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
        "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
        "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
        "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
        "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
        "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
        "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
        "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
        "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
        "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
        "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
        "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
        "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
        "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
        "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
        "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
        "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
        "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
        "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
        "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
        "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
        "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
        "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
        "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
        "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
        "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
        "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
        "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
        "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
        "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
        "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
        "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
        "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
        "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
        "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
        "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
        "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
        "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
        "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
        "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
        "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
        "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
        "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
        "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
        "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
        "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
        "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
        "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
        "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
        "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
        "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
        "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
        "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
        "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
        "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
        "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
        "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
        "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
        "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
        "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
        "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
        "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
        "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
        "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
        "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
        "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
        "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
        "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
        "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
        "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
        "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
        "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
        "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
        "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
        "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",

        "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
        "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
        "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
        "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
        "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
        "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
        "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
        "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
        "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
        "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
        "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
        "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
        "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
        "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
        "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
        "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
        "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
        "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
        "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
        "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
        "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
        "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on high-quality photo search.",
        "We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1.",
        "Then we focus on how to rank photos from different Web forums.",
        "In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2.",
        "Then we try to find duplicate photos in section 3.3.",
        "Some intermediate results are discussed using δ measure in section 3.4.",
        "Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable.",
        "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",
        "As for Issue 3, we devise the interface of the system deliberately in order to smooth the users process of enjoying high-quality photos.",
        "Techniques, such as Fisheye and slides show, are utilized in current system.",
        "Figure 5 shows the interface.",
        "We will not talk more about this issue as it is not an emphasis of this paper.",
        "Figure 5: EnjoyPhoto: an enjoyable high-quality photo search engine, where 26,477 records are returned for the query fall in about 0.421 seconds As for Issue 1, we extracted from a commercial search engine a subset of photos coming from various photo forums all over the world, and explicitly parsed the Web pages containing these photos.",
        "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
        "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",
        "All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11].",
        "In current system, the ranking function was specifically tuned to emphasize title, categorization, and rating information.",
        "Issue 2 is essentially dealt with in the following sections which derive the quality of photos by analyzing ratings provided by various Web photo forums.",
        "Here we chose six photo forums to study the ranking problem and denote them as Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E and Web-F. 3.2 Photo Score Normalization Detailed analysis of different score normalization methods are analyzed in this section.",
        "In this analysis, the zero 1 Digital cameras save JPEG (.jpg) files with EXIF (Exchangeable Image File) data.",

        "How to utilize these photos is left for future explorations.",
        "In Figure 6, we list the distributions of the mean score, which is transformed to a fixed interval [0, 10].",
        "The distributions of the average scores of these Web forums look quite different.",
        "Distributions in Figure 6(a), 6(b), and 6(e) looks like Gaussian distributions, while those in Figure 6(d) and 6(f) are dominated by the top score.",
        "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
        "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",
        "Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores.",
        "Furthermore the average score is very likely to be spammed, if there are only a few users rating a photo.",
        "Figure 7 shows the total score normalization method by maximal and minimal scores, which is one of our base line system.",
        "All the total scores of a given Web forum are normalized to [0, 100] according to the maximal score and minimal score of corresponding Web forum.",
        "We notice that total score distribution of Web-A in Figure 7(a) has two larger tails than all the others.",
        "To show the shape of the distributions more clearly, we only show the distributions on [0, 25] in Figure 7(b),7(c),7(d),7(e), and 7(f).",
        "Figure 8 shows the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method, where the modes of the six distributions are normalized to 5 and the 90% percentile to 8.",
        "We can see that this normalization method makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
        "The two proposed algorithms are all based on these normalization methods. 3.3 Duplicate photo detection Targeting at computational efficiency, the Dedup algorithm may lose some recall rate, but can achieve a high precision rate.",

        "Both the intermediate results and the user studies show that the proposed fusion methods are a practical and efficient solution to Web object ranking in the aforesaid relationships.",
        "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other kinds of Web objects including video clips, poems, short stories, music, drawings, sculptures, and so on.",
        "Current system is far from being perfect.",
        "In order to make this system more effective, more delicate analysis for the vertical domain (e.g., Web photo forums) are needed.",
        "The following points, for example, may improve the searching results and will be our future work: 1. more subtle analysis and then utilization of different kinds of ratings (e.g., novelty ratings, aesthetic ratings); 2. differentiating various communities who may have different interests and preferences or even distinct culture understandings; 3. incorporating more useful information, including photographers and reviewers information, to model the photos in a heterogeneous data space instead of the current homogeneous one.",
        "We will further utilize collaborative filtering to recommend relevant high-quality photos to browsers.",
        "One open problem is whether we can find an objective and efficient criterion for evaluating the ranking results, instead of employing subjective and inefficient user studies, which blocked us from trying more ranking algorithms and tuning parameters in one algorithm. 5.",

        "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo,",
        "Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3].",
        "Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo.",
        "Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes.",
        "Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades.",
        "Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva.",
        "Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos.",

        "Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva.",

        "Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de objetos web en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación.",
        "En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes.",
        "Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24].",
        "Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general.",
        "Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes.",
        "Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial.",
        "El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria.",
        "Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos.",
        "Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad.",
        "Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad.",
        "Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad.",
        "Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen.",
        "Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato.",
        "Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad.",
        "Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor.",
        "En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales.",
        "Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos.",
        "Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes.",
        "Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos.",
        "La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos.",
        "Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos.",
        "En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web.",
        "De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro.",
        "Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar.",
        "Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía.",
        "Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros.",
        "Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización.",
        "Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1.",
        "Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales.",
        "Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente.",
        "El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera.",
        "En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas.",
        "En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo.",
        "Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4.",
        "Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2.",
        "ALGORITMO 2.1 Resumen La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web radica en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente existen dos tipos de libertad.",
        "El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web.",
        "Por ejemplo, algunos foros utilizan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros utilizan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o de 10 puntos.",
        "Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero un análisis detallado de los datos y experimentos muestra que es un problema no trivial.",
        "El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web.",
        "Es decir, la misma puntuación no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros.",
        "De manera intuitiva, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos establecer relaciones entre cualquier par de foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante la normalización y transformación de puntuaciones.",
        "Afortunadamente, descubrimos que existe un buen número de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos en la web.",
        "Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de obtener una amplia difusión.",
        "En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente de detección de fotos duplicadas [10] para encontrar estas fotos.",
        "Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones.",
        "Ante la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se requiere un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable.",
        "Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como el foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo).",
        "Idealmente, las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas deberían ser iguales aunque estén en diferentes foros.",
        "Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes foros, excepto en el foro de referencia, pueden variar en un espacio paramétrico.",
        "Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntuación.",
        "Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer que las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas en foros no de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible a las del foro de referencia, podemos resolver eficazmente el problema de clasificación.",
        "Para mayor comodidad, se emplean las siguientes notaciones.",
        "Ski y ¯Ski denotan la puntuación total y la puntuación media del i-ésimo objeto web (foto) en el k-ésimo sitio web, respectivamente.",
        "La puntuación total se refiere a la suma de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación (por ejemplo, la puntuación de novedad y la puntuación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación.",
        "Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web.",
        "Además, utilizamos {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} para denotar el conjunto de puntuaciones de objetos web (fotos) en los foros web k-ésimos que son duplicados con los foros web l-ésimos, donde Ikl es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web.",
        "En general, la fusión de puntuaciones se puede ver como el procedimiento de encontrar K transformaciones ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K de manera que eSki se pueda utilizar para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web.",
        "La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web.",
        "Cada comunidad web forma un subgrafo, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas). El párrafo puede formularse como min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 como el foro de referencia y por lo tanto ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que puede establecerse heurísticamente según el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro no de referencia.",
        "Cuanto más revisores haya, más popular será la foto y mayor debería ser el peso correspondiente ¯wk i.",
        "En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk i y simplemente los establecemos en uno.",
        "Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk i, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados.",
        "La Figura 1 ilustra la idea mencionada anteriormente.",
        "La Comunidad Web 1 es la comunidad de referencia.",
        "Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web enlazados son en realidad el mismo.",
        "El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., K), el cual tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo a ciertos modelos.",
        "Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la Ecuación 1, se realiza la suma en todas las líneas punteadas rojas.",
        "Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en la Sección 2.2, que servirá como base para el trabajo siguiente.",
        "Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método ajustado manualmente en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso impráctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande.",
        "En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar de manera precisa fotos duplicadas entre foros web.",
        "Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: Fusión lineal y Fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5.",
        "Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algunos otros trabajos relacionados. 2.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones Dado que los diferentes foros web (de fotos) en la web suelen tener diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión.",
        "Además, dado que existen muchos tipos de calificaciones, como calificaciones para novedad, calificaciones para estética, etc., es razonable elegir una común, como la puntuación total o la puntuación promedio, que siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calcular a partir de las calificaciones correspondientes.",
        "Esto permite que el método de normalización en la puntuación total o puntuación promedio sea visto como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web.",
        "Es sencillo normalizar las puntuaciones promedio mediante su transformación lineal a un intervalo fijo.",
        "Llamamos a este tipo de puntuación como Puntuación Media Escalada.",
        "La dificultad, sin embargo, de utilizar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que la puntuación promedio para el objeto sea manipulada o sesgada.",
        "La puntuación total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como la calidad y popularidad de los objetos web.",
        "El problema radica en cómo normalizar las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros web.",
        "La forma más sencilla puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas.",
        "La desventaja de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos.",
        "Para hacer que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%.",
        "Aquí, la puntuación modal representa la puntuación total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total.",
        "Y El puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de las imágenes tiene un puntaje total más bajo.",
        "Este método de normalización utiliza la moda y el percentil 90 como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes.",
        "La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo en diferentes foros de fotografía, es que aunque las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar considerablemente y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad intermedia (desde la moda hasta el percentil 90) debería ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (rigurosidad) de los foros web.",
        "Las fotos de este nivel intermedio en un foro web suelen ocupar más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro.",
        "Daremos un análisis más detallado de las puntuaciones en la Sección 3.2. 2.3 Fusión Manual El foro de películas en la web, IMDB [16], propuso utilizar una función de clasificación bayesiana para normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación dentro de una comunidad.",
        "Motivados por esta función de clasificación, proponemos este método de fusión manual: Para el k-ésimo sitio web, utilizamos la siguiente fórmula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) para clasificar fotos, donde nk es el número de votos y n∗ k, S∗ k y αk son tres parámetros.",
        "Esta función de clasificación primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuación media original ¯Ski y una puntuación de referencia S∗ k para obtener una puntuación media ponderada que puede ser más confiable que ¯Ski.",
        "Entonces, la puntuación media ponderada se escala por αk para obtener la puntuación final fSki.",
        "Para n comunidades web, hay aproximadamente 3n parámetros en {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} para ajustar.",
        "Aunque este método puede lograr resultados bastante buenos después de ajustes manuales cuidadosos y exhaustivos en estos parámetros, cuando n se vuelve cada vez más grande, por ejemplo, si hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web rastreadas e indexadas, este método se volverá cada vez más laborioso y eventualmente se volverá impracticable.",
        "Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un método de fusión efectivo cuyos parámetros puedan determinarse automáticamente. 2.4 Detección de Fotos Duplicadas Utilizamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo eficiente y efectivo de detección de imágenes duplicadas, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre cualquier par de foros de fotos.",
        "Este algoritmo utiliza una función hash para mapear una característica de alta dimensión a un código hash de 32 bits (ver abajo para cómo construir el código hash).",
        "La complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imágenes duplicadas entre n imágenes es aproximadamente O(n log n).",
        "La característica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrículas regulares de k × k.",
        "Basándose en todas las características extraídas de la base de datos de imágenes, se construye un modelo de PCA.",
        "Las características visuales son luego transformadas a un espacio PCA de baja dimensionalidad y media cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema.",
        "Entonces, el código hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensión se transforma en uno si el valor en esta dimensión es mayor que 0, y en 0 en caso contrario.",
        "Las fotos en el mismo grupo se consideran posibles duplicados y se filtran aún más por un umbral en términos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de características visuales.",
        "La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde se extraen características visuales - valores de gris promedio - en cuadrículas de 6 × 6 y 7 × 7.",
        "Las características de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el código hash se genera de acuerdo a los signos.",
        "Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la detección de fotos duplicadas. 2.5 Fusión de Puntuaciones En esta sección, presentaremos dos soluciones sobre la fusión de puntuaciones basadas en diferentes suposiciones de forma paramétrica de ψk en la Ecuación 1. 2.5.1 Fusión Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas. Intuitivamente, la forma más directa de eliminar las incertidumbres causadas por los diferentes criterios es escalar, relativo a un centro dado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foto de foro web no referenciada con respecto al foro de referencia.",
        "Más estrictamente, asumimos que ψk tiene la siguiente forma ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones del foro k(= 1) deben escalarse por αk en relación al centro tk 1−αk, como se muestra en la Figura 3.",
        "Entonces, si sustituimos ψk anterior en la Ec. 1, obtenemos la siguiente función objetivo, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K donde f es la función objetivo definida en la Ec. 5, obtenemos la solución en forma cerrada como: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) donde Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un método de fusión lineal.",
        "Disfruta de la simplicidad y el excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos.",
        "Figura 3: Método de Fusión Lineal 2.5.2 Fusión No Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas A veces queremos un método que pueda ajustar puntuaciones en intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios.",
        "Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el método puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] dejando las puntuaciones C0 y C1 sin cambios.",
        "Este tipo de método de fusión es mucho más refinado que los lineales y contiene muchos más parámetros para ajustar y se espera que mejore aún más los resultados.",
        "Aquí proponemos una solución de fusión no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones.",
        "Primero, introducimos una transformación: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, si x ∈ (c0, c1] x en otro caso donde α > 0.",
        "Esta transformación satisface que para x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] con ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 y ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
        "Luego podemos utilizar esta transformación no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figura 4: Método de fusión no lineal.",
        "Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento.",
        "Aunque no hay una solución en forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimización, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2, no es difícil obtener la solución numérica.",
        "Bajo las mismas suposiciones hechas en la Sección 2.2, podemos utilizar este método para ajustar las puntuaciones de nivel intermedio (desde el punto de la moda hasta el percentil 90).",
        "Se espera que este método de fusión no lineal más complicado logre mejores resultados que el lineal.",
        "Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parámetros de manera exhaustiva.",
        "Los experimentos actuales en la Sección 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple. 2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de fusión Dado que nuestra función objetivo es hacer que las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro no referencial y el foro de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible, es natural investigar qué tan cerca llegan a estar entre sí y cómo cambian las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web entre los dos foros no referenciales antes y después de la fusión de puntuaciones.",
        "Tomando la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la Comunidad Web 1) y un foro no de referencia, lo que corresponde a minimizar la función objetivo en los enlaces rojos discontinuos (ocultos).",
        "Después de la optimización, debemos preguntarnos qué sucede con las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros no de referencia.",
        "O, en otras palabras, ¿se vuelven más consistentes las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces verdes discontinuos (ocultos)?",
        "Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de rendimiento δ para cuantificar los cambios en las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web como δkl = Sim(Slk, Skl) - Sim(Slk ∗, Skl ∗) (10) donde Skl = (Skl 1, ..., Skl Ikl)T, Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1, ..., eSkl Ikl)T y Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b||. δkl > 0 significa que después de la fusión de puntuaciones, las puntuaciones en los mismos objetos web entre el k-ésimo y el l-ésimo foro web se vuelven más consistentes, lo cual es lo que esperamos.",
        "Por el contrario, si δkl < 0, esas puntuaciones se vuelven más inconsistentes.",
        "Aunque no podemos depender de esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusión, ya que clasificar fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificación intermedios y proporcionar información sobre el rendimiento final de diferentes métodos de clasificación. 2.6 Contrastes con Otros Trabajos Relacionados Ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los métodos propuestos con los métodos tradicionales, como PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y los algoritmos de LinkFusion [27] en la Sección 1.",
        "Aquí discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas.",
        "El problema actual también puede ser visto como un problema de agregación de rangos [13, 14] ya que tratamos con la cuestión de cómo combinar varias listas de rangos.",
        "Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos.",
        "En primer lugar, a diferencia de las páginas web, que pueden ser detectadas fácil y precisamente como las mismas páginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados con cierta precisión y recuperación.",
        "Segundo, los números de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeños en comparación con el total de conjuntos de fotos (ver Tabla 1).",
        "En otras palabras, las listas de clasificación de los K mejores de diferentes foros web son casi disjuntas para una consulta dada.",
        "Bajo esta condición, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como sus medidas - distancia de Kendall tau o distancia de la regla de Spearman - degenerarán en algunos casos triviales.",
        "Otra categoría de métodos de fusión de rangos (agregación) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automático, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12].",
        "Todos estos métodos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo.",
        "En la configuración actual, es difícil o incluso imposible etiquetar estos conjuntos de datos según su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para clasificar.",
        "En cambio, el problema aquí es cómo combinar varias sub listas ordenadas para formar una lista de orden total. 3.",
        "EXPERIMENTOS En esta sección, llevamos a cabo nuestra investigación sobre la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad.",

        "Para una consulta de texto dada, este sistema clasifica las fotos basándose en una cierta combinación de la relevancia de la foto para esta consulta (Problema 1) y la calidad de la foto (Problema 2), y finalmente las muestra de una manera agradable (Problema 3).",

En cuanto al tema 1, extraímos de un motor de búsqueda comercial un subconjunto de fotos procedentes de varios foros de fotos de todo el mundo, y analizamos explícitamente las páginas web que contienen estas fotos.",
        "El número de fotos en la colección de datos es de aproximadamente 2.5 millones.",
        "Después del análisis, cada foto se asoció con su título, categoría, descripción, configuración de la cámara, datos EXIF 1 (cuando estuvieran disponibles para imágenes digitales), ubicación (cuando estuviera disponible en algunos foros de fotografía) y varios tipos de calificaciones.",
        "Todos estos metadatos son generalmente descripciones precisas o anotaciones para el contenido de la imagen, que luego son indexadas por tecnologías de búsqueda basadas en texto general [9, 18, 11].",

        "La razón de estas distribuciones excéntricas para Web-D y Web-F radica en sus sistemas de calificación groseros.",
        "De hecho, Web-D y Web-F utilizan escalas de valoración de 2 o 3 puntos, mientras que otros foros web utilizan escalas de valoración de 7 u 14 puntos.",
        "Por lo tanto, será problemático si usamos directamente estos puntajes promediados.",
        "Además, es muy probable que la puntuación promedio sea manipulada si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando una foto.",

        "Todos los puntajes totales de un foro web dado se normalizan a [0, 100] de acuerdo con el puntaje máximo y mínimo del foro web correspondiente.",
        "Observamos que la distribución total de puntuaciones de Web-A en la Figura 7(a) tiene dos colas más grandes que todas las demás.",

        "Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros tipos de objetos web, incluyendo videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, música, dibujos, esculturas, y así sucesivamente.",
        "El sistema actual está lejos de ser perfecto.",
        "Para hacer este sistema más efectivo, se necesitan análisis más delicados para el dominio vertical (por ejemplo, foros de fotos en la web).",
        "Los siguientes puntos, por ejemplo, pueden mejorar los resultados de búsqueda y serán nuestro trabajo futuro: 1. un análisis más sutil y luego la utilización de diferentes tipos de calificaciones (por ejemplo, calificaciones de novedad, calificaciones estéticas); 2. diferenciar diversas comunidades que pueden tener diferentes intereses y preferencias o incluso entendimientos culturales distintos; 3. incorporar más información útil, incluida la información de fotógrafos y revisores, para modelar las fotos en un espacio de datos heterogéneo en lugar del actual homogéneo.",
        "Utilizaremos aún más el filtrado colaborativo para recomendar fotos relevantes de alta calidad a los navegadores.",
        "Un problema abierto es si podemos encontrar un criterio objetivo y eficiente para evaluar los resultados de clasificación, en lugar de emplear estudios de usuario subjetivos e ineficientes, que nos impidieron probar más algoritmos de clasificación y ajustar parámetros en un algoritmo.",

                "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a <br>vertical search</br> engine.",
                "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",

                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, <br>vertical search</br> has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many <br>vertical search</br> engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the <br>vertical search</br> engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building <br>vertical search</br> engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building <br>vertical search</br> engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
                "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",

                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2.",
                "Then we try to find duplicate photos in section 3.3.",
                "Some intermediate results are discussed using δ measure in section 3.4.",
                "Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable.",
                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

                "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
                "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",
                "All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11].",
                "In current system, the ranking function was specifically tuned to emphasize title, categorization, and rating information.",

                "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
                "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",
                "Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores.",

Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito.

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",

                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",

                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1.",

                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of <br>web object-ranking</br> algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",

                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",

                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",

                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",

                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",

                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K.

                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",

                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de <br>clasificación de objetos web</br>, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música.

A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de <br>clasificación de objetos web</br> en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de <br>clasificación de objetos web</br> para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2. ALGORITMO 2.1 Resumen La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web radica en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente existen dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros utilizan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros utilizan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o de 10 puntos. Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero un análisis detallado de los datos y experimentos muestra que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, la misma puntuación no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. De manera intuitiva, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos establecer relaciones entre cualquier par de foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante la normalización y transformación de puntuaciones. Afortunadamente, descubrimos que existe un buen número de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos en la web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de obtener una amplia difusión. En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente de detección de fotos duplicadas [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Ante la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se requiere un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como el foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas deberían ser iguales aunque estén en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes foros, excepto en el foro de referencia, pueden variar en un espacio paramétrico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntuación. Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer que las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas en foros no de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible a las del foro de referencia, podemos resolver eficazmente el problema de clasificación. Para mayor comodidad, se emplean las siguientes notaciones. Ski y ¯Ski denotan la puntuación total y la puntuación media del i-ésimo objeto web (foto) en el k-ésimo sitio web, respectivamente. La puntuación total se refiere a la suma de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación (por ejemplo, la puntuación de novedad y la puntuación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Además, utilizamos {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} para denotar el conjunto de puntuaciones de objetos web (fotos) en los foros web k-ésimos que son duplicados con los foros web l-ésimos, donde Ikl es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusión de puntuaciones se puede ver como el procedimiento de encontrar K transformaciones ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K de manera que eSki se pueda utilizar para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma un subgrafo, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas). El párrafo puede formularse como min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 como el foro de referencia y por lo tanto ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que puede establecerse heurísticamente según el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro no de referencia. Cuanto más revisores haya, más popular será la foto y mayor debería ser el peso correspondiente ¯wk i. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk i y simplemente los establecemos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk i, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea mencionada anteriormente. La Comunidad Web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web enlazados son en realidad el mismo. El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., K), el cual tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo a ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la Ecuación 1, se realiza la suma en todas las líneas punteadas rojas. Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en la Sección 2.2, que servirá como base para el trabajo siguiente. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método ajustado manualmente en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso impráctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar de manera precisa fotos duplicadas entre foros web. Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: Fusión lineal y Fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5. Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algunos otros trabajos relacionados. 2.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones Dado que los diferentes foros web (de fotos) en la web suelen tener diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión. Además, dado que existen muchos tipos de calificaciones, como calificaciones para novedad, calificaciones para estética, etc., es razonable elegir una común, como la puntuación total o la puntuación promedio, que siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calcular a partir de las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el método de normalización en la puntuación total o puntuación promedio sea visto como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar las puntuaciones promedio mediante su transformación lineal a un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntuación como Puntuación Media Escalada. La dificultad, sin embargo, de utilizar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que la puntuación promedio para el objeto sea manipulada o sesgada. La puntuación total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como la calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema radica en cómo normalizar las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros web. La forma más sencilla puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas. La desventaja de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos. Para hacer que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%. Aquí, la puntuación modal representa la puntuación total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total. Y El puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de las imágenes tiene un puntaje total más bajo. Este método de normalización utiliza la moda y el percentil 90 como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo en diferentes foros de fotografía, es que aunque las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar considerablemente y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad intermedia (desde la moda hasta el percentil 90) debería ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (rigurosidad) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel intermedio en un foro web suelen ocupar más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un análisis más detallado de las puntuaciones en la Sección 3.2. 2.3 Fusión Manual El foro de películas en la web, IMDB [16], propuso utilizar una función de clasificación bayesiana para normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación dentro de una comunidad. Motivados por esta función de clasificación, proponemos este método de fusión manual: Para el k-ésimo sitio web, utilizamos la siguiente fórmula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) para clasificar fotos, donde nk es el número de votos y n∗ k, S∗ k y αk son tres parámetros. Esta función de clasificación primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuación media original ¯Ski y una puntuación de referencia S∗ k para obtener una puntuación media ponderada que puede ser más confiable que ¯Ski. Entonces, la puntuación media ponderada se escala por αk para obtener la puntuación final fSki. Para n comunidades web, hay aproximadamente 3n parámetros en {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} para ajustar. Aunque este método puede lograr resultados bastante buenos después de ajustes manuales cuidadosos y exhaustivos en estos parámetros, cuando n se vuelve cada vez más grande, por ejemplo, si hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web rastreadas e indexadas, este método se volverá cada vez más laborioso y eventualmente se volverá impracticable. Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un método de fusión efectivo cuyos parámetros puedan determinarse automáticamente. 2.4 Detección de Fotos Duplicadas Utilizamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo eficiente y efectivo de detección de imágenes duplicadas, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre cualquier par de foros de fotos. Este algoritmo utiliza una función hash para mapear una característica de alta dimensión a un código hash de 32 bits (ver abajo para cómo construir el código hash). La complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imágenes duplicadas entre n imágenes es aproximadamente O(n log n). La característica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrículas regulares de k × k. Basándose en todas las características extraídas de la base de datos de imágenes, se construye un modelo de PCA. Las características visuales son luego transformadas a un espacio PCA de baja dimensionalidad y media cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema. Entonces, el código hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensión se transforma en uno si el valor en esta dimensión es mayor que 0, y en 0 en caso contrario. Las fotos en el mismo grupo se consideran posibles duplicados y se filtran aún más por un umbral en términos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de características visuales. La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde se extraen características visuales - valores de gris promedio - en cuadrículas de 6 × 6 y 7 × 7. Las características de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el código hash se genera de acuerdo a los signos. Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la detección de fotos duplicadas. 2.5 Fusión de Puntuaciones En esta sección, presentaremos dos soluciones sobre la fusión de puntuaciones basadas en diferentes suposiciones de forma paramétrica de ψk en la Ecuación 1. 2.5.1 Fusión Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas. Intuitivamente, la forma más directa de eliminar las incertidumbres causadas por los diferentes criterios es escalar, relativo a un centro dado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foto de foro web no referenciada con respecto al foro de referencia. Más estrictamente, asumimos que ψk tiene la siguiente forma ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones del foro k(= 1) deben escalarse por αk en relación al centro tk 1−αk, como se muestra en la Figura 3. Entonces, si sustituimos ψk anterior en la Ec. 1, obtenemos la siguiente función objetivo, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K donde f es la función objetivo definida en la Ec. 5, obtenemos la solución en forma cerrada como: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) donde Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un método de fusión lineal. Disfruta de la simplicidad y el excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos. Figura 3: Método de Fusión Lineal 2.5.2 Fusión No Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas A veces queremos un método que pueda ajustar puntuaciones en intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios. Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el método puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] dejando las puntuaciones C0 y C1 sin cambios. Este tipo de método de fusión es mucho más refinado que los lineales y contiene muchos más parámetros para ajustar y se espera que mejore aún más los resultados. Aquí proponemos una solución de fusión no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones. Primero, introducimos una transformación: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, si x ∈ (c0, c1] x en otro caso donde α > 0. Esta transformación satisface que para x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] con ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 y ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1. Luego podemos utilizar esta transformación no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figura 4: Método de fusión no lineal. Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento. Aunque no hay una solución en forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimización, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2, no es difícil obtener la solución numérica. Bajo las mismas suposiciones hechas en la Sección 2.2, podemos utilizar este método para ajustar las puntuaciones de nivel intermedio (desde el punto de la moda hasta el percentil 90). Se espera que este método de fusión no lineal más complicado logre mejores resultados que el lineal. Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parámetros de manera exhaustiva. Los experimentos actuales en la Sección 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple. 2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de fusión Dado que nuestra función objetivo es hacer que las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro no referencial y el foro de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible, es natural investigar qué tan cerca llegan a estar entre sí y cómo cambian las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web entre los dos foros no referenciales antes y después de la fusión de puntuaciones. Tomando la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la Comunidad Web 1) y un foro no de referencia, lo que corresponde a minimizar la función objetivo en los enlaces rojos discontinuos (ocultos). Después de la optimización, debemos preguntarnos qué sucede con las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros no de referencia. O, en otras palabras, ¿se vuelven más consistentes las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces verdes discontinuos (ocultos)? Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de rendimiento δ para cuantificar los cambios en las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web como δkl = Sim(Slk, Skl) - Sim(Slk ∗, Skl ∗) (10) donde Skl = (Skl 1, ..., Skl Ikl)T, Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1, ..., eSkl Ikl)T y Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b||. δkl > 0 significa que después de la fusión de puntuaciones, las puntuaciones en los mismos objetos web entre el k-ésimo y el l-ésimo foro web se vuelven más consistentes, lo cual es lo que esperamos. Por el contrario, si δkl < 0, esas puntuaciones se vuelven más inconsistentes. Aunque no podemos depender de esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusión, ya que clasificar fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificación intermedios y proporcionar información sobre el rendimiento final de diferentes métodos de clasificación. 2.6 Contrastes con Otros Trabajos Relacionados Ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los métodos propuestos con los métodos tradicionales, como PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y los algoritmos de LinkFusion [27] en la Sección 1. Aquí discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas. El problema actual también puede ser visto como un problema de agregación de rangos [13, 14] ya que tratamos con la cuestión de cómo combinar varias listas de rangos. Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos. En primer lugar, a diferencia de las páginas web, que pueden ser detectadas fácil y precisamente como las mismas páginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados con cierta precisión y recuperación. Segundo, los números de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeños en comparación con el total de conjuntos de fotos (ver Tabla 1). En otras palabras, las listas de clasificación de los K mejores de diferentes foros web son casi disjuntas para una consulta dada. Bajo esta condición, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como sus medidas - distancia de Kendall tau o distancia de la regla de Spearman - degenerarán en algunos casos triviales. Otra categoría de métodos de fusión de rangos (agregación) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automático, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12]. Todos estos métodos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo. En la configuración actual, es difícil o incluso imposible etiquetar estos conjuntos de datos según su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para clasificar. En cambio, el problema aquí es cómo combinar varias sub listas ordenadas para formar una lista de orden total. 3. EXPERIMENTOS En esta sección, llevamos a cabo nuestra investigación sobre la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. Primero presentamos brevemente el nuevo motor de búsqueda de imágenes verticales propuesto - EnjoyPhoto en la sección 3.1. Luego nos enfocamos en cómo clasificar fotos de diferentes foros web. Para hacerlo, primero normalizamos las puntuaciones (calificaciones) de las fotos de diferentes foros web múltiples en la sección 3.2. Luego intentamos encontrar fotos duplicadas en la sección 3.3. Algunos resultados intermedios se discuten utilizando la medida δ en la sección 3.4. Finalmente se lleva a cabo un conjunto de estudios de usuarios cuidadosamente para justificar nuestro método propuesto en la sección 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: Motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad Para cumplir con el requisito de los usuarios de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, proponemos y construimos un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad - EnjoyPhoto, que aborda los siguientes tres problemas clave: 1. cómo rastrear e indexar fotos, 2. cómo determinar las cualidades de cada foto y 3. cómo mostrar los resultados de búsqueda para hacer que el proceso de búsqueda sea agradable. Para una consulta de texto dada, este sistema clasifica las fotos basándose en una cierta combinación de la relevancia de la foto para esta consulta (Problema 1) y la calidad de la foto (Problema 2), y finalmente las muestra de una manera agradable (Problema 3). En cuanto al tema 3, diseñamos la interfaz del sistema deliberadamente para facilitar el proceso de los usuarios al disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Técnicas como Fisheye y presentación de diapositivas son utilizadas en el sistema actual. La Figura 5 muestra la interfaz. No hablaremos más sobre este tema ya que no es un énfasis de este documento. Figura 5: EnjoyPhoto: un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad y agradable, donde se devuelven 26,477 registros para la consulta de otoño en aproximadamente 0.421 segundos. En cuanto al tema 1, extraímos de un motor de búsqueda comercial un subconjunto de fotos procedentes de varios foros de fotos de todo el mundo, y analizamos explícitamente las páginas web que contienen estas fotos. El número de fotos en la colección de datos es de aproximadamente 2.5 millones. Después del análisis, cada foto se asoció con su título, categoría, descripción, configuración de la cámara, datos EXIF 1 (cuando estuvieran disponibles para imágenes digitales), ubicación (cuando estuviera disponible en algunos foros de fotografía) y varios tipos de calificaciones. Todos estos metadatos son generalmente descripciones precisas o anotaciones para el contenido de la imagen, que luego son indexadas por tecnologías de búsqueda basadas en texto general [9, 18, 11]. En el sistema actual, la función de clasificación fue ajustada específicamente para enfatizar la información de título, categorización y calificación. El tema 2 se aborda esencialmente en las siguientes secciones, las cuales determinan la calidad de las fotos mediante el análisis de las calificaciones proporcionadas por varios foros de fotos en la web. Aquí elegimos seis foros de fotos para estudiar el problema de clasificación y los denominamos como Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E y Web-F. 3.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones de Fotos Se analizan detalladamente diferentes métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en esta sección. En este análisis, las cámaras digitales zero 1 guardan archivos JPEG (.jpg) con datos EXIF (Exchangeable Image File). La configuración de la cámara y la información de la escena son registradas por la cámara en el archivo de imagen. www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 6: Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones medias normalizadas a [0, 10] que suelen ocupar aproximadamente el 30% del número total de fotos en algunos foros web no se tienen en cuenta actualmente. Cómo utilizar estas fotos queda para futuras exploraciones. En la Figura 6, enumeramos las distribuciones de la puntuación media, la cual está transformada a un intervalo fijo [0, 10]. Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones promedio de estos foros web lucen bastante diferentes. Las distribuciones en las Figuras 6(a), 6(b) y 6(e) parecen distribuciones gaussianas, mientras que las de las Figuras 6(d) y 6(f) están dominadas por la puntuación más alta. La razón de estas distribuciones excéntricas para Web-D y Web-F radica en sus sistemas de calificación groseros. De hecho, Web-D y Web-F utilizan escalas de valoración de 2 o 3 puntos, mientras que otros foros web utilizan escalas de valoración de 7 u 14 puntos. Por lo tanto, será problemático si usamos directamente estos puntajes promediados. Además, es muy probable que la puntuación promedio sea manipulada si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando una foto. La Figura 7 muestra el método de normalización de puntuación total por puntajes máximos y mínimos, que es uno de nuestros sistemas de referencia. Todos los puntajes totales de un foro web dado se normalizan a [0, 100] de acuerdo con el puntaje máximo y mínimo del foro web correspondiente. Observamos que la distribución total de puntuaciones de Web-A en la Figura 7(a) tiene dos colas más grandes que todas las demás. Para mostrar la forma de las distribuciones de manera más clara, solo mostramos las distribuciones en [0, 25] en la Figura 7(b), 7(c), 7(d), 7(e) y 7(f). La Figura 8 muestra el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%, donde los modos de las seis distribuciones se normalizan a 5 y el percentil 90% a 8. Podemos ver que este método de normalización hace que las distribuciones de las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. Los dos algoritmos propuestos se basan en estos métodos de normalización. 3.3 Detección de fotos duplicadas. Dirigido a la eficiencia computacional, el algoritmo Dedup puede perder cierta tasa de recuperación, pero lograr una alta tasa de precisión. También nos enfocamos en encontrar enlaces ocultos precisos en lugar de todos los enlaces ocultos. La Figura 9 muestra algunos ejemplos de detección de duplicados. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 y verifican que existen grandes cantidades de fotos duplicadas en cualquier par de foros web, incluso con la estricta condición para la Deduplicación donde elegimos los primeros 29 bits como el código hash. Dado que solo hay unos pocos parámetros para estimar en los métodos de fusión propuestos, los números de fotos duplicadas mostrados en la Tabla 1 son 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 7: Normalización Maxmin 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 8: Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90% suficiente para determinar estos parámetros. La última columna de la tabla lista el número total de fotos en los foros web correspondientes. 3.4 δ Medida Los parámetros de los algoritmos lineales y no lineales propuestos se calculan utilizando los datos duplicados mostrados en la Tabla 1, donde se elige Web-C como el foro web de referencia ya que comparte la mayoría de las fotos duplicadas con otros foros. Las tablas 2 y 3 muestran la medida δ en el modelo lineal y el modelo no lineal. Dado que δkl es simétrico y δkk = 0, solo mostramos la parte triangular superior. Los valores NaN en ambas tablas se encuentran en que no se han detectado fotos duplicadas por el algoritmo Dedup, como se informa en la Tabla 1. El modelo lineal garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la Tabla 1: Número de fotos duplicadas entre cada par de foros web A B C D E F Escala A 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k B 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675k C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D 178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155k E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448k F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122k 383 Figura 9: Algunos resultados de la detección de fotos duplicadas Tabla 2: Medida δ en el modelo lineal. La comunidad de referencia debería ser teóricamente no menor a 0. Es, de hecho, el caso (ver los números subrayados en la Tabla 2). Pero este modelo no puede garantizar que las medidas de δ en las comunidades no referenciales también sean iguales o superiores a 0, ya que los pasos de normalización se basan en fotos duplicadas entre la comunidad de referencia y una comunidad no referencial. Los resultados muestran que todos los números en la medida δ son mayores que 0 (ver todos los números no subrayados en la Tabla 2), lo cual indica que es probable que este modelo dé resultados óptimos. Por el contrario, el modelo no lineal no garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la comunidad de referencia deban ser no inferiores a 0, ya que no todas las fotos duplicadas entre los dos foros web pueden ser utilizadas al optimizar este modelo. De hecho, las fotos duplicadas que se encuentran en intervalos diferentes no serán utilizadas en este modelo. Son estas fotos duplicadas específicas las que hacen que la medida δ sea negativa. Como resultado, hay tanto elementos negativos como positivos en la Tabla 3, pero en general el número de positivos es mayor que el de negativos (9:5), lo que indica que el modelo puede ser mejor que el método de normalización únicamente (ver siguiente subsección) que tiene una medida δ completamente nula, y peor que el modelo lineal. 3.5 Estudio de Usuario Debido a que es difícil encontrar un criterio objetivo para evaluar la Tabla 3: medida δ en el modelo no lineal. Web-B Web-C Web-D Web-E Web-F Web-A 0.0559 0.0054 -0.0185 -0.0054 NaN Web-B - -0.0162 -0.0345 -0.0301 0.0466 Web-C - - 0.0136 0.0071 0.1264 Web-D - - - 0.0032 0.0143 Web-E - - - - 0.214 qué función de clasificación es mejor, optamos por realizar estudios de usuario para evaluaciones subjetivas. Diez sujetos fueron invitados a participar en el estudio de usuarios. Fueron reclutados de universidades cercanas. Dado que los motores de búsqueda de búsqueda de texto y búsqueda de imágenes son familiares para los estudiantes universitarios, no había un criterio previo para elegir a los estudiantes. Realizamos estudios de usuarios utilizando Internet Explorer 6.0 en Windows XP con monitores LCD de 17 pulgadas configurados en 1,280 píxeles por 1,024 píxeles en color de 32 bits. Los datos fueron registrados con registros del servidor y encuestas en papel después de cada tarea. Figura 10: Interfaz del estudio de usuario. Específicamente diseñamos una interfaz para el estudio de usuario como se muestra en la Figura 10. Para cada par de métodos de fusión, se alentó a los participantes a probar cualquier consulta que desearan. Para aquellos sin ideas específicas, se enumeraron dos cuadros combinados (lista de categorías y lista de consultas) en el panel inferior, donde se proporcionaron las 1,000 consultas de búsqueda de imágenes principales de un motor de búsqueda comercial. Después de que un participante envió una consulta, el sistema seleccionó aleatoriamente el marco izquierdo o derecho para mostrar cada uno de los dos resultados de clasificación. Los participantes debían luego juzgar cuál de los dos resultados de clasificación era mejor, o si los dos resultados de clasificación tenían la misma calidad, y enviar el juicio eligiendo el botón de radio correspondiente y haciendo clic en el botón de enviar. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 10, se envía la consulta \"sunset\" al sistema. Entonces, 79,092 fotos fueron devueltas y clasificadas por el método de fusión Minmax en el marco izquierdo y el método de fusión lineal en el marco derecho. Un participante luego compara los dos resultados de clasificación (sin conocer los métodos de clasificación) y envía sus comentarios eligiendo respuestas en la opción Tuya. Tabla 4: Resultados del estudio de usuario Norm. Solo Manual Lineal Lineal 29:13:10 14:22:15 No lineal 29:15:9 12:27:12 6:4:45 La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados experimentales, donde Lineal denota el método de fusión lineal, No lineal denota el método de fusión no lineal, Norm. Solo significa el método de normalización Maxmin, Manualmente significa el método ajustado manualmente. Los tres números en cada ítem, por ejemplo 29:13:10, significan que 29 juicios prefieren los resultados de fusión lineal, 10 384 juicios prefieren el método de normalización solamente, y 13 juicios consideran que estos dos métodos son equivalentes. Realizamos el análisis de ANOVA y obtenemos las siguientes conclusiones: 1. Tanto los métodos lineales como no lineales son significativamente mejores que la Norma. El único método con valores P respectivos de 0.00165 (< 0.05) y 0.00073 (<< 0.05). Este resultado es consistente con el resultado de la evaluación de la medida δ. La norma. El único método asume que las 10% mejores fotos en diferentes foros tienen la misma calidad. Sin embargo, esta suposición no se sostiene en general. Por ejemplo, una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de primer nivel generalmente tiene una calidad superior a una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de segundo nivel. Esto es similar a eso, los estudiantes del 10% superior en una universidad de primer nivel y los de una universidad de segundo nivel suelen ser de diferente calidad. Tanto los métodos de fusión lineal como no lineal reconocen la existencia de tales diferencias y buscan cuantificarlas. Por lo tanto, ellos se desempeñan mejor que la norma. Único método. 2. El método de fusión lineal es significativamente mejor que el no lineal con un valor P de 1.195 × 10−10. Este resultado es bastante sorprendente ya que se espera que este método de clasificación más complicado ajuste la clasificación de manera más precisa que el lineal. La razón principal de este resultado puede ser que es difícil encontrar los mejores intervalos donde se debe llevar a cabo el ajuste no lineal y, sin embargo, simplemente se eligió la parte central del método de Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90%. Los métodos de evaluación que consumen mucho tiempo y son subjetivos - estudios de usuario - nos impidieron ajustar extensamente estos parámetros. 3. Los métodos lineales y no lineales propuestos tienen un rendimiento casi igual o ligeramente mejor que el método ajustado manualmente. Dado que los métodos de fusión lineal/no lineal son enfoques completamente automáticos, se consideran soluciones prácticas y eficientes cuando se necesite integrar más comunidades (por ejemplo, docenas de comunidades). 4. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJO FUTURO En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de <br>clasificación de objetos web</br> en los casos de falta de relaciones entre objetos donde los algoritmos de clasificación tradicionales ya no son válidos, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. Hemos construido un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical de alta calidad y propuesto métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas fuentes de datos (foros web) como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por el algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son una solución práctica y eficiente para la clasificación de objetos web en las relaciones mencionadas. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros tipos de objetos web, incluyendo videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, música, dibujos, esculturas, y así sucesivamente. El sistema actual está lejos de ser perfecto. Para hacer este sistema más efectivo, se necesitan análisis más delicados para el dominio vertical (por ejemplo, foros de fotos en la web). Los siguientes puntos, por ejemplo, pueden mejorar los resultados de búsqueda y serán nuestro trabajo futuro: 1. un análisis más sutil y luego la utilización de diferentes tipos de calificaciones (por ejemplo, calificaciones de novedad, calificaciones estéticas); 2. diferenciar diversas comunidades que pueden tener diferentes intereses y preferencias o incluso entendimientos culturales distintos; 3. incorporar más información útil, incluida la información de fotógrafos y revisores, para modelar las fotos en un espacio de datos heterogéneo en lugar del actual homogéneo. Utilizaremos aún más el filtrado colaborativo para recomendar fotos relevantes de alta calidad a los navegadores. Un problema abierto es si podemos encontrar un criterio objetivo y eficiente para evaluar los resultados de clasificación, en lugar de emplear estudios de usuario subjetivos e ineficientes, que nos impidieron probar más algoritmos de clasificación y ajustar parámetros en un algoritmo.

                "49, Zhichun Road Haidian District, Beijing, 100080, P R China ABSTRACT Vertical search is a promising direction as it leverages domainspecific knowledge and can provide more precise information for users.",
                "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.",
                "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "We proposed two <br>score fusion method</br>s that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval; G.2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory; H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services - Web-based services General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
                "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",
                "EXPERIMENTS In this section, we carry out our research on high-quality photo search.",
                "We first briefly introduce the newly proposed vertical image search engine - EnjoyPhoto in section 3.1.",
                "Then we focus on how to rank photos from different Web forums.",
                "In order to do so, we first normalize the scores (ratings) for photos from different multiple Web forums in section 3.2.",
                "Then we try to find duplicate photos in section 3.3.",
                "Some intermediate results are discussed using δ measure in section 3.4.",
                "Finally a set of user studies is carried out carefully to justify our proposed method in section 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: high-quality Photo Search Engine In order to meet user requirement of enjoying high-quality photos, we propose and build a high-quality photo search engine - EnjoyPhoto, which accounts for the following three key issues: 1. how to crawl and index photos, 2. how to determine the qualities of each photo and 3. how to display the search results in order to make the search process enjoyable.",
                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",
                "As for Issue 3, we devise the interface of the system deliberately in order to smooth the users process of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Techniques, such as Fisheye and slides show, are utilized in current system.",

                "The number of photos in the data collection is about 2.5 million.",
                "After the parsing, each photo was associated with its title, category, description, camera setting, EXIF data 1 (when available for digital images), location (when available in some photo forums), and many kinds of ratings.",
                "All these metadata are generally precise descriptions or annotations for the image content, which are then indexed by general text-based search technologies [9, 18, 11].",
                "In current system, the ranking function was specifically tuned to emphasize title, categorization, and rating information.",

                "The reason of these eccentric distributions for Web-D and Web-F lies in their coarse rating systems.",
                "In fact, Web-D and Web-F use 2 or 3 point rating scales whereas other Web forums use 7 or 14 point rating scales.",
                "Therefore, it will be problematic if we directly use these averaged scores.",
                "Furthermore the average score is very likely to be spammed, if there are only a few users rating a photo.",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos <br>métodos de fusión de puntuaciones</br> que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música.

A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de objetos web en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2. ALGORITMO 2.1 Resumen La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web radica en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente existen dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros utilizan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros utilizan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o de 10 puntos. Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero un análisis detallado de los datos y experimentos muestra que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, la misma puntuación no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. De manera intuitiva, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos establecer relaciones entre cualquier par de foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante la normalización y transformación de puntuaciones. Afortunadamente, descubrimos que existe un buen número de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos en la web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de obtener una amplia difusión. En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente de detección de fotos duplicadas [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Ante la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se requiere un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como el foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas deberían ser iguales aunque estén en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes foros, excepto en el foro de referencia, pueden variar en un espacio paramétrico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntuación. Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer que las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas en foros no de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible a las del foro de referencia, podemos resolver eficazmente el problema de clasificación. Para mayor comodidad, se emplean las siguientes notaciones. Ski y ¯Ski denotan la puntuación total y la puntuación media del i-ésimo objeto web (foto) en el k-ésimo sitio web, respectivamente. La puntuación total se refiere a la suma de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación (por ejemplo, la puntuación de novedad y la puntuación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Además, utilizamos {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} para denotar el conjunto de puntuaciones de objetos web (fotos) en los foros web k-ésimos que son duplicados con los foros web l-ésimos, donde Ikl es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusión de puntuaciones se puede ver como el procedimiento de encontrar K transformaciones ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K de manera que eSki se pueda utilizar para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma un subgrafo, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas). El párrafo puede formularse como min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 como el foro de referencia y por lo tanto ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que puede establecerse heurísticamente según el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro no de referencia. Cuanto más revisores haya, más popular será la foto y mayor debería ser el peso correspondiente ¯wk i. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk i y simplemente los establecemos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk i, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea mencionada anteriormente. La Comunidad Web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web enlazados son en realidad el mismo. El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., K), el cual tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo a ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la Ecuación 1, se realiza la suma en todas las líneas punteadas rojas. Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en la Sección 2.2, que servirá como base para el trabajo siguiente. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método ajustado manualmente en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso impráctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar de manera precisa fotos duplicadas entre foros web. Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: Fusión lineal y Fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5. Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algunos otros trabajos relacionados. 2.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones Dado que los diferentes foros web (de fotos) en la web suelen tener diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión. Además, dado que existen muchos tipos de calificaciones, como calificaciones para novedad, calificaciones para estética, etc., es razonable elegir una común, como la puntuación total o la puntuación promedio, que siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calcular a partir de las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el método de normalización en la puntuación total o puntuación promedio sea visto como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar las puntuaciones promedio mediante su transformación lineal a un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntuación como Puntuación Media Escalada. La dificultad, sin embargo, de utilizar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que la puntuación promedio para el objeto sea manipulada o sesgada. La puntuación total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como la calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema radica en cómo normalizar las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros web. La forma más sencilla puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas. La desventaja de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos. Para hacer que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%. Aquí, la puntuación modal representa la puntuación total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total. Y El puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de las imágenes tiene un puntaje total más bajo. Este método de normalización utiliza la moda y el percentil 90 como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo en diferentes foros de fotografía, es que aunque las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar considerablemente y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad intermedia (desde la moda hasta el percentil 90) debería ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (rigurosidad) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel intermedio en un foro web suelen ocupar más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un análisis más detallado de las puntuaciones en la Sección 3.2. 2.3 Fusión Manual El foro de películas en la web, IMDB [16], propuso utilizar una función de clasificación bayesiana para normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación dentro de una comunidad. Motivados por esta función de clasificación, proponemos este método de fusión manual: Para el k-ésimo sitio web, utilizamos la siguiente fórmula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) para clasificar fotos, donde nk es el número de votos y n∗ k, S∗ k y αk son tres parámetros. Esta función de clasificación primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuación media original ¯Ski y una puntuación de referencia S∗ k para obtener una puntuación media ponderada que puede ser más confiable que ¯Ski. Entonces, la puntuación media ponderada se escala por αk para obtener la puntuación final fSki. Para n comunidades web, hay aproximadamente 3n parámetros en {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} para ajustar. Aunque este método puede lograr resultados bastante buenos después de ajustes manuales cuidadosos y exhaustivos en estos parámetros, cuando n se vuelve cada vez más grande, por ejemplo, si hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web rastreadas e indexadas, este método se volverá cada vez más laborioso y eventualmente se volverá impracticable. Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un método de fusión efectivo cuyos parámetros puedan determinarse automáticamente. 2.4 Detección de Fotos Duplicadas Utilizamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo eficiente y efectivo de detección de imágenes duplicadas, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre cualquier par de foros de fotos. Este algoritmo utiliza una función hash para mapear una característica de alta dimensión a un código hash de 32 bits (ver abajo para cómo construir el código hash). La complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imágenes duplicadas entre n imágenes es aproximadamente O(n log n). La característica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrículas regulares de k × k. Basándose en todas las características extraídas de la base de datos de imágenes, se construye un modelo de PCA. Las características visuales son luego transformadas a un espacio PCA de baja dimensionalidad y media cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema. Entonces, el código hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensión se transforma en uno si el valor en esta dimensión es mayor que 0, y en 0 en caso contrario. Las fotos en el mismo grupo se consideran posibles duplicados y se filtran aún más por un umbral en términos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de características visuales. La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde se extraen características visuales - valores de gris promedio - en cuadrículas de 6 × 6 y 7 × 7. Las características de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el código hash se genera de acuerdo a los signos. Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la detección de fotos duplicadas. 2.5 Fusión de Puntuaciones En esta sección, presentaremos dos soluciones sobre la fusión de puntuaciones basadas en diferentes suposiciones de forma paramétrica de ψk en la Ecuación 1. 2.5.1 Fusión Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas. Intuitivamente, la forma más directa de eliminar las incertidumbres causadas por los diferentes criterios es escalar, relativo a un centro dado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foto de foro web no referenciada con respecto al foro de referencia. Más estrictamente, asumimos que ψk tiene la siguiente forma ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones del foro k(= 1) deben escalarse por αk en relación al centro tk 1−αk, como se muestra en la Figura 3. Entonces, si sustituimos ψk anterior en la Ec. 1, obtenemos la siguiente función objetivo, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K donde f es la función objetivo definida en la Ec. 5, obtenemos la solución en forma cerrada como: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) donde Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un método de fusión lineal. Disfruta de la simplicidad y el excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos. Figura 3: Método de Fusión Lineal 2.5.2 Fusión No Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas A veces queremos un método que pueda ajustar puntuaciones en intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios. Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el método puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] dejando las puntuaciones C0 y C1 sin cambios. Este tipo de método de fusión es mucho más refinado que los lineales y contiene muchos más parámetros para ajustar y se espera que mejore aún más los resultados. Aquí proponemos una solución de fusión no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones. Primero, introducimos una transformación: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, si x ∈ (c0, c1] x en otro caso donde α > 0. Esta transformación satisface que para x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] con ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 y ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1. Luego podemos utilizar esta transformación no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figura 4: Método de fusión no lineal. Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento. Aunque no hay una solución en forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimización, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2, no es difícil obtener la solución numérica. Bajo las mismas suposiciones hechas en la Sección 2.2, podemos utilizar este método para ajustar las puntuaciones de nivel intermedio (desde el punto de la moda hasta el percentil 90). Se espera que este método de fusión no lineal más complicado logre mejores resultados que el lineal. Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parámetros de manera exhaustiva. Los experimentos actuales en la Sección 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple. 2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de fusión Dado que nuestra función objetivo es hacer que las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro no referencial y el foro de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible, es natural investigar qué tan cerca llegan a estar entre sí y cómo cambian las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web entre los dos foros no referenciales antes y después de la fusión de puntuaciones. Tomando la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la Comunidad Web 1) y un foro no de referencia, lo que corresponde a minimizar la función objetivo en los enlaces rojos discontinuos (ocultos). Después de la optimización, debemos preguntarnos qué sucede con las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros no de referencia. O, en otras palabras, ¿se vuelven más consistentes las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces verdes discontinuos (ocultos)? Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de rendimiento δ para cuantificar los cambios en las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web como δkl = Sim(Slk, Skl) - Sim(Slk ∗, Skl ∗) (10) donde Skl = (Skl 1, ..., Skl Ikl)T, Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1, ..., eSkl Ikl)T y Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b||. δkl > 0 significa que después de la fusión de puntuaciones, las puntuaciones en los mismos objetos web entre el k-ésimo y el l-ésimo foro web se vuelven más consistentes, lo cual es lo que esperamos. Por el contrario, si δkl < 0, esas puntuaciones se vuelven más inconsistentes. Aunque no podemos depender de esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusión, ya que clasificar fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificación intermedios y proporcionar información sobre el rendimiento final de diferentes métodos de clasificación. 2.6 Contrastes con Otros Trabajos Relacionados Ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los métodos propuestos con los métodos tradicionales, como PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y los algoritmos de LinkFusion [27] en la Sección 1. Aquí discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas. El problema actual también puede ser visto como un problema de agregación de rangos [13, 14] ya que tratamos con la cuestión de cómo combinar varias listas de rangos. Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos. En primer lugar, a diferencia de las páginas web, que pueden ser detectadas fácil y precisamente como las mismas páginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados con cierta precisión y recuperación. Segundo, los números de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeños en comparación con el total de conjuntos de fotos (ver Tabla 1). En otras palabras, las listas de clasificación de los K mejores de diferentes foros web son casi disjuntas para una consulta dada. Bajo esta condición, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como sus medidas - distancia de Kendall tau o distancia de la regla de Spearman - degenerarán en algunos casos triviales. Otra categoría de métodos de fusión de rangos (agregación) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automático, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12]. Todos estos métodos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo. En la configuración actual, es difícil o incluso imposible etiquetar estos conjuntos de datos según su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para clasificar. En cambio, el problema aquí es cómo combinar varias sub listas ordenadas para formar una lista de orden total. 3. EXPERIMENTOS En esta sección, llevamos a cabo nuestra investigación sobre la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. Primero presentamos brevemente el nuevo motor de búsqueda de imágenes verticales propuesto - EnjoyPhoto en la sección 3.1. Luego nos enfocamos en cómo clasificar fotos de diferentes foros web. Para hacerlo, primero normalizamos las puntuaciones (calificaciones) de las fotos de diferentes foros web múltiples en la sección 3.2. Luego intentamos encontrar fotos duplicadas en la sección 3.3. Algunos resultados intermedios se discuten utilizando la medida δ en la sección 3.4. Finalmente se lleva a cabo un conjunto de estudios de usuarios cuidadosamente para justificar nuestro método propuesto en la sección 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: Motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad Para cumplir con el requisito de los usuarios de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, proponemos y construimos un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad - EnjoyPhoto, que aborda los siguientes tres problemas clave: 1. cómo rastrear e indexar fotos, 2. cómo determinar las cualidades de cada foto y 3. cómo mostrar los resultados de búsqueda para hacer que el proceso de búsqueda sea agradable. Para una consulta de texto dada, este sistema clasifica las fotos basándose en una cierta combinación de la relevancia de la foto para esta consulta (Problema 1) y la calidad de la foto (Problema 2), y finalmente las muestra de una manera agradable (Problema 3). En cuanto al tema 3, diseñamos la interfaz del sistema deliberadamente para facilitar el proceso de los usuarios al disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Técnicas como Fisheye y presentación de diapositivas son utilizadas en el sistema actual. La Figura 5 muestra la interfaz. No hablaremos más sobre este tema ya que no es un énfasis de este documento. Figura 5: EnjoyPhoto: un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad y agradable, donde se devuelven 26,477 registros para la consulta de otoño en aproximadamente 0.421 segundos. En cuanto al tema 1, extraímos de un motor de búsqueda comercial un subconjunto de fotos procedentes de varios foros de fotos de todo el mundo, y analizamos explícitamente las páginas web que contienen estas fotos. El número de fotos en la colección de datos es de aproximadamente 2.5 millones. Después del análisis, cada foto se asoció con su título, categoría, descripción, configuración de la cámara, datos EXIF 1 (cuando estuvieran disponibles para imágenes digitales), ubicación (cuando estuviera disponible en algunos foros de fotografía) y varios tipos de calificaciones. Todos estos metadatos son generalmente descripciones precisas o anotaciones para el contenido de la imagen, que luego son indexadas por tecnologías de búsqueda basadas en texto general [9, 18, 11]. En el sistema actual, la función de clasificación fue ajustada específicamente para enfatizar la información de título, categorización y calificación. El tema 2 se aborda esencialmente en las siguientes secciones, las cuales determinan la calidad de las fotos mediante el análisis de las calificaciones proporcionadas por varios foros de fotos en la web. Aquí elegimos seis foros de fotos para estudiar el problema de clasificación y los denominamos como Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E y Web-F. 3.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones de Fotos Se analizan detalladamente diferentes métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en esta sección. En este análisis, las cámaras digitales zero 1 guardan archivos JPEG (.jpg) con datos EXIF (Exchangeable Image File). La configuración de la cámara y la información de la escena son registradas por la cámara en el archivo de imagen. www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 6: Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones medias normalizadas a [0, 10] que suelen ocupar aproximadamente el 30% del número total de fotos en algunos foros web no se tienen en cuenta actualmente. Cómo utilizar estas fotos queda para futuras exploraciones. En la Figura 6, enumeramos las distribuciones de la puntuación media, la cual está transformada a un intervalo fijo [0, 10]. Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones promedio de estos foros web lucen bastante diferentes. Las distribuciones en las Figuras 6(a), 6(b) y 6(e) parecen distribuciones gaussianas, mientras que las de las Figuras 6(d) y 6(f) están dominadas por la puntuación más alta. La razón de estas distribuciones excéntricas para Web-D y Web-F radica en sus sistemas de calificación groseros. De hecho, Web-D y Web-F utilizan escalas de valoración de 2 o 3 puntos, mientras que otros foros web utilizan escalas de valoración de 7 u 14 puntos. Por lo tanto, será problemático si usamos directamente estos puntajes promediados. Además, es muy probable que la puntuación promedio sea manipulada si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando una foto. La Figura 7 muestra el método de normalización de puntuación total por puntajes máximos y mínimos, que es uno de nuestros sistemas de referencia. Todos los puntajes totales de un foro web dado se normalizan a [0, 100] de acuerdo con el puntaje máximo y mínimo del foro web correspondiente. Observamos que la distribución total de puntuaciones de Web-A en la Figura 7(a) tiene dos colas más grandes que todas las demás. Para mostrar la forma de las distribuciones de manera más clara, solo mostramos las distribuciones en [0, 25] en la Figura 7(b), 7(c), 7(d), 7(e) y 7(f). La Figura 8 muestra el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%, donde los modos de las seis distribuciones se normalizan a 5 y el percentil 90% a 8. Podemos ver que este método de normalización hace que las distribuciones de las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. Los dos algoritmos propuestos se basan en estos métodos de normalización. 3.3 Detección de fotos duplicadas. Dirigido a la eficiencia computacional, el algoritmo Dedup puede perder cierta tasa de recuperación, pero lograr una alta tasa de precisión. También nos enfocamos en encontrar enlaces ocultos precisos en lugar de todos los enlaces ocultos. La Figura 9 muestra algunos ejemplos de detección de duplicados. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 y verifican que existen grandes cantidades de fotos duplicadas en cualquier par de foros web, incluso con la estricta condición para la Deduplicación donde elegimos los primeros 29 bits como el código hash. Dado que solo hay unos pocos parámetros para estimar en los métodos de fusión propuestos, los números de fotos duplicadas mostrados en la Tabla 1 son 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 7: Normalización Maxmin 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 8: Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90% suficiente para determinar estos parámetros. La última columna de la tabla lista el número total de fotos en los foros web correspondientes. 3.4 δ Medida Los parámetros de los algoritmos lineales y no lineales propuestos se calculan utilizando los datos duplicados mostrados en la Tabla 1, donde se elige Web-C como el foro web de referencia ya que comparte la mayoría de las fotos duplicadas con otros foros. Las tablas 2 y 3 muestran la medida δ en el modelo lineal y el modelo no lineal. Dado que δkl es simétrico y δkk = 0, solo mostramos la parte triangular superior. Los valores NaN en ambas tablas se encuentran en que no se han detectado fotos duplicadas por el algoritmo Dedup, como se informa en la Tabla 1. El modelo lineal garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la Tabla 1: Número de fotos duplicadas entre cada par de foros web A B C D E F Escala A 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k B 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675k C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D 178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155k E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448k F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122k 383 Figura 9: Algunos resultados de la detección de fotos duplicadas Tabla 2: Medida δ en el modelo lineal. La comunidad de referencia debería ser teóricamente no menor a 0. Es, de hecho, el caso (ver los números subrayados en la Tabla 2). Pero este modelo no puede garantizar que las medidas de δ en las comunidades no referenciales también sean iguales o superiores a 0, ya que los pasos de normalización se basan en fotos duplicadas entre la comunidad de referencia y una comunidad no referencial. Los resultados muestran que todos los números en la medida δ son mayores que 0 (ver todos los números no subrayados en la Tabla 2), lo cual indica que es probable que este modelo dé resultados óptimos. Por el contrario, el modelo no lineal no garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la comunidad de referencia deban ser no inferiores a 0, ya que no todas las fotos duplicadas entre los dos foros web pueden ser utilizadas al optimizar este modelo. De hecho, las fotos duplicadas que se encuentran en intervalos diferentes no serán utilizadas en este modelo. Son estas fotos duplicadas específicas las que hacen que la medida δ sea negativa. Como resultado, hay tanto elementos negativos como positivos en la Tabla 3, pero en general el número de positivos es mayor que el de negativos (9:5), lo que indica que el modelo puede ser mejor que el método de normalización únicamente (ver siguiente subsección) que tiene una medida δ completamente nula, y peor que el modelo lineal. 3.5 Estudio de Usuario Debido a que es difícil encontrar un criterio objetivo para evaluar la Tabla 3: medida δ en el modelo no lineal. Web-B Web-C Web-D Web-E Web-F Web-A 0.0559 0.0054 -0.0185 -0.0054 NaN Web-B - -0.0162 -0.0345 -0.0301 0.0466 Web-C - - 0.0136 0.0071 0.1264 Web-D - - - 0.0032 0.0143 Web-E - - - - 0.214 qué función de clasificación es mejor, optamos por realizar estudios de usuario para evaluaciones subjetivas. Diez sujetos fueron invitados a participar en el estudio de usuarios. Fueron reclutados de universidades cercanas. Dado que los motores de búsqueda de búsqueda de texto y búsqueda de imágenes son familiares para los estudiantes universitarios, no había un criterio previo para elegir a los estudiantes. Realizamos estudios de usuarios utilizando Internet Explorer 6.0 en Windows XP con monitores LCD de 17 pulgadas configurados en 1,280 píxeles por 1,024 píxeles en color de 32 bits. Los datos fueron registrados con registros del servidor y encuestas en papel después de cada tarea. Figura 10: Interfaz del estudio de usuario. Específicamente diseñamos una interfaz para el estudio de usuario como se muestra en la Figura 10. Para cada par de métodos de fusión, se alentó a los participantes a probar cualquier consulta que desearan. Para aquellos sin ideas específicas, se enumeraron dos cuadros combinados (lista de categorías y lista de consultas) en el panel inferior, donde se proporcionaron las 1,000 consultas de búsqueda de imágenes principales de un motor de búsqueda comercial. Después de que un participante envió una consulta, el sistema seleccionó aleatoriamente el marco izquierdo o derecho para mostrar cada uno de los dos resultados de clasificación. Los participantes debían luego juzgar cuál de los dos resultados de clasificación era mejor, o si los dos resultados de clasificación tenían la misma calidad, y enviar el juicio eligiendo el botón de radio correspondiente y haciendo clic en el botón de enviar. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 10, se envía la consulta \"sunset\" al sistema. Entonces, 79,092 fotos fueron devueltas y clasificadas por el método de fusión Minmax en el marco izquierdo y el método de fusión lineal en el marco derecho. Un participante luego compara los dos resultados de clasificación (sin conocer los métodos de clasificación) y envía sus comentarios eligiendo respuestas en la opción Tuya. Tabla 4: Resultados del estudio de usuario Norm. Solo Manual Lineal Lineal 29:13:10 14:22:15 No lineal 29:15:9 12:27:12 6:4:45 La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados experimentales, donde Lineal denota el método de fusión lineal, No lineal denota el método de fusión no lineal, Norm. Solo significa el método de normalización Maxmin, Manualmente significa el método ajustado manualmente. Los tres números en cada ítem, por ejemplo 29:13:10, significan que 29 juicios prefieren los resultados de fusión lineal, 10 384 juicios prefieren el método de normalización solamente, y 13 juicios consideran que estos dos métodos son equivalentes. Realizamos el análisis de ANOVA y obtenemos las siguientes conclusiones: 1. Tanto los métodos lineales como no lineales son significativamente mejores que la Norma. El único método con valores P respectivos de 0.00165 (< 0.05) y 0.00073 (<< 0.05). Este resultado es consistente con el resultado de la evaluación de la medida δ. La norma. El único método asume que las 10% mejores fotos en diferentes foros tienen la misma calidad. Sin embargo, esta suposición no se sostiene en general. Por ejemplo, una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de primer nivel generalmente tiene una calidad superior a una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de segundo nivel. Esto es similar a eso, los estudiantes del 10% superior en una universidad de primer nivel y los de una universidad de segundo nivel suelen ser de diferente calidad. Tanto los métodos de fusión lineal como no lineal reconocen la existencia de tales diferencias y buscan cuantificarlas. Por lo tanto, ellos se desempeñan mejor que la norma. Único método. 2. El método de fusión lineal es significativamente mejor que el no lineal con un valor P de 1.195 × 10−10. Este resultado es bastante sorprendente ya que se espera que este método de clasificación más complicado ajuste la clasificación de manera más precisa que el lineal. La razón principal de este resultado puede ser que es difícil encontrar los mejores intervalos donde se debe llevar a cabo el ajuste no lineal y, sin embargo, simplemente se eligió la parte central del método de Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90%. Los métodos de evaluación que consumen mucho tiempo y son subjetivos - estudios de usuario - nos impidieron ajustar extensamente estos parámetros. 3. Los métodos lineales y no lineales propuestos tienen un rendimiento casi igual o ligeramente mejor que el método ajustado manualmente. Dado que los métodos de fusión lineal/no lineal son enfoques completamente automáticos, se consideran soluciones prácticas y eficientes cuando se necesite integrar más comunidades (por ejemplo, docenas de comunidades). 4. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJO FUTURO En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web en los casos de falta de relaciones entre objetos donde los algoritmos de clasificación tradicionales ya no son válidos, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. Hemos construido un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical de alta calidad y propuesto <br>métodos de fusión de puntuaciones</br> que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas fuentes de datos (foros web) como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por el algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son una solución práctica y eficiente para la clasificación de objetos web en las relaciones mencionadas. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros tipos de objetos web, incluyendo videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, música, dibujos, esculturas, y así sucesivamente. El sistema actual está lejos de ser perfecto. Para hacer este sistema más efectivo, se necesitan análisis más delicados para el dominio vertical (por ejemplo, foros de fotos en la web). Los siguientes puntos, por ejemplo, pueden mejorar los resultados de búsqueda y serán nuestro trabajo futuro: 1. un análisis más sutil y luego la utilización de diferentes tipos de calificaciones (por ejemplo, calificaciones de novedad, calificaciones estéticas); 2. diferenciar diversas comunidades que pueden tener diferentes intereses y preferencias o incluso entendimientos culturales distintos; 3. incorporar más información útil, incluida la información de fotógrafos y revisores, para modelar las fotos en un espacio de datos heterogéneo en lugar del actual homogéneo. Utilizaremos aún más el filtrado colaborativo para recomendar fotos relevantes de alta calidad a los navegadores. Un problema abierto es si podemos encontrar un criterio objetivo y eficiente para evaluar los resultados de clasificación, en lugar de emplear estudios de usuario subjetivos e ineficientes, que nos impidieron probar más algoritmos de clasificación y ajustar parámetros en un algoritmo.

                "49, Zhichun Road Haidian District, Beijing, 100080, P R China ABSTRACT Vertical search is a promising direction as it leverages domainspecific knowledge and can provide more precise information for users.",
                "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.",
                "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take <br>high-quality photo search</br> as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval; G.2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory; H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services - Web-based services General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "<br>high-quality photo search</br>, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
                "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take <br>high-quality photo search</br> as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building <br>high-quality photo search</br>. 1.1 <br>high-quality photo search</br> In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",

                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K.

                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",

                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la <br>búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad</br> como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información; G.2.2 [Matemáticas Discretas]: Teoría de Grafos; H.3.5 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Servicios de Información en Línea - Servicios basados en la web Términos Generales Algoritmos, Experimentación 1. A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La <br>búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad</br>, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de objetos web en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la <br>búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad</br> como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una <br>búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad</br>. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2. ALGORITMO 2.1 Resumen La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web radica en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente existen dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros utilizan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros utilizan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o de 10 puntos. Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero un análisis detallado de los datos y experimentos muestra que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, la misma puntuación no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. De manera intuitiva, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos establecer relaciones entre cualquier par de foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante la normalización y transformación de puntuaciones. Afortunadamente, descubrimos que existe un buen número de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos en la web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de obtener una amplia difusión. En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente de detección de fotos duplicadas [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Ante la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se requiere un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como el foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas deberían ser iguales aunque estén en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes foros, excepto en el foro de referencia, pueden variar en un espacio paramétrico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntuación. Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer que las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas en foros no de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible a las del foro de referencia, podemos resolver eficazmente el problema de clasificación. Para mayor comodidad, se emplean las siguientes notaciones. Ski y ¯Ski denotan la puntuación total y la puntuación media del i-ésimo objeto web (foto) en el k-ésimo sitio web, respectivamente. La puntuación total se refiere a la suma de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación (por ejemplo, la puntuación de novedad y la puntuación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Además, utilizamos {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} para denotar el conjunto de puntuaciones de objetos web (fotos) en los foros web k-ésimos que son duplicados con los foros web l-ésimos, donde Ikl es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusión de puntuaciones se puede ver como el procedimiento de encontrar K transformaciones ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K de manera que eSki se pueda utilizar para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma un subgrafo, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas). El párrafo puede formularse como min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 como el foro de referencia y por lo tanto ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que puede establecerse heurísticamente según el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro no de referencia. Cuanto más revisores haya, más popular será la foto y mayor debería ser el peso correspondiente ¯wk i. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk i y simplemente los establecemos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk i, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea mencionada anteriormente. La Comunidad Web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web enlazados son en realidad el mismo. El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., K), el cual tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo a ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la Ecuación 1, se realiza la suma en todas las líneas punteadas rojas. Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en la Sección 2.2, que servirá como base para el trabajo siguiente. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método ajustado manualmente en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso impráctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar de manera precisa fotos duplicadas entre foros web. Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: Fusión lineal y Fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5. Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algunos otros trabajos relacionados. 2.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones Dado que los diferentes foros web (de fotos) en la web suelen tener diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión. Además, dado que existen muchos tipos de calificaciones, como calificaciones para novedad, calificaciones para estética, etc., es razonable elegir una común, como la puntuación total o la puntuación promedio, que siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calcular a partir de las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el método de normalización en la puntuación total o puntuación promedio sea visto como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar las puntuaciones promedio mediante su transformación lineal a un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntuación como Puntuación Media Escalada. La dificultad, sin embargo, de utilizar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que la puntuación promedio para el objeto sea manipulada o sesgada. La puntuación total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como la calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema radica en cómo normalizar las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros web. La forma más sencilla puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas. La desventaja de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos. Para hacer que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%. Aquí, la puntuación modal representa la puntuación total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total. Y El puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de las imágenes tiene un puntaje total más bajo. Este método de normalización utiliza la moda y el percentil 90 como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo en diferentes foros de fotografía, es que aunque las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar considerablemente y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad intermedia (desde la moda hasta el percentil 90) debería ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (rigurosidad) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel intermedio en un foro web suelen ocupar más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un análisis más detallado de las puntuaciones en la Sección 3.2. 2.3 Fusión Manual El foro de películas en la web, IMDB [16], propuso utilizar una función de clasificación bayesiana para normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación dentro de una comunidad. Motivados por esta función de clasificación, proponemos este método de fusión manual: Para el k-ésimo sitio web, utilizamos la siguiente fórmula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) para clasificar fotos, donde nk es el número de votos y n∗ k, S∗ k y αk son tres parámetros. Esta función de clasificación primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuación media original ¯Ski y una puntuación de referencia S∗ k para obtener una puntuación media ponderada que puede ser más confiable que ¯Ski. Entonces, la puntuación media ponderada se escala por αk para obtener la puntuación final fSki. Para n comunidades web, hay aproximadamente 3n parámetros en {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} para ajustar. Aunque este método puede lograr resultados bastante buenos después de ajustes manuales cuidadosos y exhaustivos en estos parámetros, cuando n se vuelve cada vez más grande, por ejemplo, si hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web rastreadas e indexadas, este método se volverá cada vez más laborioso y eventualmente se volverá impracticable. Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un método de fusión efectivo cuyos parámetros puedan determinarse automáticamente. 2.4 Detección de Fotos Duplicadas Utilizamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo eficiente y efectivo de detección de imágenes duplicadas, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre cualquier par de foros de fotos. Este algoritmo utiliza una función hash para mapear una característica de alta dimensión a un código hash de 32 bits (ver abajo para cómo construir el código hash). La complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imágenes duplicadas entre n imágenes es aproximadamente O(n log n). La característica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrículas regulares de k × k. Basándose en todas las características extraídas de la base de datos de imágenes, se construye un modelo de PCA. Las características visuales son luego transformadas a un espacio PCA de baja dimensionalidad y media cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema. Entonces, el código hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensión se transforma en uno si el valor en esta dimensión es mayor que 0, y en 0 en caso contrario. Las fotos en el mismo grupo se consideran posibles duplicados y se filtran aún más por un umbral en términos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de características visuales. La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde se extraen características visuales - valores de gris promedio - en cuadrículas de 6 × 6 y 7 × 7. Las características de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el código hash se genera de acuerdo a los signos. Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la detección de fotos duplicadas. 2.5 Fusión de Puntuaciones En esta sección, presentaremos dos soluciones sobre la fusión de puntuaciones basadas en diferentes suposiciones de forma paramétrica de ψk en la Ecuación 1. 2.5.1 Fusión Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas. Intuitivamente, la forma más directa de eliminar las incertidumbres causadas por los diferentes criterios es escalar, relativo a un centro dado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foto de foro web no referenciada con respecto al foro de referencia. Más estrictamente, asumimos que ψk tiene la siguiente forma ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones del foro k(= 1) deben escalarse por αk en relación al centro tk 1−αk, como se muestra en la Figura 3. Entonces, si sustituimos ψk anterior en la Ec. 1, obtenemos la siguiente función objetivo, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K donde f es la función objetivo definida en la Ec. 5, obtenemos la solución en forma cerrada como: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) donde Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un método de fusión lineal. Disfruta de la simplicidad y el excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos. Figura 3: Método de Fusión Lineal 2.5.2 Fusión No Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas A veces queremos un método que pueda ajustar puntuaciones en intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios. Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el método puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] dejando las puntuaciones C0 y C1 sin cambios. Este tipo de método de fusión es mucho más refinado que los lineales y contiene muchos más parámetros para ajustar y se espera que mejore aún más los resultados. Aquí proponemos una solución de fusión no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones. Primero, introducimos una transformación: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, si x ∈ (c0, c1] x en otro caso donde α > 0. Esta transformación satisface que para x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] con ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 y ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1. Luego podemos utilizar esta transformación no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figura 4: Método de fusión no lineal. Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento. Aunque no hay una solución en forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimización, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2, no es difícil obtener la solución numérica. Bajo las mismas suposiciones hechas en la Sección 2.2, podemos utilizar este método para ajustar las puntuaciones de nivel intermedio (desde el punto de la moda hasta el percentil 90). Se espera que este método de fusión no lineal más complicado logre mejores resultados que el lineal. Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parámetros de manera exhaustiva. Los experimentos actuales en la Sección 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple. 2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de fusión Dado que nuestra función objetivo es hacer que las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro no referencial y el foro de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible, es natural investigar qué tan cerca llegan a estar entre sí y cómo cambian las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web entre los dos foros no referenciales antes y después de la fusión de puntuaciones. Tomando la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la Comunidad Web 1) y un foro no de referencia, lo que corresponde a minimizar la función objetivo en los enlaces rojos discontinuos (ocultos). Después de la optimización, debemos preguntarnos qué sucede con las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros no de referencia. O, en otras palabras, ¿se vuelven más consistentes las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces verdes discontinuos (ocultos)? Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de rendimiento δ para cuantificar los cambios en las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web como δkl = Sim(Slk, Skl) - Sim(Slk ∗, Skl ∗) (10) donde Skl = (Skl 1, ..., Skl Ikl)T, Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1, ..., eSkl Ikl)T y Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b||. δkl > 0 significa que después de la fusión de puntuaciones, las puntuaciones en los mismos objetos web entre el k-ésimo y el l-ésimo foro web se vuelven más consistentes, lo cual es lo que esperamos. Por el contrario, si δkl < 0, esas puntuaciones se vuelven más inconsistentes. Aunque no podemos depender de esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusión, ya que clasificar fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificación intermedios y proporcionar información sobre el rendimiento final de diferentes métodos de clasificación. 2.6 Contrastes con Otros Trabajos Relacionados Ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los métodos propuestos con los métodos tradicionales, como PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y los algoritmos de LinkFusion [27] en la Sección 1. Aquí discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas. El problema actual también puede ser visto como un problema de agregación de rangos [13, 14] ya que tratamos con la cuestión de cómo combinar varias listas de rangos. Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos. En primer lugar, a diferencia de las páginas web, que pueden ser detectadas fácil y precisamente como las mismas páginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados con cierta precisión y recuperación. Segundo, los números de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeños en comparación con el total de conjuntos de fotos (ver Tabla 1). En otras palabras, las listas de clasificación de los K mejores de diferentes foros web son casi disjuntas para una consulta dada. Bajo esta condición, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como sus medidas - distancia de Kendall tau o distancia de la regla de Spearman - degenerarán en algunos casos triviales. Otra categoría de métodos de fusión de rangos (agregación) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automático, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12]. Todos estos métodos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo. En la configuración actual, es difícil o incluso imposible etiquetar estos conjuntos de datos según su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para clasificar. En cambio, el problema aquí es cómo combinar varias sub listas ordenadas para formar una lista de orden total. 3.

                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",

                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of <br>image search queries</br> are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",

                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",

                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información; G.2.2 [Matemáticas Discretas]: Teoría de Grafos; H.3.5 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Servicios de Información en Línea - Servicios basados en la web Términos Generales Algoritmos, Experimentación 1. A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de objetos web en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las <br>consultas de búsqueda de imágenes</br> están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2. ALGORITMO 2.1 Resumen La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web radica en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente existen dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros utilizan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros utilizan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o de 10 puntos. Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero un análisis detallado de los datos y experimentos muestra que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, la misma puntuación no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. De manera intuitiva, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos establecer relaciones entre cualquier par de foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante la normalización y transformación de puntuaciones. Afortunadamente, descubrimos que existe un buen número de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos en la web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de obtener una amplia difusión. En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente de detección de fotos duplicadas [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Ante la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se requiere un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como el foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas deberían ser iguales aunque estén en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes foros, excepto en el foro de referencia, pueden variar en un espacio paramétrico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntuación. Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer que las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas en foros no de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible a las del foro de referencia, podemos resolver eficazmente el problema de clasificación. Para mayor comodidad, se emplean las siguientes notaciones. Ski y ¯Ski denotan la puntuación total y la puntuación media del i-ésimo objeto web (foto) en el k-ésimo sitio web, respectivamente. La puntuación total se refiere a la suma de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación (por ejemplo, la puntuación de novedad y la puntuación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Además, utilizamos {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} para denotar el conjunto de puntuaciones de objetos web (fotos) en los foros web k-ésimos que son duplicados con los foros web l-ésimos, donde Ikl es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusión de puntuaciones se puede ver como el procedimiento de encontrar K transformaciones ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K de manera que eSki se pueda utilizar para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma un subgrafo, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas). El párrafo puede formularse como min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 como el foro de referencia y por lo tanto ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que puede establecerse heurísticamente según el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro no de referencia. Cuanto más revisores haya, más popular será la foto y mayor debería ser el peso correspondiente ¯wk i. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk i y simplemente los establecemos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk i, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea mencionada anteriormente. La Comunidad Web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web enlazados son en realidad el mismo. El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., K), el cual tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo a ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la Ecuación 1, se realiza la suma en todas las líneas punteadas rojas. Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en la Sección 2.2, que servirá como base para el trabajo siguiente. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método ajustado manualmente en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso impráctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar de manera precisa fotos duplicadas entre foros web. Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: Fusión lineal y Fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5. Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algunos otros trabajos relacionados. 2.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones Dado que los diferentes foros web (de fotos) en la web suelen tener diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión. Además, dado que existen muchos tipos de calificaciones, como calificaciones para novedad, calificaciones para estética, etc., es razonable elegir una común, como la puntuación total o la puntuación promedio, que siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calcular a partir de las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el método de normalización en la puntuación total o puntuación promedio sea visto como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar las puntuaciones promedio mediante su transformación lineal a un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntuación como Puntuación Media Escalada. La dificultad, sin embargo, de utilizar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que la puntuación promedio para el objeto sea manipulada o sesgada. La puntuación total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como la calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema radica en cómo normalizar las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros web. La forma más sencilla puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas. La desventaja de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos. Para hacer que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%. Aquí, la puntuación modal representa la puntuación total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total. Y El puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de las imágenes tiene un puntaje total más bajo. Este método de normalización utiliza la moda y el percentil 90 como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo en diferentes foros de fotografía, es que aunque las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar considerablemente y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad intermedia (desde la moda hasta el percentil 90) debería ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (rigurosidad) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel intermedio en un foro web suelen ocupar más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un análisis más detallado de las puntuaciones en la Sección 3.2. 2.3 Fusión Manual El foro de películas en la web, IMDB [16], propuso utilizar una función de clasificación bayesiana para normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación dentro de una comunidad. Motivados por esta función de clasificación, proponemos este método de fusión manual: Para el k-ésimo sitio web, utilizamos la siguiente fórmula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) para clasificar fotos, donde nk es el número de votos y n∗ k, S∗ k y αk son tres parámetros. Esta función de clasificación primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuación media original ¯Ski y una puntuación de referencia S∗ k para obtener una puntuación media ponderada que puede ser más confiable que ¯Ski. Entonces, la puntuación media ponderada se escala por αk para obtener la puntuación final fSki. Para n comunidades web, hay aproximadamente 3n parámetros en {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} para ajustar. Aunque este método puede lograr resultados bastante buenos después de ajustes manuales cuidadosos y exhaustivos en estos parámetros, cuando n se vuelve cada vez más grande, por ejemplo, si hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web rastreadas e indexadas, este método se volverá cada vez más laborioso y eventualmente se volverá impracticable. Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un método de fusión efectivo cuyos parámetros puedan determinarse automáticamente. 2.4 Detección de Fotos Duplicadas Utilizamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo eficiente y efectivo de detección de imágenes duplicadas, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre cualquier par de foros de fotos. Este algoritmo utiliza una función hash para mapear una característica de alta dimensión a un código hash de 32 bits (ver abajo para cómo construir el código hash). La complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imágenes duplicadas entre n imágenes es aproximadamente O(n log n). La característica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrículas regulares de k × k. Basándose en todas las características extraídas de la base de datos de imágenes, se construye un modelo de PCA. Las características visuales son luego transformadas a un espacio PCA de baja dimensionalidad y media cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema. Entonces, el código hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensión se transforma en uno si el valor en esta dimensión es mayor que 0, y en 0 en caso contrario. Las fotos en el mismo grupo se consideran posibles duplicados y se filtran aún más por un umbral en términos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de características visuales. La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde se extraen características visuales - valores de gris promedio - en cuadrículas de 6 × 6 y 7 × 7. Las características de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el código hash se genera de acuerdo a los signos. Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la detección de fotos duplicadas. 2.5 Fusión de Puntuaciones En esta sección, presentaremos dos soluciones sobre la fusión de puntuaciones basadas en diferentes suposiciones de forma paramétrica de ψk en la Ecuación 1. 2.5.1 Fusión Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas. Intuitivamente, la forma más directa de eliminar las incertidumbres causadas por los diferentes criterios es escalar, relativo a un centro dado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foto de foro web no referenciada con respecto al foro de referencia. Más estrictamente, asumimos que ψk tiene la siguiente forma ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones del foro k(= 1) deben escalarse por αk en relación al centro tk 1−αk, como se muestra en la Figura 3. Entonces, si sustituimos ψk anterior en la Ec. 1, obtenemos la siguiente función objetivo, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K donde f es la función objetivo definida en la Ec. 5, obtenemos la solución en forma cerrada como: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) donde Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un método de fusión lineal. Disfruta de la simplicidad y el excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos. Figura 3: Método de Fusión Lineal 2.5.2 Fusión No Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas A veces queremos un método que pueda ajustar puntuaciones en intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios. Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el método puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] dejando las puntuaciones C0 y C1 sin cambios. Este tipo de método de fusión es mucho más refinado que los lineales y contiene muchos más parámetros para ajustar y se espera que mejore aún más los resultados. Aquí proponemos una solución de fusión no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones. Primero, introducimos una transformación: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, si x ∈ (c0, c1] x en otro caso donde α > 0. Esta transformación satisface que para x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] con ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 y ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1. Luego podemos utilizar esta transformación no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figura 4: Método de fusión no lineal. Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento. Aunque no hay una solución en forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimización, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2, no es difícil obtener la solución numérica. Bajo las mismas suposiciones hechas en la Sección 2.2, podemos utilizar este método para ajustar las puntuaciones de nivel intermedio (desde el punto de la moda hasta el percentil 90). Se espera que este método de fusión no lineal más complicado logre mejores resultados que el lineal. Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parámetros de manera exhaustiva. Los experimentos actuales en la Sección 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple. 2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de fusión Dado que nuestra función objetivo es hacer que las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro no referencial y el foro de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible, es natural investigar qué tan cerca llegan a estar entre sí y cómo cambian las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web entre los dos foros no referenciales antes y después de la fusión de puntuaciones. Tomando la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la Comunidad Web 1) y un foro no de referencia, lo que corresponde a minimizar la función objetivo en los enlaces rojos discontinuos (ocultos). Después de la optimización, debemos preguntarnos qué sucede con las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros no de referencia. O, en otras palabras, ¿se vuelven más consistentes las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces verdes discontinuos (ocultos)? Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de rendimiento δ para cuantificar los cambios en las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web como δkl = Sim(Slk, Skl) - Sim(Slk ∗, Skl ∗) (10) donde Skl = (Skl 1, ..., Skl Ikl)T, Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1, ..., eSkl Ikl)T y Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b||. δkl > 0 significa que después de la fusión de puntuaciones, las puntuaciones en los mismos objetos web entre el k-ésimo y el l-ésimo foro web se vuelven más consistentes, lo cual es lo que esperamos. Por el contrario, si δkl < 0, esas puntuaciones se vuelven más inconsistentes. Aunque no podemos depender de esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusión, ya que clasificar fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificación intermedios y proporcionar información sobre el rendimiento final de diferentes métodos de clasificación. 2.6 Contrastes con Otros Trabajos Relacionados Ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los métodos propuestos con los métodos tradicionales, como PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y los algoritmos de LinkFusion [27] en la Sección 1. Aquí discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas. El problema actual también puede ser visto como un problema de agregación de rangos [13, 14] ya que tratamos con la cuestión de cómo combinar varias listas de rangos. Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos. En primer lugar, a diferencia de las páginas web, que pueden ser detectadas fácil y precisamente como las mismas páginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados con cierta precisión y recuperación. Segundo, los números de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeños en comparación con el total de conjuntos de fotos (ver Tabla 1). En otras palabras, las listas de clasificación de los K mejores de diferentes foros web son casi disjuntas para una consulta dada. Bajo esta condición, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como sus medidas - distancia de Kendall tau o distancia de la regla de Spearman - degenerarán en algunos casos triviales. Otra categoría de métodos de fusión de rangos (agregación) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automático, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12]. Todos estos métodos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo. En la configuración actual, es difícil o incluso imposible etiquetar estos conjuntos de datos según su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para clasificar. En cambio, el problema aquí es cómo combinar varias sub listas ordenadas para formar una lista de orden total. 3. EXPERIMENTOS En esta sección, llevamos a cabo nuestra investigación sobre la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. Primero presentamos brevemente el nuevo motor de búsqueda de imágenes verticales propuesto - EnjoyPhoto en la sección 3.1. Luego nos enfocamos en cómo clasificar fotos de diferentes foros web. Para hacerlo, primero normalizamos las puntuaciones (calificaciones) de las fotos de diferentes foros web múltiples en la sección 3.2. Luego intentamos encontrar fotos duplicadas en la sección 3.3. Algunos resultados intermedios se discuten utilizando la medida δ en la sección 3.4. Finalmente se lleva a cabo un conjunto de estudios de usuarios cuidadosamente para justificar nuestro método propuesto en la sección 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: Motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad Para cumplir con el requisito de los usuarios de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, proponemos y construimos un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad - EnjoyPhoto, que aborda los siguientes tres problemas clave: 1. cómo rastrear e indexar fotos, 2. cómo determinar las cualidades de cada foto y 3. cómo mostrar los resultados de búsqueda para hacer que el proceso de búsqueda sea agradable. Para una consulta de texto dada, este sistema clasifica las fotos basándose en una cierta combinación de la relevancia de la foto para esta consulta (Problema 1) y la calidad de la foto (Problema 2), y finalmente las muestra de una manera agradable (Problema 3). En cuanto al tema 3, diseñamos la interfaz del sistema deliberadamente para facilitar el proceso de los usuarios al disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Técnicas como Fisheye y presentación de diapositivas son utilizadas en el sistema actual. La Figura 5 muestra la interfaz. No hablaremos más sobre este tema ya que no es un énfasis de este documento. Figura 5: EnjoyPhoto: un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad y agradable, donde se devuelven 26,477 registros para la consulta de otoño en aproximadamente 0.421 segundos. En cuanto al tema 1, extraímos de un motor de búsqueda comercial un subconjunto de fotos procedentes de varios foros de fotos de todo el mundo, y analizamos explícitamente las páginas web que contienen estas fotos. El número de fotos en la colección de datos es de aproximadamente 2.5 millones. Después del análisis, cada foto se asoció con su título, categoría, descripción, configuración de la cámara, datos EXIF 1 (cuando estuvieran disponibles para imágenes digitales), ubicación (cuando estuviera disponible en algunos foros de fotografía) y varios tipos de calificaciones. Todos estos metadatos son generalmente descripciones precisas o anotaciones para el contenido de la imagen, que luego son indexadas por tecnologías de búsqueda basadas en texto general [9, 18, 11]. En el sistema actual, la función de clasificación fue ajustada específicamente para enfatizar la información de título, categorización y calificación. El tema 2 se aborda esencialmente en las siguientes secciones, las cuales determinan la calidad de las fotos mediante el análisis de las calificaciones proporcionadas por varios foros de fotos en la web. Aquí elegimos seis foros de fotos para estudiar el problema de clasificación y los denominamos como Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E y Web-F. 3.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones de Fotos Se analizan detalladamente diferentes métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en esta sección. En este análisis, las cámaras digitales zero 1 guardan archivos JPEG (.jpg) con datos EXIF (Exchangeable Image File). La configuración de la cámara y la información de la escena son registradas por la cámara en el archivo de imagen. www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 6: Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones medias normalizadas a [0, 10] que suelen ocupar aproximadamente el 30% del número total de fotos en algunos foros web no se tienen en cuenta actualmente. Cómo utilizar estas fotos queda para futuras exploraciones. En la Figura 6, enumeramos las distribuciones de la puntuación media, la cual está transformada a un intervalo fijo [0, 10]. Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones promedio de estos foros web lucen bastante diferentes. Las distribuciones en las Figuras 6(a), 6(b) y 6(e) parecen distribuciones gaussianas, mientras que las de las Figuras 6(d) y 6(f) están dominadas por la puntuación más alta. La razón de estas distribuciones excéntricas para Web-D y Web-F radica en sus sistemas de calificación groseros. De hecho, Web-D y Web-F utilizan escalas de valoración de 2 o 3 puntos, mientras que otros foros web utilizan escalas de valoración de 7 u 14 puntos. Por lo tanto, será problemático si usamos directamente estos puntajes promediados. Además, es muy probable que la puntuación promedio sea manipulada si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando una foto. La Figura 7 muestra el método de normalización de puntuación total por puntajes máximos y mínimos, que es uno de nuestros sistemas de referencia. Todos los puntajes totales de un foro web dado se normalizan a [0, 100] de acuerdo con el puntaje máximo y mínimo del foro web correspondiente. Observamos que la distribución total de puntuaciones de Web-A en la Figura 7(a) tiene dos colas más grandes que todas las demás. Para mostrar la forma de las distribuciones de manera más clara, solo mostramos las distribuciones en [0, 25] en la Figura 7(b), 7(c), 7(d), 7(e) y 7(f). La Figura 8 muestra el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%, donde los modos de las seis distribuciones se normalizan a 5 y el percentil 90% a 8. Podemos ver que este método de normalización hace que las distribuciones de las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. Los dos algoritmos propuestos se basan en estos métodos de normalización. 3.3 Detección de fotos duplicadas. Dirigido a la eficiencia computacional, el algoritmo Dedup puede perder cierta tasa de recuperación, pero lograr una alta tasa de precisión. También nos enfocamos en encontrar enlaces ocultos precisos en lugar de todos los enlaces ocultos. La Figura 9 muestra algunos ejemplos de detección de duplicados. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 y verifican que existen grandes cantidades de fotos duplicadas en cualquier par de foros web, incluso con la estricta condición para la Deduplicación donde elegimos los primeros 29 bits como el código hash. Dado que solo hay unos pocos parámetros para estimar en los métodos de fusión propuestos, los números de fotos duplicadas mostrados en la Tabla 1 son 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 7: Normalización Maxmin 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 8: Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90% suficiente para determinar estos parámetros. La última columna de la tabla lista el número total de fotos en los foros web correspondientes. 3.4 δ Medida Los parámetros de los algoritmos lineales y no lineales propuestos se calculan utilizando los datos duplicados mostrados en la Tabla 1, donde se elige Web-C como el foro web de referencia ya que comparte la mayoría de las fotos duplicadas con otros foros. Las tablas 2 y 3 muestran la medida δ en el modelo lineal y el modelo no lineal. Dado que δkl es simétrico y δkk = 0, solo mostramos la parte triangular superior. Los valores NaN en ambas tablas se encuentran en que no se han detectado fotos duplicadas por el algoritmo Dedup, como se informa en la Tabla 1. El modelo lineal garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la Tabla 1: Número de fotos duplicadas entre cada par de foros web A B C D E F Escala A 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k B 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675k C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D 178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155k E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448k F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122k 383 Figura 9: Algunos resultados de la detección de fotos duplicadas Tabla 2: Medida δ en el modelo lineal. La comunidad de referencia debería ser teóricamente no menor a 0. Es, de hecho, el caso (ver los números subrayados en la Tabla 2). Pero este modelo no puede garantizar que las medidas de δ en las comunidades no referenciales también sean iguales o superiores a 0, ya que los pasos de normalización se basan en fotos duplicadas entre la comunidad de referencia y una comunidad no referencial. Los resultados muestran que todos los números en la medida δ son mayores que 0 (ver todos los números no subrayados en la Tabla 2), lo cual indica que es probable que este modelo dé resultados óptimos. Por el contrario, el modelo no lineal no garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la comunidad de referencia deban ser no inferiores a 0, ya que no todas las fotos duplicadas entre los dos foros web pueden ser utilizadas al optimizar este modelo. De hecho, las fotos duplicadas que se encuentran en intervalos diferentes no serán utilizadas en este modelo. Son estas fotos duplicadas específicas las que hacen que la medida δ sea negativa. Como resultado, hay tanto elementos negativos como positivos en la Tabla 3, pero en general el número de positivos es mayor que el de negativos (9:5), lo que indica que el modelo puede ser mejor que el método de normalización únicamente (ver siguiente subsección) que tiene una medida δ completamente nula, y peor que el modelo lineal. 3.5 Estudio de Usuario Debido a que es difícil encontrar un criterio objetivo para evaluar la Tabla 3: medida δ en el modelo no lineal. Web-B Web-C Web-D Web-E Web-F Web-A 0.0559 0.0054 -0.0185 -0.0054 NaN Web-B - -0.0162 -0.0345 -0.0301 0.0466 Web-C - - 0.0136 0.0071 0.1264 Web-D - - - 0.0032 0.0143 Web-E - - - - 0.214 qué función de clasificación es mejor, optamos por realizar estudios de usuario para evaluaciones subjetivas. Diez sujetos fueron invitados a participar en el estudio de usuarios. Fueron reclutados de universidades cercanas. Dado que los motores de búsqueda de búsqueda de texto y búsqueda de imágenes son familiares para los estudiantes universitarios, no había un criterio previo para elegir a los estudiantes. Realizamos estudios de usuarios utilizando Internet Explorer 6.0 en Windows XP con monitores LCD de 17 pulgadas configurados en 1,280 píxeles por 1,024 píxeles en color de 32 bits. Los datos fueron registrados con registros del servidor y encuestas en papel después de cada tarea. Figura 10: Interfaz del estudio de usuario. Específicamente diseñamos una interfaz para el estudio de usuario como se muestra en la Figura 10. Para cada par de métodos de fusión, se alentó a los participantes a probar cualquier consulta que desearan. Para aquellos sin ideas específicas, se enumeraron dos cuadros combinados (lista de categorías y lista de consultas) en el panel inferior, donde se proporcionaron las 1,000 <br>consultas de búsqueda de imágenes</br> principales de un motor de búsqueda comercial. Después de que un participante envió una consulta, el sistema seleccionó aleatoriamente el marco izquierdo o derecho para mostrar cada uno de los dos resultados de clasificación. Los participantes debían luego juzgar cuál de los dos resultados de clasificación era mejor, o si los dos resultados de clasificación tenían la misma calidad, y enviar el juicio eligiendo el botón de radio correspondiente y haciendo clic en el botón de enviar. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 10, se envía la consulta \"sunset\" al sistema. Entonces, 79,092 fotos fueron devueltas y clasificadas por el método de fusión Minmax en el marco izquierdo y el método de fusión lineal en el marco derecho. Un participante luego compara los dos resultados de clasificación (sin conocer los métodos de clasificación) y envía sus comentarios eligiendo respuestas en la opción Tuya. Tabla 4: Resultados del estudio de usuario Norm. Solo Manual Lineal Lineal 29:13:10 14:22:15 No lineal 29:15:9 12:27:12 6:4:45 La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados experimentales, donde Lineal denota el método de fusión lineal, No lineal denota el método de fusión no lineal, Norm. Solo significa el método de normalización Maxmin, Manualmente significa el método ajustado manualmente. Los tres números en cada ítem, por ejemplo 29:13:10, significan que 29 juicios prefieren los resultados de fusión lineal, 10 384 juicios prefieren el método de normalización solamente, y 13 juicios consideran que estos dos métodos son equivalentes. Realizamos el análisis de ANOVA y obtenemos las siguientes conclusiones: 1. Tanto los métodos lineales como no lineales son significativamente mejores que la Norma. El único método con valores P respectivos de 0.00165 (< 0.05) y 0.00073 (<< 0.05). Este resultado es consistente con el resultado de la evaluación de la medida δ. La norma. El único método asume que las 10% mejores fotos en diferentes foros tienen la misma calidad. Sin embargo, esta suposición no se sostiene en general. Por ejemplo, una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de primer nivel generalmente tiene una calidad superior a una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de segundo nivel. Esto es similar a eso, los estudiantes del 10% superior en una universidad de primer nivel y los de una universidad de segundo nivel suelen ser de diferente calidad. Tanto los métodos de fusión lineal como no lineal reconocen la existencia de tales diferencias y buscan cuantificarlas. Por lo tanto, ellos se desempeñan mejor que la norma. Único método. 2. El método de fusión lineal es significativamente mejor que el no lineal con un valor P de 1.195 × 10−10. Este resultado es bastante sorprendente ya que se espera que este método de clasificación más complicado ajuste la clasificación de manera más precisa que el lineal. La razón principal de este resultado puede ser que es difícil encontrar los mejores intervalos donde se debe llevar a cabo el ajuste no lineal y, sin embargo, simplemente se eligió la parte central del método de Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90%. Los métodos de evaluación que consumen mucho tiempo y son subjetivos - estudios de usuario - nos impidieron ajustar extensamente estos parámetros. 3. Los métodos lineales y no lineales propuestos tienen un rendimiento casi igual o ligeramente mejor que el método ajustado manualmente. Dado que los métodos de fusión lineal/no lineal son enfoques completamente automáticos, se consideran soluciones prácticas y eficientes cuando se necesite integrar más comunidades (por ejemplo, docenas de comunidades). 4. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJO FUTURO En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web en los casos de falta de relaciones entre objetos donde los algoritmos de clasificación tradicionales ya no son válidos, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. Hemos construido un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical de alta calidad y propuesto métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas fuentes de datos (foros web) como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por el algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son una solución práctica y eficiente para la clasificación de objetos web en las relaciones mencionadas. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros tipos de objetos web, incluyendo videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, música, dibujos, esculturas, y así sucesivamente. El sistema actual está lejos de ser perfecto. Para hacer este sistema más efectivo, se necesitan análisis más delicados para el dominio vertical (por ejemplo, foros de fotos en la web). Los siguientes puntos, por ejemplo, pueden mejorar los resultados de búsqueda y serán nuestro trabajo futuro: 1. un análisis más sutil y luego la utilización de diferentes tipos de calificaciones (por ejemplo, calificaciones de novedad, calificaciones estéticas); 2. diferenciar diversas comunidades que pueden tener diferentes intereses y preferencias o incluso entendimientos culturales distintos; 3. incorporar más información útil, incluida la información de fotógrafos y revisores, para modelar las fotos en un espacio de datos heterogéneo en lugar del actual homogéneo. Utilizaremos aún más el filtrado colaborativo para recomendar fotos relevantes de alta calidad a los navegadores. Un problema abierto es si podemos encontrar un criterio objetivo y eficiente para evaluar los resultados de clasificación, en lugar de emplear estudios de usuario subjetivos e ineficientes, que nos impidieron probar más algoritmos de clasificación y ajustar parámetros en un algoritmo.

                "49, Zhichun Road Haidian District, Beijing, 100080, P R China ABSTRACT Vertical search is a promising direction as it leverages domainspecific knowledge and can provide more precise information for users.",
                "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.",
                "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval; G.2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory; H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services - Web-based services General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to <br>rank photo</br>s coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
                "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to <br>rank photo</br>s from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to <br>rank photo</br>s, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K.

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",

                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",

                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",

                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",

                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información; G.2.2 [Matemáticas Discretas]: Teoría de Grafos; H.3.5 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Servicios de Información en Línea - Servicios basados en la web Términos Generales Algoritmos, Experimentación 1. A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial <br>clasificar las fotos</br> provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de objetos web en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo <br>clasificar fotos</br> de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2. ALGORITMO 2.1 Resumen La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web radica en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente existen dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros utilizan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros utilizan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o de 10 puntos. Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero un análisis detallado de los datos y experimentos muestra que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, la misma puntuación no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. De manera intuitiva, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos establecer relaciones entre cualquier par de foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante la normalización y transformación de puntuaciones. Afortunadamente, descubrimos que existe un buen número de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos en la web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de obtener una amplia difusión. En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente de detección de fotos duplicadas [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Ante la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se requiere un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como el foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas deberían ser iguales aunque estén en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes foros, excepto en el foro de referencia, pueden variar en un espacio paramétrico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntuación. Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer que las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas en foros no de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible a las del foro de referencia, podemos resolver eficazmente el problema de clasificación. Para mayor comodidad, se emplean las siguientes notaciones. Ski y ¯Ski denotan la puntuación total y la puntuación media del i-ésimo objeto web (foto) en el k-ésimo sitio web, respectivamente. La puntuación total se refiere a la suma de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación (por ejemplo, la puntuación de novedad y la puntuación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Además, utilizamos {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} para denotar el conjunto de puntuaciones de objetos web (fotos) en los foros web k-ésimos que son duplicados con los foros web l-ésimos, donde Ikl es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusión de puntuaciones se puede ver como el procedimiento de encontrar K transformaciones ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K de manera que eSki se pueda utilizar para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma un subgrafo, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas). El párrafo puede formularse como min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 como el foro de referencia y por lo tanto ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que puede establecerse heurísticamente según el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro no de referencia. Cuanto más revisores haya, más popular será la foto y mayor debería ser el peso correspondiente ¯wk i. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk i y simplemente los establecemos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk i, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea mencionada anteriormente. La Comunidad Web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web enlazados son en realidad el mismo. El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., K), el cual tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo a ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la Ecuación 1, se realiza la suma en todas las líneas punteadas rojas. Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en la Sección 2.2, que servirá como base para el trabajo siguiente. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método ajustado manualmente en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso impráctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar de manera precisa fotos duplicadas entre foros web. Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: Fusión lineal y Fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5. Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algunos otros trabajos relacionados. 2.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones Dado que los diferentes foros web (de fotos) en la web suelen tener diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión. Además, dado que existen muchos tipos de calificaciones, como calificaciones para novedad, calificaciones para estética, etc., es razonable elegir una común, como la puntuación total o la puntuación promedio, que siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calcular a partir de las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el método de normalización en la puntuación total o puntuación promedio sea visto como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar las puntuaciones promedio mediante su transformación lineal a un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntuación como Puntuación Media Escalada. La dificultad, sin embargo, de utilizar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que la puntuación promedio para el objeto sea manipulada o sesgada. La puntuación total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como la calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema radica en cómo normalizar las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros web. La forma más sencilla puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas. La desventaja de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos. Para hacer que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%. Aquí, la puntuación modal representa la puntuación total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total. Y El puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de las imágenes tiene un puntaje total más bajo. Este método de normalización utiliza la moda y el percentil 90 como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo en diferentes foros de fotografía, es que aunque las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar considerablemente y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad intermedia (desde la moda hasta el percentil 90) debería ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (rigurosidad) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel intermedio en un foro web suelen ocupar más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un análisis más detallado de las puntuaciones en la Sección 3.2. 2.3 Fusión Manual El foro de películas en la web, IMDB [16], propuso utilizar una función de clasificación bayesiana para normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación dentro de una comunidad. Motivados por esta función de clasificación, proponemos este método de fusión manual: Para el k-ésimo sitio web, utilizamos la siguiente fórmula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) para <br>clasificar fotos</br>, donde nk es el número de votos y n∗ k, S∗ k y αk son tres parámetros. Esta función de clasificación primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuación media original ¯Ski y una puntuación de referencia S∗ k para obtener una puntuación media ponderada que puede ser más confiable que ¯Ski. Entonces, la puntuación media ponderada se escala por αk para obtener la puntuación final fSki. Para n comunidades web, hay aproximadamente 3n parámetros en {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} para ajustar. Aunque este método puede lograr resultados bastante buenos después de ajustes manuales cuidadosos y exhaustivos en estos parámetros, cuando n se vuelve cada vez más grande, por ejemplo, si hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web rastreadas e indexadas, este método se volverá cada vez más laborioso y eventualmente se volverá impracticable. Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un método de fusión efectivo cuyos parámetros puedan determinarse automáticamente. 2.4 Detección de Fotos Duplicadas Utilizamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo eficiente y efectivo de detección de imágenes duplicadas, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre cualquier par de foros de fotos. Este algoritmo utiliza una función hash para mapear una característica de alta dimensión a un código hash de 32 bits (ver abajo para cómo construir el código hash). La complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imágenes duplicadas entre n imágenes es aproximadamente O(n log n). La característica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrículas regulares de k × k. Basándose en todas las características extraídas de la base de datos de imágenes, se construye un modelo de PCA. Las características visuales son luego transformadas a un espacio PCA de baja dimensionalidad y media cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema. Entonces, el código hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensión se transforma en uno si el valor en esta dimensión es mayor que 0, y en 0 en caso contrario. Las fotos en el mismo grupo se consideran posibles duplicados y se filtran aún más por un umbral en términos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de características visuales. La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde se extraen características visuales - valores de gris promedio - en cuadrículas de 6 × 6 y 7 × 7. Las características de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el código hash se genera de acuerdo a los signos. Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la detección de fotos duplicadas. 2.5 Fusión de Puntuaciones En esta sección, presentaremos dos soluciones sobre la fusión de puntuaciones basadas en diferentes suposiciones de forma paramétrica de ψk en la Ecuación 1. 2.5.1 Fusión Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas. Intuitivamente, la forma más directa de eliminar las incertidumbres causadas por los diferentes criterios es escalar, relativo a un centro dado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foto de foro web no referenciada con respecto al foro de referencia. Más estrictamente, asumimos que ψk tiene la siguiente forma ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones del foro k(= 1) deben escalarse por αk en relación al centro tk 1−αk, como se muestra en la Figura 3. Entonces, si sustituimos ψk anterior en la Ec. 1, obtenemos la siguiente función objetivo, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K donde f es la función objetivo definida en la Ec. 5, obtenemos la solución en forma cerrada como: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) donde Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un método de fusión lineal. Disfruta de la simplicidad y el excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos. Figura 3: Método de Fusión Lineal 2.5.2 Fusión No Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas A veces queremos un método que pueda ajustar puntuaciones en intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios. Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el método puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] dejando las puntuaciones C0 y C1 sin cambios. Este tipo de método de fusión es mucho más refinado que los lineales y contiene muchos más parámetros para ajustar y se espera que mejore aún más los resultados. Aquí proponemos una solución de fusión no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones. Primero, introducimos una transformación: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, si x ∈ (c0, c1] x en otro caso donde α > 0. Esta transformación satisface que para x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] con ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 y ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1. Luego podemos utilizar esta transformación no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figura 4: Método de fusión no lineal. Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento. Aunque no hay una solución en forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimización, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2, no es difícil obtener la solución numérica. Bajo las mismas suposiciones hechas en la Sección 2.2, podemos utilizar este método para ajustar las puntuaciones de nivel intermedio (desde el punto de la moda hasta el percentil 90). Se espera que este método de fusión no lineal más complicado logre mejores resultados que el lineal. Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parámetros de manera exhaustiva. Los experimentos actuales en la Sección 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple. 2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de fusión Dado que nuestra función objetivo es hacer que las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro no referencial y el foro de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible, es natural investigar qué tan cerca llegan a estar entre sí y cómo cambian las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web entre los dos foros no referenciales antes y después de la fusión de puntuaciones. Tomando la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la Comunidad Web 1) y un foro no de referencia, lo que corresponde a minimizar la función objetivo en los enlaces rojos discontinuos (ocultos). Después de la optimización, debemos preguntarnos qué sucede con las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros no de referencia. O, en otras palabras, ¿se vuelven más consistentes las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces verdes discontinuos (ocultos)? Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de rendimiento δ para cuantificar los cambios en las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web como δkl = Sim(Slk, Skl) - Sim(Slk ∗, Skl ∗) (10) donde Skl = (Skl 1, ..., Skl Ikl)T, Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1, ..., eSkl Ikl)T y Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b||. δkl > 0 significa que después de la fusión de puntuaciones, las puntuaciones en los mismos objetos web entre el k-ésimo y el l-ésimo foro web se vuelven más consistentes, lo cual es lo que esperamos. Por el contrario, si δkl < 0, esas puntuaciones se vuelven más inconsistentes. Aunque no podemos depender de esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusión, ya que clasificar fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificación intermedios y proporcionar información sobre el rendimiento final de diferentes métodos de clasificación. 2.6 Contrastes con Otros Trabajos Relacionados Ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los métodos propuestos con los métodos tradicionales, como PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y los algoritmos de LinkFusion [27] en la Sección 1. Aquí discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas. El problema actual también puede ser visto como un problema de agregación de rangos [13, 14] ya que tratamos con la cuestión de cómo combinar varias listas de rangos. Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos. En primer lugar, a diferencia de las páginas web, que pueden ser detectadas fácil y precisamente como las mismas páginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados con cierta precisión y recuperación. Segundo, los números de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeños en comparación con el total de conjuntos de fotos (ver Tabla 1). En otras palabras, las listas de clasificación de los K mejores de diferentes foros web son casi disjuntas para una consulta dada. Bajo esta condición, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como sus medidas - distancia de Kendall tau o distancia de la regla de Spearman - degenerarán en algunos casos triviales. Otra categoría de métodos de fusión de rangos (agregación) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automático, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12]. Todos estos métodos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo. En la configuración actual, es difícil o incluso imposible etiquetar estos conjuntos de datos según su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para clasificar. En cambio, el problema aquí es cómo combinar varias sub listas ordenadas para formar una lista de orden total. 3. EXPERIMENTOS En esta sección, llevamos a cabo nuestra investigación sobre la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. Primero presentamos brevemente el nuevo motor de búsqueda de imágenes verticales propuesto - EnjoyPhoto en la sección 3.1. Luego nos enfocamos en cómo <br>clasificar fotos</br> de diferentes foros web. Para hacerlo, primero normalizamos las puntuaciones (calificaciones) de las fotos de diferentes foros web múltiples en la sección 3.2. Luego intentamos encontrar fotos duplicadas en la sección 3.3. Algunos resultados intermedios se discuten utilizando la medida δ en la sección 3.4. Finalmente se lleva a cabo un conjunto de estudios de usuarios cuidadosamente para justificar nuestro método propuesto en la sección 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: Motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad Para cumplir con el requisito de los usuarios de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, proponemos y construimos un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad - EnjoyPhoto, que aborda los siguientes tres problemas clave: 1. cómo rastrear e indexar fotos, 2. cómo determinar las cualidades de cada foto y 3. cómo mostrar los resultados de búsqueda para hacer que el proceso de búsqueda sea agradable. Para una consulta de texto dada, este sistema clasifica las fotos basándose en una cierta combinación de la relevancia de la foto para esta consulta (Problema 1) y la calidad de la foto (Problema 2), y finalmente las muestra de una manera agradable (Problema 3). En cuanto al tema 3, diseñamos la interfaz del sistema deliberadamente para facilitar el proceso de los usuarios al disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Técnicas como Fisheye y presentación de diapositivas son utilizadas en el sistema actual. La Figura 5 muestra la interfaz. No hablaremos más sobre este tema ya que no es un énfasis de este documento. Figura 5: EnjoyPhoto: un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad y agradable, donde se devuelven 26,477 registros para la consulta de otoño en aproximadamente 0.421 segundos. En cuanto al tema 1, extraímos de un motor de búsqueda comercial un subconjunto de fotos procedentes de varios foros de fotos de todo el mundo, y analizamos explícitamente las páginas web que contienen estas fotos. El número de fotos en la colección de datos es de aproximadamente 2.5 millones. Después del análisis, cada foto se asoció con su título, categoría, descripción, configuración de la cámara, datos EXIF 1 (cuando estuvieran disponibles para imágenes digitales), ubicación (cuando estuviera disponible en algunos foros de fotografía) y varios tipos de calificaciones. Todos estos metadatos son generalmente descripciones precisas o anotaciones para el contenido de la imagen, que luego son indexadas por tecnologías de búsqueda basadas en texto general [9, 18, 11]. En el sistema actual, la función de clasificación fue ajustada específicamente para enfatizar la información de título, categorización y calificación. El tema 2 se aborda esencialmente en las siguientes secciones, las cuales determinan la calidad de las fotos mediante el análisis de las calificaciones proporcionadas por varios foros de fotos en la web. Aquí elegimos seis foros de fotos para estudiar el problema de clasificación y los denominamos como Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E y Web-F. 3.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones de Fotos Se analizan detalladamente diferentes métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en esta sección. En este análisis, las cámaras digitales zero 1 guardan archivos JPEG (.jpg) con datos EXIF (Exchangeable Image File). La configuración de la cámara y la información de la escena son registradas por la cámara en el archivo de imagen. www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 6: Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones medias normalizadas a [0, 10] que suelen ocupar aproximadamente el 30% del número total de fotos en algunos foros web no se tienen en cuenta actualmente. Cómo utilizar estas fotos queda para futuras exploraciones. En la Figura 6, enumeramos las distribuciones de la puntuación media, la cual está transformada a un intervalo fijo [0, 10]. Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones promedio de estos foros web lucen bastante diferentes. Las distribuciones en las Figuras 6(a), 6(b) y 6(e) parecen distribuciones gaussianas, mientras que las de las Figuras 6(d) y 6(f) están dominadas por la puntuación más alta. La razón de estas distribuciones excéntricas para Web-D y Web-F radica en sus sistemas de calificación groseros. De hecho, Web-D y Web-F utilizan escalas de valoración de 2 o 3 puntos, mientras que otros foros web utilizan escalas de valoración de 7 u 14 puntos. Por lo tanto, será problemático si usamos directamente estos puntajes promediados. Además, es muy probable que la puntuación promedio sea manipulada si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando una foto. La Figura 7 muestra el método de normalización de puntuación total por puntajes máximos y mínimos, que es uno de nuestros sistemas de referencia. Todos los puntajes totales de un foro web dado se normalizan a [0, 100] de acuerdo con el puntaje máximo y mínimo del foro web correspondiente. Observamos que la distribución total de puntuaciones de Web-A en la Figura 7(a) tiene dos colas más grandes que todas las demás. Para mostrar la forma de las distribuciones de manera más clara, solo mostramos las distribuciones en [0, 25] en la Figura 7(b), 7(c), 7(d), 7(e) y 7(f). La Figura 8 muestra el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%, donde los modos de las seis distribuciones se normalizan a 5 y el percentil 90% a 8. Podemos ver que este método de normalización hace que las distribuciones de las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. Los dos algoritmos propuestos se basan en estos métodos de normalización. 3.3 Detección de fotos duplicadas. Dirigido a la eficiencia computacional, el algoritmo Dedup puede perder cierta tasa de recuperación, pero lograr una alta tasa de precisión. También nos enfocamos en encontrar enlaces ocultos precisos en lugar de todos los enlaces ocultos. La Figura 9 muestra algunos ejemplos de detección de duplicados. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 y verifican que existen grandes cantidades de fotos duplicadas en cualquier par de foros web, incluso con la estricta condición para la Deduplicación donde elegimos los primeros 29 bits como el código hash. Dado que solo hay unos pocos parámetros para estimar en los métodos de fusión propuestos, los números de fotos duplicadas mostrados en la Tabla 1 son 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 7: Normalización Maxmin 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 8: Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90% suficiente para determinar estos parámetros. La última columna de la tabla lista el número total de fotos en los foros web correspondientes. 3.4 δ Medida Los parámetros de los algoritmos lineales y no lineales propuestos se calculan utilizando los datos duplicados mostrados en la Tabla 1, donde se elige Web-C como el foro web de referencia ya que comparte la mayoría de las fotos duplicadas con otros foros. Las tablas 2 y 3 muestran la medida δ en el modelo lineal y el modelo no lineal. Dado que δkl es simétrico y δkk = 0, solo mostramos la parte triangular superior. Los valores NaN en ambas tablas se encuentran en que no se han detectado fotos duplicadas por el algoritmo Dedup, como se informa en la Tabla 1. El modelo lineal garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la Tabla 1: Número de fotos duplicadas entre cada par de foros web A B C D E F Escala A 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k B 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675k C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D 178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155k E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448k F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122k 383 Figura 9: Algunos resultados de la detección de fotos duplicadas Tabla 2: Medida δ en el modelo lineal. La comunidad de referencia debería ser teóricamente no menor a 0. Es, de hecho, el caso (ver los números subrayados en la Tabla 2). Pero este modelo no puede garantizar que las medidas de δ en las comunidades no referenciales también sean iguales o superiores a 0, ya que los pasos de normalización se basan en fotos duplicadas entre la comunidad de referencia y una comunidad no referencial. Los resultados muestran que todos los números en la medida δ son mayores que 0 (ver todos los números no subrayados en la Tabla 2), lo cual indica que es probable que este modelo dé resultados óptimos. Por el contrario, el modelo no lineal no garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la comunidad de referencia deban ser no inferiores a 0, ya que no todas las fotos duplicadas entre los dos foros web pueden ser utilizadas al optimizar este modelo. De hecho, las fotos duplicadas que se encuentran en intervalos diferentes no serán utilizadas en este modelo. Son estas fotos duplicadas específicas las que hacen que la medida δ sea negativa. Como resultado, hay tanto elementos negativos como positivos en la Tabla 3, pero en general el número de positivos es mayor que el de negativos (9:5), lo que indica que el modelo puede ser mejor que el método de normalización únicamente (ver siguiente subsección) que tiene una medida δ completamente nula, y peor que el modelo lineal. 3.5 Estudio de Usuario Debido a que es difícil encontrar un criterio objetivo para evaluar la Tabla 3: medida δ en el modelo no lineal. Web-B Web-C Web-D Web-E Web-F Web-A 0.0559 0.0054 -0.0185 -0.0054 NaN Web-B - -0.0162 -0.0345 -0.0301 0.0466 Web-C - - 0.0136 0.0071 0.1264 Web-D - - - 0.0032 0.0143 Web-E - - - - 0.214 qué función de clasificación es mejor, optamos por realizar estudios de usuario para evaluaciones subjetivas. Diez sujetos fueron invitados a participar en el estudio de usuarios. Fueron reclutados de universidades cercanas. Dado que los motores de búsqueda de búsqueda de texto y búsqueda de imágenes son familiares para los estudiantes universitarios, no había un criterio previo para elegir a los estudiantes. Realizamos estudios de usuarios utilizando Internet Explorer 6.0 en Windows XP con monitores LCD de 17 pulgadas configurados en 1,280 píxeles por 1,024 píxeles en color de 32 bits. Los datos fueron registrados con registros del servidor y encuestas en papel después de cada tarea. Figura 10: Interfaz del estudio de usuario. Específicamente diseñamos una interfaz para el estudio de usuario como se muestra en la Figura 10. Para cada par de métodos de fusión, se alentó a los participantes a probar cualquier consulta que desearan. Para aquellos sin ideas específicas, se enumeraron dos cuadros combinados (lista de categorías y lista de consultas) en el panel inferior, donde se proporcionaron las 1,000 consultas de búsqueda de imágenes principales de un motor de búsqueda comercial. Después de que un participante envió una consulta, el sistema seleccionó aleatoriamente el marco izquierdo o derecho para mostrar cada uno de los dos resultados de clasificación. Los participantes debían luego juzgar cuál de los dos resultados de clasificación era mejor, o si los dos resultados de clasificación tenían la misma calidad, y enviar el juicio eligiendo el botón de radio correspondiente y haciendo clic en el botón de enviar. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 10, se envía la consulta \"sunset\" al sistema. Entonces, 79,092 fotos fueron devueltas y clasificadas por el método de fusión Minmax en el marco izquierdo y el método de fusión lineal en el marco derecho. Un participante luego compara los dos resultados de clasificación (sin conocer los métodos de clasificación) y envía sus comentarios eligiendo respuestas en la opción Tuya. Tabla 4: Resultados del estudio de usuario Norm. Solo Manual Lineal Lineal 29:13:10 14:22:15 No lineal 29:15:9 12:27:12 6:4:45 La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados experimentales, donde Lineal denota el método de fusión lineal, No lineal denota el método de fusión no lineal, Norm. Solo significa el método de normalización Maxmin, Manualmente significa el método ajustado manualmente. Los tres números en cada ítem, por ejemplo 29:13:10, significan que 29 juicios prefieren los resultados de fusión lineal, 10 384 juicios prefieren el método de normalización solamente, y 13 juicios consideran que estos dos métodos son equivalentes. Realizamos el análisis de ANOVA y obtenemos las siguientes conclusiones: 1. Tanto los métodos lineales como no lineales son significativamente mejores que la Norma. El único método con valores P respectivos de 0.00165 (< 0.05) y 0.00073 (<< 0.05). Este resultado es consistente con el resultado de la evaluación de la medida δ. La norma. El único método asume que las 10% mejores fotos en diferentes foros tienen la misma calidad. Sin embargo, esta suposición no se sostiene en general. Por ejemplo, una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de primer nivel generalmente tiene una calidad superior a una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de segundo nivel. Esto es similar a eso, los estudiantes del 10% superior en una universidad de primer nivel y los de una universidad de segundo nivel suelen ser de diferente calidad. Tanto los métodos de fusión lineal como no lineal reconocen la existencia de tales diferencias y buscan cuantificarlas. Por lo tanto, ellos se desempeñan mejor que la norma. Único método. 2. El método de fusión lineal es significativamente mejor que el no lineal con un valor P de 1.195 × 10−10. Este resultado es bastante sorprendente ya que se espera que este método de clasificación más complicado ajuste la clasificación de manera más precisa que el lineal. La razón principal de este resultado puede ser que es difícil encontrar los mejores intervalos donde se debe llevar a cabo el ajuste no lineal y, sin embargo, simplemente se eligió la parte central del método de Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90%. Los métodos de evaluación que consumen mucho tiempo y son subjetivos - estudios de usuario - nos impidieron ajustar extensamente estos parámetros. 3. Los métodos lineales y no lineales propuestos tienen un rendimiento casi igual o ligeramente mejor que el método ajustado manualmente. Dado que los métodos de fusión lineal/no lineal son enfoques completamente automáticos, se consideran soluciones prácticas y eficientes cuando se necesite integrar más comunidades (por ejemplo, docenas de comunidades). 4. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJO FUTURO En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web en los casos de falta de relaciones entre objetos donde los algoritmos de clasificación tradicionales ya no son válidos, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. Hemos construido un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical de alta calidad y propuesto métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas fuentes de datos (foros web) como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por el algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son una solución práctica y eficiente para la clasificación de objetos web en las relaciones mencionadas. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros tipos de objetos web, incluyendo videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, música, dibujos, esculturas, y así sucesivamente. El sistema actual está lejos de ser perfecto. Para hacer este sistema más efectivo, se necesitan análisis más delicados para el dominio vertical (por ejemplo, foros de fotos en la web). Los siguientes puntos, por ejemplo, pueden mejorar los resultados de búsqueda y serán nuestro trabajo futuro: 1. un análisis más sutil y luego la utilización de diferentes tipos de calificaciones (por ejemplo, calificaciones de novedad, calificaciones estéticas); 2. diferenciar diversas comunidades que pueden tener diferentes intereses y preferencias o incluso entendimientos culturales distintos; 3. incorporar más información útil, incluida la información de fotógrafos y revisores, para modelar las fotos en un espacio de datos heterogéneo en lugar del actual homogéneo. Utilizaremos aún más el filtrado colaborativo para recomendar fotos relevantes de alta calidad a los navegadores. Un problema abierto es si podemos encontrar un criterio objetivo y eficiente para evaluar los resultados de clasificación, en lugar de emplear estudios de usuario subjetivos e ineficientes, que nos impidieron probar más algoritmos de clasificación y ajustar parámetros en un algoritmo.

                "49, Zhichun Road Haidian District, Beijing, 100080, P R China ABSTRACT Vertical search is a promising direction as it leverages domainspecific knowledge and can provide more precise information for users.",
                "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.",
                "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval; G.2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory; H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services - Web-based services General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
                "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",

                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",

                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",

                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",

                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient <br>duplicate photo detection algorithm</br> [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K.

                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",

                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un <br>algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas</br>, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información; G.2.2 [Matemáticas Discretas]: Teoría de Grafos; H.3.5 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Servicios de Información en Línea - Servicios basados en la web Términos Generales Algoritmos, Experimentación 1. A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de objetos web en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2. ALGORITMO 2.1 Resumen La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web radica en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente existen dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros utilizan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros utilizan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o de 10 puntos. Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero un análisis detallado de los datos y experimentos muestra que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, la misma puntuación no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. De manera intuitiva, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos establecer relaciones entre cualquier par de foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante la normalización y transformación de puntuaciones. Afortunadamente, descubrimos que existe un buen número de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos en la web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de obtener una amplia difusión. En este trabajo, adoptamos un <br>algoritmo eficiente de detección de fotos duplicadas</br> [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Ante la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se requiere un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como el foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas deberían ser iguales aunque estén en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes foros, excepto en el foro de referencia, pueden variar en un espacio paramétrico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntuación. Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer que las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas en foros no de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible a las del foro de referencia, podemos resolver eficazmente el problema de clasificación. Para mayor comodidad, se emplean las siguientes notaciones. Ski y ¯Ski denotan la puntuación total y la puntuación media del i-ésimo objeto web (foto) en el k-ésimo sitio web, respectivamente. La puntuación total se refiere a la suma de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación (por ejemplo, la puntuación de novedad y la puntuación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Además, utilizamos {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} para denotar el conjunto de puntuaciones de objetos web (fotos) en los foros web k-ésimos que son duplicados con los foros web l-ésimos, donde Ikl es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusión de puntuaciones se puede ver como el procedimiento de encontrar K transformaciones ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K de manera que eSki se pueda utilizar para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma un subgrafo, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas). El párrafo puede formularse como min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 como el foro de referencia y por lo tanto ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que puede establecerse heurísticamente según el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro no de referencia. Cuanto más revisores haya, más popular será la foto y mayor debería ser el peso correspondiente ¯wk i. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk i y simplemente los establecemos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk i, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea mencionada anteriormente. La Comunidad Web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web enlazados son en realidad el mismo. El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., K), el cual tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo a ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la Ecuación 1, se realiza la suma en todas las líneas punteadas rojas. Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en la Sección 2.2, que servirá como base para el trabajo siguiente. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método ajustado manualmente en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso impráctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar de manera precisa fotos duplicadas entre foros web. Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: Fusión lineal y Fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5. Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algunos otros trabajos relacionados. 2.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones Dado que los diferentes foros web (de fotos) en la web suelen tener diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión. Además, dado que existen muchos tipos de calificaciones, como calificaciones para novedad, calificaciones para estética, etc., es razonable elegir una común, como la puntuación total o la puntuación promedio, que siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calcular a partir de las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el método de normalización en la puntuación total o puntuación promedio sea visto como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar las puntuaciones promedio mediante su transformación lineal a un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntuación como Puntuación Media Escalada. La dificultad, sin embargo, de utilizar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que la puntuación promedio para el objeto sea manipulada o sesgada. La puntuación total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como la calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema radica en cómo normalizar las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros web. La forma más sencilla puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas. La desventaja de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos. Para hacer que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%. Aquí, la puntuación modal representa la puntuación total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total. Y El puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de las imágenes tiene un puntaje total más bajo. Este método de normalización utiliza la moda y el percentil 90 como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo en diferentes foros de fotografía, es que aunque las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar considerablemente y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad intermedia (desde la moda hasta el percentil 90) debería ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (rigurosidad) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel intermedio en un foro web suelen ocupar más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un análisis más detallado de las puntuaciones en la Sección 3.2. 2.3 Fusión Manual El foro de películas en la web, IMDB [16], propuso utilizar una función de clasificación bayesiana para normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación dentro de una comunidad. Motivados por esta función de clasificación, proponemos este método de fusión manual: Para el k-ésimo sitio web, utilizamos la siguiente fórmula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) para clasificar fotos, donde nk es el número de votos y n∗ k, S∗ k y αk son tres parámetros. Esta función de clasificación primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuación media original ¯Ski y una puntuación de referencia S∗ k para obtener una puntuación media ponderada que puede ser más confiable que ¯Ski. Entonces, la puntuación media ponderada se escala por αk para obtener la puntuación final fSki. Para n comunidades web, hay aproximadamente 3n parámetros en {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} para ajustar. Aunque este método puede lograr resultados bastante buenos después de ajustes manuales cuidadosos y exhaustivos en estos parámetros, cuando n se vuelve cada vez más grande, por ejemplo, si hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web rastreadas e indexadas, este método se volverá cada vez más laborioso y eventualmente se volverá impracticable. Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un método de fusión efectivo cuyos parámetros puedan determinarse automáticamente. 2.4 Detección de Fotos Duplicadas Utilizamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo eficiente y efectivo de detección de imágenes duplicadas, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre cualquier par de foros de fotos. Este algoritmo utiliza una función hash para mapear una característica de alta dimensión a un código hash de 32 bits (ver abajo para cómo construir el código hash). La complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imágenes duplicadas entre n imágenes es aproximadamente O(n log n). La característica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrículas regulares de k × k. Basándose en todas las características extraídas de la base de datos de imágenes, se construye un modelo de PCA. Las características visuales son luego transformadas a un espacio PCA de baja dimensionalidad y media cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema. Entonces, el código hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensión se transforma en uno si el valor en esta dimensión es mayor que 0, y en 0 en caso contrario. Las fotos en el mismo grupo se consideran posibles duplicados y se filtran aún más por un umbral en términos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de características visuales. La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde se extraen características visuales - valores de gris promedio - en cuadrículas de 6 × 6 y 7 × 7. Las características de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el código hash se genera de acuerdo a los signos. Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la detección de fotos duplicadas. 2.5 Fusión de Puntuaciones En esta sección, presentaremos dos soluciones sobre la fusión de puntuaciones basadas en diferentes suposiciones de forma paramétrica de ψk en la Ecuación 1. 2.5.1 Fusión Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas. Intuitivamente, la forma más directa de eliminar las incertidumbres causadas por los diferentes criterios es escalar, relativo a un centro dado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foto de foro web no referenciada con respecto al foro de referencia. Más estrictamente, asumimos que ψk tiene la siguiente forma ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones del foro k(= 1) deben escalarse por αk en relación al centro tk 1−αk, como se muestra en la Figura 3. Entonces, si sustituimos ψk anterior en la Ec. 1, obtenemos la siguiente función objetivo, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K donde f es la función objetivo definida en la Ec. 5, obtenemos la solución en forma cerrada como: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) donde Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un método de fusión lineal. Disfruta de la simplicidad y el excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos. Figura 3: Método de Fusión Lineal 2.5.2 Fusión No Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas A veces queremos un método que pueda ajustar puntuaciones en intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios. Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el método puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] dejando las puntuaciones C0 y C1 sin cambios. Este tipo de método de fusión es mucho más refinado que los lineales y contiene muchos más parámetros para ajustar y se espera que mejore aún más los resultados. Aquí proponemos una solución de fusión no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones. Primero, introducimos una transformación: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, si x ∈ (c0, c1] x en otro caso donde α > 0. Esta transformación satisface que para x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] con ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 y ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1. Luego podemos utilizar esta transformación no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figura 4: Método de fusión no lineal. Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento. Aunque no hay una solución en forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimización, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2, no es difícil obtener la solución numérica. Bajo las mismas suposiciones hechas en la Sección 2.2, podemos utilizar este método para ajustar las puntuaciones de nivel intermedio (desde el punto de la moda hasta el percentil 90). Se espera que este método de fusión no lineal más complicado logre mejores resultados que el lineal. Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parámetros de manera exhaustiva. Los experimentos actuales en la Sección 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple. 2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de fusión Dado que nuestra función objetivo es hacer que las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro no referencial y el foro de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible, es natural investigar qué tan cerca llegan a estar entre sí y cómo cambian las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web entre los dos foros no referenciales antes y después de la fusión de puntuaciones. Tomando la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la Comunidad Web 1) y un foro no de referencia, lo que corresponde a minimizar la función objetivo en los enlaces rojos discontinuos (ocultos). Después de la optimización, debemos preguntarnos qué sucede con las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros no de referencia. O, en otras palabras, ¿se vuelven más consistentes las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces verdes discontinuos (ocultos)? Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de rendimiento δ para cuantificar los cambios en las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web como δkl = Sim(Slk, Skl) - Sim(Slk ∗, Skl ∗) (10) donde Skl = (Skl 1, ..., Skl Ikl)T, Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1, ..., eSkl Ikl)T y Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b||. δkl > 0 significa que después de la fusión de puntuaciones, las puntuaciones en los mismos objetos web entre el k-ésimo y el l-ésimo foro web se vuelven más consistentes, lo cual es lo que esperamos. Por el contrario, si δkl < 0, esas puntuaciones se vuelven más inconsistentes. Aunque no podemos depender de esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusión, ya que clasificar fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificación intermedios y proporcionar información sobre el rendimiento final de diferentes métodos de clasificación. 2.6 Contrastes con Otros Trabajos Relacionados Ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los métodos propuestos con los métodos tradicionales, como PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y los algoritmos de LinkFusion [27] en la Sección 1. Aquí discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas. El problema actual también puede ser visto como un problema de agregación de rangos [13, 14] ya que tratamos con la cuestión de cómo combinar varias listas de rangos. Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos. En primer lugar, a diferencia de las páginas web, que pueden ser detectadas fácil y precisamente como las mismas páginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados con cierta precisión y recuperación. Segundo, los números de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeños en comparación con el total de conjuntos de fotos (ver Tabla 1). En otras palabras, las listas de clasificación de los K mejores de diferentes foros web son casi disjuntas para una consulta dada. Bajo esta condición, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como sus medidas - distancia de Kendall tau o distancia de la regla de Spearman - degenerarán en algunos casos triviales. Otra categoría de métodos de fusión de rangos (agregación) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automático, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12]. Todos estos métodos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo. En la configuración actual, es difícil o incluso imposible etiquetar estos conjuntos de datos según su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para clasificar. En cambio, el problema aquí es cómo combinar varias sub listas ordenadas para formar una lista de orden total. 3. EXPERIMENTOS En esta sección, llevamos a cabo nuestra investigación sobre la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. Primero presentamos brevemente el nuevo motor de búsqueda de imágenes verticales propuesto - EnjoyPhoto en la sección 3.1. Luego nos enfocamos en cómo clasificar fotos de diferentes foros web. Para hacerlo, primero normalizamos las puntuaciones (calificaciones) de las fotos de diferentes foros web múltiples en la sección 3.2. Luego intentamos encontrar fotos duplicadas en la sección 3.3. Algunos resultados intermedios se discuten utilizando la medida δ en la sección 3.4. Finalmente se lleva a cabo un conjunto de estudios de usuarios cuidadosamente para justificar nuestro método propuesto en la sección 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: Motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad Para cumplir con el requisito de los usuarios de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, proponemos y construimos un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad - EnjoyPhoto, que aborda los siguientes tres problemas clave: 1. cómo rastrear e indexar fotos, 2. cómo determinar las cualidades de cada foto y 3. cómo mostrar los resultados de búsqueda para hacer que el proceso de búsqueda sea agradable. Para una consulta de texto dada, este sistema clasifica las fotos basándose en una cierta combinación de la relevancia de la foto para esta consulta (Problema 1) y la calidad de la foto (Problema 2), y finalmente las muestra de una manera agradable (Problema 3). En cuanto al tema 3, diseñamos la interfaz del sistema deliberadamente para facilitar el proceso de los usuarios al disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Técnicas como Fisheye y presentación de diapositivas son utilizadas en el sistema actual. La Figura 5 muestra la interfaz. No hablaremos más sobre este tema ya que no es un énfasis de este documento. Figura 5: EnjoyPhoto: un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad y agradable, donde se devuelven 26,477 registros para la consulta de otoño en aproximadamente 0.421 segundos. En cuanto al tema 1, extraímos de un motor de búsqueda comercial un subconjunto de fotos procedentes de varios foros de fotos de todo el mundo, y analizamos explícitamente las páginas web que contienen estas fotos. El número de fotos en la colección de datos es de aproximadamente 2.5 millones. Después del análisis, cada foto se asoció con su título, categoría, descripción, configuración de la cámara, datos EXIF 1 (cuando estuvieran disponibles para imágenes digitales), ubicación (cuando estuviera disponible en algunos foros de fotografía) y varios tipos de calificaciones. Todos estos metadatos son generalmente descripciones precisas o anotaciones para el contenido de la imagen, que luego son indexadas por tecnologías de búsqueda basadas en texto general [9, 18, 11]. En el sistema actual, la función de clasificación fue ajustada específicamente para enfatizar la información de título, categorización y calificación. El tema 2 se aborda esencialmente en las siguientes secciones, las cuales determinan la calidad de las fotos mediante el análisis de las calificaciones proporcionadas por varios foros de fotos en la web. Aquí elegimos seis foros de fotos para estudiar el problema de clasificación y los denominamos como Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E y Web-F. 3.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones de Fotos Se analizan detalladamente diferentes métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en esta sección. En este análisis, las cámaras digitales zero 1 guardan archivos JPEG (.jpg) con datos EXIF (Exchangeable Image File). La configuración de la cámara y la información de la escena son registradas por la cámara en el archivo de imagen. www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 6: Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones medias normalizadas a [0, 10] que suelen ocupar aproximadamente el 30% del número total de fotos en algunos foros web no se tienen en cuenta actualmente. Cómo utilizar estas fotos queda para futuras exploraciones. En la Figura 6, enumeramos las distribuciones de la puntuación media, la cual está transformada a un intervalo fijo [0, 10]. Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones promedio de estos foros web lucen bastante diferentes. Las distribuciones en las Figuras 6(a), 6(b) y 6(e) parecen distribuciones gaussianas, mientras que las de las Figuras 6(d) y 6(f) están dominadas por la puntuación más alta. La razón de estas distribuciones excéntricas para Web-D y Web-F radica en sus sistemas de calificación groseros. De hecho, Web-D y Web-F utilizan escalas de valoración de 2 o 3 puntos, mientras que otros foros web utilizan escalas de valoración de 7 u 14 puntos. Por lo tanto, será problemático si usamos directamente estos puntajes promediados. Además, es muy probable que la puntuación promedio sea manipulada si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando una foto. La Figura 7 muestra el método de normalización de puntuación total por puntajes máximos y mínimos, que es uno de nuestros sistemas de referencia. Todos los puntajes totales de un foro web dado se normalizan a [0, 100] de acuerdo con el puntaje máximo y mínimo del foro web correspondiente. Observamos que la distribución total de puntuaciones de Web-A en la Figura 7(a) tiene dos colas más grandes que todas las demás. Para mostrar la forma de las distribuciones de manera más clara, solo mostramos las distribuciones en [0, 25] en la Figura 7(b), 7(c), 7(d), 7(e) y 7(f). La Figura 8 muestra el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%, donde los modos de las seis distribuciones se normalizan a 5 y el percentil 90% a 8. Podemos ver que este método de normalización hace que las distribuciones de las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. Los dos algoritmos propuestos se basan en estos métodos de normalización. 3.3 Detección de fotos duplicadas. Dirigido a la eficiencia computacional, el algoritmo Dedup puede perder cierta tasa de recuperación, pero lograr una alta tasa de precisión. También nos enfocamos en encontrar enlaces ocultos precisos en lugar de todos los enlaces ocultos. La Figura 9 muestra algunos ejemplos de detección de duplicados. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 y verifican que existen grandes cantidades de fotos duplicadas en cualquier par de foros web, incluso con la estricta condición para la Deduplicación donde elegimos los primeros 29 bits como el código hash. Dado que solo hay unos pocos parámetros para estimar en los métodos de fusión propuestos, los números de fotos duplicadas mostrados en la Tabla 1 son 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 7: Normalización Maxmin 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 8: Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90% suficiente para determinar estos parámetros. La última columna de la tabla lista el número total de fotos en los foros web correspondientes. 3.4 δ Medida Los parámetros de los algoritmos lineales y no lineales propuestos se calculan utilizando los datos duplicados mostrados en la Tabla 1, donde se elige Web-C como el foro web de referencia ya que comparte la mayoría de las fotos duplicadas con otros foros. Las tablas 2 y 3 muestran la medida δ en el modelo lineal y el modelo no lineal. Dado que δkl es simétrico y δkk = 0, solo mostramos la parte triangular superior. Los valores NaN en ambas tablas se encuentran en que no se han detectado fotos duplicadas por el algoritmo Dedup, como se informa en la Tabla 1. El modelo lineal garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la Tabla 1: Número de fotos duplicadas entre cada par de foros web A B C D E F Escala A 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k B 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675k C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D 178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155k E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448k F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122k 383 Figura 9: Algunos resultados de la detección de fotos duplicadas Tabla 2: Medida δ en el modelo lineal. La comunidad de referencia debería ser teóricamente no menor a 0. Es, de hecho, el caso (ver los números subrayados en la Tabla 2). Pero este modelo no puede garantizar que las medidas de δ en las comunidades no referenciales también sean iguales o superiores a 0, ya que los pasos de normalización se basan en fotos duplicadas entre la comunidad de referencia y una comunidad no referencial. Los resultados muestran que todos los números en la medida δ son mayores que 0 (ver todos los números no subrayados en la Tabla 2), lo cual indica que es probable que este modelo dé resultados óptimos. Por el contrario, el modelo no lineal no garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la comunidad de referencia deban ser no inferiores a 0, ya que no todas las fotos duplicadas entre los dos foros web pueden ser utilizadas al optimizar este modelo. De hecho, las fotos duplicadas que se encuentran en intervalos diferentes no serán utilizadas en este modelo. Son estas fotos duplicadas específicas las que hacen que la medida δ sea negativa. Como resultado, hay tanto elementos negativos como positivos en la Tabla 3, pero en general el número de positivos es mayor que el de negativos (9:5), lo que indica que el modelo puede ser mejor que el método de normalización únicamente (ver siguiente subsección) que tiene una medida δ completamente nula, y peor que el modelo lineal. 3.5 Estudio de Usuario Debido a que es difícil encontrar un criterio objetivo para evaluar la Tabla 3: medida δ en el modelo no lineal. Web-B Web-C Web-D Web-E Web-F Web-A 0.0559 0.0054 -0.0185 -0.0054 NaN Web-B - -0.0162 -0.0345 -0.0301 0.0466 Web-C - - 0.0136 0.0071 0.1264 Web-D - - - 0.0032 0.0143 Web-E - - - - 0.214 qué función de clasificación es mejor, optamos por realizar estudios de usuario para evaluaciones subjetivas. Diez sujetos fueron invitados a participar en el estudio de usuarios. Fueron reclutados de universidades cercanas. Dado que los motores de búsqueda de búsqueda de texto y búsqueda de imágenes son familiares para los estudiantes universitarios, no había un criterio previo para elegir a los estudiantes. Realizamos estudios de usuarios utilizando Internet Explorer 6.0 en Windows XP con monitores LCD de 17 pulgadas configurados en 1,280 píxeles por 1,024 píxeles en color de 32 bits. Los datos fueron registrados con registros del servidor y encuestas en papel después de cada tarea. Figura 10: Interfaz del estudio de usuario. Específicamente diseñamos una interfaz para el estudio de usuario como se muestra en la Figura 10. Para cada par de métodos de fusión, se alentó a los participantes a probar cualquier consulta que desearan. Para aquellos sin ideas específicas, se enumeraron dos cuadros combinados (lista de categorías y lista de consultas) en el panel inferior, donde se proporcionaron las 1,000 consultas de búsqueda de imágenes principales de un motor de búsqueda comercial. Después de que un participante envió una consulta, el sistema seleccionó aleatoriamente el marco izquierdo o derecho para mostrar cada uno de los dos resultados de clasificación. Los participantes debían luego juzgar cuál de los dos resultados de clasificación era mejor, o si los dos resultados de clasificación tenían la misma calidad, y enviar el juicio eligiendo el botón de radio correspondiente y haciendo clic en el botón de enviar. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 10, se envía la consulta \"sunset\" al sistema. Entonces, 79,092 fotos fueron devueltas y clasificadas por el método de fusión Minmax en el marco izquierdo y el método de fusión lineal en el marco derecho. Un participante luego compara los dos resultados de clasificación (sin conocer los métodos de clasificación) y envía sus comentarios eligiendo respuestas en la opción Tuya. Tabla 4: Resultados del estudio de usuario Norm. Solo Manual Lineal Lineal 29:13:10 14:22:15 No lineal 29:15:9 12:27:12 6:4:45 La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados experimentales, donde Lineal denota el método de fusión lineal, No lineal denota el método de fusión no lineal, Norm. Solo significa el método de normalización Maxmin, Manualmente significa el método ajustado manualmente. Los tres números en cada ítem, por ejemplo 29:13:10, significan que 29 juicios prefieren los resultados de fusión lineal, 10 384 juicios prefieren el método de normalización solamente, y 13 juicios consideran que estos dos métodos son equivalentes. Realizamos el análisis de ANOVA y obtenemos las siguientes conclusiones: 1. Tanto los métodos lineales como no lineales son significativamente mejores que la Norma. El único método con valores P respectivos de 0.00165 (< 0.05) y 0.00073 (<< 0.05). Este resultado es consistente con el resultado de la evaluación de la medida δ. La norma. El único método asume que las 10% mejores fotos en diferentes foros tienen la misma calidad. Sin embargo, esta suposición no se sostiene en general. Por ejemplo, una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de primer nivel generalmente tiene una calidad superior a una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de segundo nivel. Esto es similar a eso, los estudiantes del 10% superior en una universidad de primer nivel y los de una universidad de segundo nivel suelen ser de diferente calidad. Tanto los métodos de fusión lineal como no lineal reconocen la existencia de tales diferencias y buscan cuantificarlas. Por lo tanto, ellos se desempeñan mejor que la norma. Único método. 2. El método de fusión lineal es significativamente mejor que el no lineal con un valor P de 1.195 × 10−10. Este resultado es bastante sorprendente ya que se espera que este método de clasificación más complicado ajuste la clasificación de manera más precisa que el lineal. La razón principal de este resultado puede ser que es difícil encontrar los mejores intervalos donde se debe llevar a cabo el ajuste no lineal y, sin embargo, simplemente se eligió la parte central del método de Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90%. Los métodos de evaluación que consumen mucho tiempo y son subjetivos - estudios de usuario - nos impidieron ajustar extensamente estos parámetros. 3. Los métodos lineales y no lineales propuestos tienen un rendimiento casi igual o ligeramente mejor que el método ajustado manualmente. Dado que los métodos de fusión lineal/no lineal son enfoques completamente automáticos, se consideran soluciones prácticas y eficientes cuando se necesite integrar más comunidades (por ejemplo, docenas de comunidades). 4. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJO FUTURO En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web en los casos de falta de relaciones entre objetos donde los algoritmos de clasificación tradicionales ya no son válidos, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. Hemos construido un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical de alta calidad y propuesto métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas fuentes de datos (foros web) como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por el <br>algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas</br>, y minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son una solución práctica y eficiente para la clasificación de objetos web en las relaciones mencionadas. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros tipos de objetos web, incluyendo videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, música, dibujos, esculturas, y así sucesivamente. El sistema actual está lejos de ser perfecto. Para hacer este sistema más efectivo, se necesitan análisis más delicados para el dominio vertical (por ejemplo, foros de fotos en la web). Los siguientes puntos, por ejemplo, pueden mejorar los resultados de búsqueda y serán nuestro trabajo futuro: 1. un análisis más sutil y luego la utilización de diferentes tipos de calificaciones (por ejemplo, calificaciones de novedad, calificaciones estéticas); 2. diferenciar diversas comunidades que pueden tener diferentes intereses y preferencias o incluso entendimientos culturales distintos; 3. incorporar más información útil, incluida la información de fotógrafos y revisores, para modelar las fotos en un espacio de datos heterogéneo en lugar del actual homogéneo. Utilizaremos aún más el filtrado colaborativo para recomendar fotos relevantes de alta calidad a los navegadores. Un problema abierto es si podemos encontrar un criterio objetivo y eficiente para evaluar los resultados de clasificación, en lugar de emplear estudios de usuario subjetivos e ineficientes, que nos impidieron probar más algoritmos de clasificación y ajustar parámetros en un algoritmo.

                "49, Zhichun Road Haidian District, Beijing, 100080, P R China ABSTRACT Vertical search is a promising direction as it leverages domainspecific knowledge and can provide more precise information for users.",
                "In this paper, we study the Web object-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.",
                "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection <br>algorithm</br>, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval; G.2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory; H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services - Web-based services General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
                "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning <br>algorithm</br> for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient <br>algorithm</br> to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our <br>algorithm</br>.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking <br>algorithm</br> can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "<br>algorithm</br> 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection <br>algorithm</br> [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed <br>algorithm</br> will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection <br>algorithm</br>, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This <br>algorithm</br> uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",

                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",

                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un <br>algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas</br>, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información; G.2.2 [Matemáticas Discretas]: Teoría de Grafos; H.3.5 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Servicios de Información en Línea - Servicios basados en la web Términos Generales Algoritmos, Experimentación 1. A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y <br>algoritmos</br> de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de objetos web en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un <br>algoritmo</br> eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro <br>algoritmo</br>. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el <br>algoritmo</br> de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2.

                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: <br>nonlinear fusion method</br>.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música.

A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de objetos web en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2. ALGORITMO 2.1 Resumen La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web radica en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente existen dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros utilizan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros utilizan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o de 10 puntos. Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero un análisis detallado de los datos y experimentos muestra que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, la misma puntuación no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. De manera intuitiva, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos establecer relaciones entre cualquier par de foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante la normalización y transformación de puntuaciones. Afortunadamente, descubrimos que existe un buen número de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos en la web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de obtener una amplia difusión. En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente de detección de fotos duplicadas [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Ante la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se requiere un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como el foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas deberían ser iguales aunque estén en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes foros, excepto en el foro de referencia, pueden variar en un espacio paramétrico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntuación. Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer que las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas en foros no de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible a las del foro de referencia, podemos resolver eficazmente el problema de clasificación. Para mayor comodidad, se emplean las siguientes notaciones. Ski y ¯Ski denotan la puntuación total y la puntuación media del i-ésimo objeto web (foto) en el k-ésimo sitio web, respectivamente. La puntuación total se refiere a la suma de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación (por ejemplo, la puntuación de novedad y la puntuación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Además, utilizamos {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} para denotar el conjunto de puntuaciones de objetos web (fotos) en los foros web k-ésimos que son duplicados con los foros web l-ésimos, donde Ikl es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusión de puntuaciones se puede ver como el procedimiento de encontrar K transformaciones ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K de manera que eSki se pueda utilizar para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma un subgrafo, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas). El párrafo puede formularse como min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 como el foro de referencia y por lo tanto ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que puede establecerse heurísticamente según el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro no de referencia. Cuanto más revisores haya, más popular será la foto y mayor debería ser el peso correspondiente ¯wk i. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk i y simplemente los establecemos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk i, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea mencionada anteriormente. La Comunidad Web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web enlazados son en realidad el mismo. El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., K), el cual tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo a ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la Ecuación 1, se realiza la suma en todas las líneas punteadas rojas. Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en la Sección 2.2, que servirá como base para el trabajo siguiente. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método ajustado manualmente en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso impráctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar de manera precisa fotos duplicadas entre foros web. Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: Fusión lineal y Fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5. Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algunos otros trabajos relacionados. 2.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones Dado que los diferentes foros web (de fotos) en la web suelen tener diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión. Además, dado que existen muchos tipos de calificaciones, como calificaciones para novedad, calificaciones para estética, etc., es razonable elegir una común, como la puntuación total o la puntuación promedio, que siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calcular a partir de las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el método de normalización en la puntuación total o puntuación promedio sea visto como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar las puntuaciones promedio mediante su transformación lineal a un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntuación como Puntuación Media Escalada. La dificultad, sin embargo, de utilizar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que la puntuación promedio para el objeto sea manipulada o sesgada. La puntuación total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como la calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema radica en cómo normalizar las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros web. La forma más sencilla puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas. La desventaja de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos. Para hacer que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%. Aquí, la puntuación modal representa la puntuación total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total. Y El puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de las imágenes tiene un puntaje total más bajo. Este método de normalización utiliza la moda y el percentil 90 como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo en diferentes foros de fotografía, es que aunque las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar considerablemente y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad intermedia (desde la moda hasta el percentil 90) debería ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (rigurosidad) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel intermedio en un foro web suelen ocupar más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un análisis más detallado de las puntuaciones en la Sección 3.2. 2.3 Fusión Manual El foro de películas en la web, IMDB [16], propuso utilizar una función de clasificación bayesiana para normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación dentro de una comunidad. Motivados por esta función de clasificación, proponemos este método de fusión manual: Para el k-ésimo sitio web, utilizamos la siguiente fórmula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) para clasificar fotos, donde nk es el número de votos y n∗ k, S∗ k y αk son tres parámetros. Esta función de clasificación primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuación media original ¯Ski y una puntuación de referencia S∗ k para obtener una puntuación media ponderada que puede ser más confiable que ¯Ski. Entonces, la puntuación media ponderada se escala por αk para obtener la puntuación final fSki. Para n comunidades web, hay aproximadamente 3n parámetros en {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} para ajustar. Aunque este método puede lograr resultados bastante buenos después de ajustes manuales cuidadosos y exhaustivos en estos parámetros, cuando n se vuelve cada vez más grande, por ejemplo, si hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web rastreadas e indexadas, este método se volverá cada vez más laborioso y eventualmente se volverá impracticable. Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un método de fusión efectivo cuyos parámetros puedan determinarse automáticamente. 2.4 Detección de Fotos Duplicadas Utilizamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo eficiente y efectivo de detección de imágenes duplicadas, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre cualquier par de foros de fotos. Este algoritmo utiliza una función hash para mapear una característica de alta dimensión a un código hash de 32 bits (ver abajo para cómo construir el código hash). La complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imágenes duplicadas entre n imágenes es aproximadamente O(n log n). La característica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrículas regulares de k × k. Basándose en todas las características extraídas de la base de datos de imágenes, se construye un modelo de PCA. Las características visuales son luego transformadas a un espacio PCA de baja dimensionalidad y media cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema. Entonces, el código hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensión se transforma en uno si el valor en esta dimensión es mayor que 0, y en 0 en caso contrario. Las fotos en el mismo grupo se consideran posibles duplicados y se filtran aún más por un umbral en términos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de características visuales. La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde se extraen características visuales - valores de gris promedio - en cuadrículas de 6 × 6 y 7 × 7. Las características de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el código hash se genera de acuerdo a los signos. Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la detección de fotos duplicadas. 2.5 Fusión de Puntuaciones En esta sección, presentaremos dos soluciones sobre la fusión de puntuaciones basadas en diferentes suposiciones de forma paramétrica de ψk en la Ecuación 1. 2.5.1 Fusión Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas. Intuitivamente, la forma más directa de eliminar las incertidumbres causadas por los diferentes criterios es escalar, relativo a un centro dado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foto de foro web no referenciada con respecto al foro de referencia. Más estrictamente, asumimos que ψk tiene la siguiente forma ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones del foro k(= 1) deben escalarse por αk en relación al centro tk 1−αk, como se muestra en la Figura 3. Entonces, si sustituimos ψk anterior en la Ec. 1, obtenemos la siguiente función objetivo, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K donde f es la función objetivo definida en la Ec. 5, obtenemos la solución en forma cerrada como: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) donde Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un método de fusión lineal. Disfruta de la simplicidad y el excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos. Figura 3: Método de Fusión Lineal 2.5.2 Fusión No Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas A veces queremos un método que pueda ajustar puntuaciones en intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios. Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el método puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] dejando las puntuaciones C0 y C1 sin cambios. Este tipo de método de fusión es mucho más refinado que los lineales y contiene muchos más parámetros para ajustar y se espera que mejore aún más los resultados. Aquí proponemos una solución de fusión no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones. Primero, introducimos una transformación: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, si x ∈ (c0, c1] x en otro caso donde α > 0. Esta transformación satisface que para x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] con ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 y ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1. Luego podemos utilizar esta transformación no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figura 4: Método de fusión no lineal. Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento. Aunque no hay una solución en forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimización, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2, no es difícil obtener la solución numérica. Bajo las mismas suposiciones hechas en la Sección 2.2, podemos utilizar este método para ajustar las puntuaciones de nivel intermedio (desde el punto de la moda hasta el percentil 90). Se espera que este método de fusión no lineal más complicado logre mejores resultados que el lineal. Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parámetros de manera exhaustiva. Los experimentos actuales en la Sección 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple. 2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de fusión Dado que nuestra función objetivo es hacer que las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro no referencial y el foro de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible, es natural investigar qué tan cerca llegan a estar entre sí y cómo cambian las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web entre los dos foros no referenciales antes y después de la fusión de puntuaciones. Tomando la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la Comunidad Web 1) y un foro no de referencia, lo que corresponde a minimizar la función objetivo en los enlaces rojos discontinuos (ocultos). Después de la optimización, debemos preguntarnos qué sucede con las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros no de referencia. O, en otras palabras, ¿se vuelven más consistentes las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces verdes discontinuos (ocultos)? Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de rendimiento δ para cuantificar los cambios en las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web como δkl = Sim(Slk, Skl) - Sim(Slk ∗, Skl ∗) (10) donde Skl = (Skl 1, ..., Skl Ikl)T, Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1, ..., eSkl Ikl)T y Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b||. δkl > 0 significa que después de la fusión de puntuaciones, las puntuaciones en los mismos objetos web entre el k-ésimo y el l-ésimo foro web se vuelven más consistentes, lo cual es lo que esperamos. Por el contrario, si δkl < 0, esas puntuaciones se vuelven más inconsistentes. Aunque no podemos depender de esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusión, ya que clasificar fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificación intermedios y proporcionar información sobre el rendimiento final de diferentes métodos de clasificación. 2.6 Contrastes con Otros Trabajos Relacionados Ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los métodos propuestos con los métodos tradicionales, como PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y los algoritmos de LinkFusion [27] en la Sección 1. Aquí discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas. El problema actual también puede ser visto como un problema de agregación de rangos [13, 14] ya que tratamos con la cuestión de cómo combinar varias listas de rangos. Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos. En primer lugar, a diferencia de las páginas web, que pueden ser detectadas fácil y precisamente como las mismas páginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados con cierta precisión y recuperación. Segundo, los números de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeños en comparación con el total de conjuntos de fotos (ver Tabla 1). En otras palabras, las listas de clasificación de los K mejores de diferentes foros web son casi disjuntas para una consulta dada. Bajo esta condición, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como sus medidas - distancia de Kendall tau o distancia de la regla de Spearman - degenerarán en algunos casos triviales. Otra categoría de métodos de fusión de rangos (agregación) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automático, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12]. Todos estos métodos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo. En la configuración actual, es difícil o incluso imposible etiquetar estos conjuntos de datos según su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para clasificar. En cambio, el problema aquí es cómo combinar varias sub listas ordenadas para formar una lista de orden total. 3. EXPERIMENTOS En esta sección, llevamos a cabo nuestra investigación sobre la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. Primero presentamos brevemente el nuevo motor de búsqueda de imágenes verticales propuesto - EnjoyPhoto en la sección 3.1. Luego nos enfocamos en cómo clasificar fotos de diferentes foros web. Para hacerlo, primero normalizamos las puntuaciones (calificaciones) de las fotos de diferentes foros web múltiples en la sección 3.2. Luego intentamos encontrar fotos duplicadas en la sección 3.3. Algunos resultados intermedios se discuten utilizando la medida δ en la sección 3.4. Finalmente se lleva a cabo un conjunto de estudios de usuarios cuidadosamente para justificar nuestro método propuesto en la sección 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: Motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad Para cumplir con el requisito de los usuarios de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, proponemos y construimos un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad - EnjoyPhoto, que aborda los siguientes tres problemas clave: 1. cómo rastrear e indexar fotos, 2. cómo determinar las cualidades de cada foto y 3. cómo mostrar los resultados de búsqueda para hacer que el proceso de búsqueda sea agradable. Para una consulta de texto dada, este sistema clasifica las fotos basándose en una cierta combinación de la relevancia de la foto para esta consulta (Problema 1) y la calidad de la foto (Problema 2), y finalmente las muestra de una manera agradable (Problema 3). En cuanto al tema 3, diseñamos la interfaz del sistema deliberadamente para facilitar el proceso de los usuarios al disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Técnicas como Fisheye y presentación de diapositivas son utilizadas en el sistema actual. La Figura 5 muestra la interfaz. No hablaremos más sobre este tema ya que no es un énfasis de este documento. Figura 5: EnjoyPhoto: un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad y agradable, donde se devuelven 26,477 registros para la consulta de otoño en aproximadamente 0.421 segundos. En cuanto al tema 1, extraímos de un motor de búsqueda comercial un subconjunto de fotos procedentes de varios foros de fotos de todo el mundo, y analizamos explícitamente las páginas web que contienen estas fotos. El número de fotos en la colección de datos es de aproximadamente 2.5 millones. Después del análisis, cada foto se asoció con su título, categoría, descripción, configuración de la cámara, datos EXIF 1 (cuando estuvieran disponibles para imágenes digitales), ubicación (cuando estuviera disponible en algunos foros de fotografía) y varios tipos de calificaciones. Todos estos metadatos son generalmente descripciones precisas o anotaciones para el contenido de la imagen, que luego son indexadas por tecnologías de búsqueda basadas en texto general [9, 18, 11]. En el sistema actual, la función de clasificación fue ajustada específicamente para enfatizar la información de título, categorización y calificación. El tema 2 se aborda esencialmente en las siguientes secciones, las cuales determinan la calidad de las fotos mediante el análisis de las calificaciones proporcionadas por varios foros de fotos en la web. Aquí elegimos seis foros de fotos para estudiar el problema de clasificación y los denominamos como Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E y Web-F. 3.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones de Fotos Se analizan detalladamente diferentes métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en esta sección. En este análisis, las cámaras digitales zero 1 guardan archivos JPEG (.jpg) con datos EXIF (Exchangeable Image File). La configuración de la cámara y la información de la escena son registradas por la cámara en el archivo de imagen. www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 6: Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones medias normalizadas a [0, 10] que suelen ocupar aproximadamente el 30% del número total de fotos en algunos foros web no se tienen en cuenta actualmente. Cómo utilizar estas fotos queda para futuras exploraciones. En la Figura 6, enumeramos las distribuciones de la puntuación media, la cual está transformada a un intervalo fijo [0, 10]. Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones promedio de estos foros web lucen bastante diferentes. Las distribuciones en las Figuras 6(a), 6(b) y 6(e) parecen distribuciones gaussianas, mientras que las de las Figuras 6(d) y 6(f) están dominadas por la puntuación más alta. La razón de estas distribuciones excéntricas para Web-D y Web-F radica en sus sistemas de calificación groseros. De hecho, Web-D y Web-F utilizan escalas de valoración de 2 o 3 puntos, mientras que otros foros web utilizan escalas de valoración de 7 u 14 puntos. Por lo tanto, será problemático si usamos directamente estos puntajes promediados. Además, es muy probable que la puntuación promedio sea manipulada si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando una foto. La Figura 7 muestra el método de normalización de puntuación total por puntajes máximos y mínimos, que es uno de nuestros sistemas de referencia. Todos los puntajes totales de un foro web dado se normalizan a [0, 100] de acuerdo con el puntaje máximo y mínimo del foro web correspondiente. Observamos que la distribución total de puntuaciones de Web-A en la Figura 7(a) tiene dos colas más grandes que todas las demás. Para mostrar la forma de las distribuciones de manera más clara, solo mostramos las distribuciones en [0, 25] en la Figura 7(b), 7(c), 7(d), 7(e) y 7(f). La Figura 8 muestra el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%, donde los modos de las seis distribuciones se normalizan a 5 y el percentil 90% a 8. Podemos ver que este método de normalización hace que las distribuciones de las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. Los dos algoritmos propuestos se basan en estos métodos de normalización. 3.3 Detección de fotos duplicadas. Dirigido a la eficiencia computacional, el algoritmo Dedup puede perder cierta tasa de recuperación, pero lograr una alta tasa de precisión. También nos enfocamos en encontrar enlaces ocultos precisos en lugar de todos los enlaces ocultos. La Figura 9 muestra algunos ejemplos de detección de duplicados. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 y verifican que existen grandes cantidades de fotos duplicadas en cualquier par de foros web, incluso con la estricta condición para la Deduplicación donde elegimos los primeros 29 bits como el código hash. Dado que solo hay unos pocos parámetros para estimar en los métodos de fusión propuestos, los números de fotos duplicadas mostrados en la Tabla 1 son 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 7: Normalización Maxmin 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 8: Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90% suficiente para determinar estos parámetros. La última columna de la tabla lista el número total de fotos en los foros web correspondientes. 3.4 δ Medida Los parámetros de los algoritmos lineales y no lineales propuestos se calculan utilizando los datos duplicados mostrados en la Tabla 1, donde se elige Web-C como el foro web de referencia ya que comparte la mayoría de las fotos duplicadas con otros foros. Las tablas 2 y 3 muestran la medida δ en el modelo lineal y el modelo no lineal. Dado que δkl es simétrico y δkk = 0, solo mostramos la parte triangular superior. Los valores NaN en ambas tablas se encuentran en que no se han detectado fotos duplicadas por el algoritmo Dedup, como se informa en la Tabla 1. El modelo lineal garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la Tabla 1: Número de fotos duplicadas entre cada par de foros web A B C D E F Escala A 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k B 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675k C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D 178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155k E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448k F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122k 383 Figura 9: Algunos resultados de la detección de fotos duplicadas Tabla 2: Medida δ en el modelo lineal. La comunidad de referencia debería ser teóricamente no menor a 0. Es, de hecho, el caso (ver los números subrayados en la Tabla 2). Pero este modelo no puede garantizar que las medidas de δ en las comunidades no referenciales también sean iguales o superiores a 0, ya que los pasos de normalización se basan en fotos duplicadas entre la comunidad de referencia y una comunidad no referencial. Los resultados muestran que todos los números en la medida δ son mayores que 0 (ver todos los números no subrayados en la Tabla 2), lo cual indica que es probable que este modelo dé resultados óptimos. Por el contrario, el modelo no lineal no garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la comunidad de referencia deban ser no inferiores a 0, ya que no todas las fotos duplicadas entre los dos foros web pueden ser utilizadas al optimizar este modelo. De hecho, las fotos duplicadas que se encuentran en intervalos diferentes no serán utilizadas en este modelo. Son estas fotos duplicadas específicas las que hacen que la medida δ sea negativa. Como resultado, hay tanto elementos negativos como positivos en la Tabla 3, pero en general el número de positivos es mayor que el de negativos (9:5), lo que indica que el modelo puede ser mejor que el método de normalización únicamente (ver siguiente subsección) que tiene una medida δ completamente nula, y peor que el modelo lineal. 3.5 Estudio de Usuario Debido a que es difícil encontrar un criterio objetivo para evaluar la Tabla 3: medida δ en el modelo no lineal. Web-B Web-C Web-D Web-E Web-F Web-A 0.0559 0.0054 -0.0185 -0.0054 NaN Web-B - -0.0162 -0.0345 -0.0301 0.0466 Web-C - - 0.0136 0.0071 0.1264 Web-D - - - 0.0032 0.0143 Web-E - - - - 0.214 qué función de clasificación es mejor, optamos por realizar estudios de usuario para evaluaciones subjetivas. Diez sujetos fueron invitados a participar en el estudio de usuarios. Fueron reclutados de universidades cercanas. Dado que los motores de búsqueda de búsqueda de texto y búsqueda de imágenes son familiares para los estudiantes universitarios, no había un criterio previo para elegir a los estudiantes. Realizamos estudios de usuarios utilizando Internet Explorer 6.0 en Windows XP con monitores LCD de 17 pulgadas configurados en 1,280 píxeles por 1,024 píxeles en color de 32 bits. Los datos fueron registrados con registros del servidor y encuestas en papel después de cada tarea. Figura 10: Interfaz del estudio de usuario. Específicamente diseñamos una interfaz para el estudio de usuario como se muestra en la Figura 10. Para cada par de métodos de fusión, se alentó a los participantes a probar cualquier consulta que desearan. Para aquellos sin ideas específicas, se enumeraron dos cuadros combinados (lista de categorías y lista de consultas) en el panel inferior, donde se proporcionaron las 1,000 consultas de búsqueda de imágenes principales de un motor de búsqueda comercial. Después de que un participante envió una consulta, el sistema seleccionó aleatoriamente el marco izquierdo o derecho para mostrar cada uno de los dos resultados de clasificación. Los participantes debían luego juzgar cuál de los dos resultados de clasificación era mejor, o si los dos resultados de clasificación tenían la misma calidad, y enviar el juicio eligiendo el botón de radio correspondiente y haciendo clic en el botón de enviar. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 10, se envía la consulta \"sunset\" al sistema. Entonces, 79,092 fotos fueron devueltas y clasificadas por el método de fusión Minmax en el marco izquierdo y el método de fusión lineal en el marco derecho. Un participante luego compara los dos resultados de clasificación (sin conocer los métodos de clasificación) y envía sus comentarios eligiendo respuestas en la opción Tuya. Tabla 4: Resultados del estudio de usuario Norm. Solo Manual Lineal Lineal 29:13:10 14:22:15 No lineal 29:15:9 12:27:12 6:4:45 La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados experimentales, donde Lineal denota el método de fusión lineal, No lineal denota el método de fusión no lineal, Norm. Solo significa el método de normalización Maxmin, Manualmente significa el método ajustado manualmente. Los tres números en cada ítem, por ejemplo 29:13:10, significan que 29 juicios prefieren los resultados de fusión lineal, 10 384 juicios prefieren el método de normalización solamente, y 13 juicios consideran que estos dos métodos son equivalentes. Realizamos el análisis de ANOVA y obtenemos las siguientes conclusiones: 1. Tanto los métodos lineales como no lineales son significativamente mejores que la Norma. El único método con valores P respectivos de 0.00165 (< 0.05) y 0.00073 (<< 0.05). Este resultado es consistente con el resultado de la evaluación de la medida δ. La norma. El único método asume que las 10% mejores fotos en diferentes foros tienen la misma calidad. Sin embargo, esta suposición no se sostiene en general. Por ejemplo, una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de primer nivel generalmente tiene una calidad superior a una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de segundo nivel. Esto es similar a eso, los estudiantes del 10% superior en una universidad de primer nivel y los de una universidad de segundo nivel suelen ser de diferente calidad. Tanto los métodos de fusión lineal como no lineal reconocen la existencia de tales diferencias y buscan cuantificarlas. Por lo tanto, ellos se desempeñan mejor que la norma. Único método. 2. El método de fusión lineal es significativamente mejor que el no lineal con un valor P de 1.195 × 10−10. Este resultado es bastante sorprendente ya que se espera que este método de clasificación más complicado ajuste la clasificación de manera más precisa que el lineal. La razón principal de este resultado puede ser que es difícil encontrar los mejores intervalos donde se debe llevar a cabo el ajuste no lineal y, sin embargo, simplemente se eligió la parte central del método de Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90%. Los métodos de evaluación que consumen mucho tiempo y son subjetivos - estudios de usuario - nos impidieron ajustar extensamente estos parámetros. 3. Los métodos lineales y no lineales propuestos tienen un rendimiento casi igual o ligeramente mejor que el método ajustado manualmente. Dado que los métodos de fusión lineal/no lineal son enfoques completamente automáticos, se consideran soluciones prácticas y eficientes cuando se necesite integrar más comunidades (por ejemplo, docenas de comunidades). 4. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJO FUTURO En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web en los casos de falta de relaciones entre objetos donde los algoritmos de clasificación tradicionales ya no son válidos, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. Hemos construido un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical de alta calidad y propuesto métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas fuentes de datos (foros web) como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por el algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son una solución práctica y eficiente para la clasificación de objetos web en las relaciones mencionadas. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros tipos de objetos web, incluyendo videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, música, dibujos, esculturas, y así sucesivamente. El sistema actual está lejos de ser perfecto. Para hacer este sistema más efectivo, se necesitan análisis más delicados para el dominio vertical (por ejemplo, foros de fotos en la web). Los siguientes puntos, por ejemplo, pueden mejorar los resultados de búsqueda y serán nuestro trabajo futuro: 1. un análisis más sutil y luego la utilización de diferentes tipos de calificaciones (por ejemplo, calificaciones de novedad, calificaciones estéticas); 2. diferenciar diversas comunidades que pueden tener diferentes intereses y preferencias o incluso entendimientos culturales distintos; 3. incorporar más información útil, incluida la información de fotógrafos y revisores, para modelar las fotos en un espacio de datos heterogéneo en lugar del actual homogéneo. Utilizaremos aún más el filtrado colaborativo para recomendar fotos relevantes de alta calidad a los navegadores. Un problema abierto es si podemos encontrar un criterio objetivo y eficiente para evaluar los resultados de clasificación, en lugar de emplear estudios de usuario subjetivos e ineficientes, que nos impidieron probar más algoritmos de clasificación y ajustar parámetros en un algoritmo.

                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to Web object ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",

                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or Web object ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
                "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the <br>ranking function</br> - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal <br>ranking function</br>. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal <br>ranking function</br>, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",

                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",

                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",

                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",

                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",

                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",

                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K.

                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",

                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música.

A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de objetos web en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la <br>función de clasificación</br>, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una <br>función de clasificación</br> óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la <br>función de clasificación</br> óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2. ALGORITMO 2.1 Resumen La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web radica en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente existen dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros utilizan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros utilizan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o de 10 puntos. Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero un análisis detallado de los datos y experimentos muestra que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, la misma puntuación no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. De manera intuitiva, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos establecer relaciones entre cualquier par de foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante la normalización y transformación de puntuaciones. Afortunadamente, descubrimos que existe un buen número de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos en la web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de obtener una amplia difusión. En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente de detección de fotos duplicadas [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Ante la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se requiere un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como el foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas deberían ser iguales aunque estén en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes foros, excepto en el foro de referencia, pueden variar en un espacio paramétrico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntuación. Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer que las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas en foros no de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible a las del foro de referencia, podemos resolver eficazmente el problema de clasificación. Para mayor comodidad, se emplean las siguientes notaciones. Ski y ¯Ski denotan la puntuación total y la puntuación media del i-ésimo objeto web (foto) en el k-ésimo sitio web, respectivamente. La puntuación total se refiere a la suma de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación (por ejemplo, la puntuación de novedad y la puntuación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Además, utilizamos {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} para denotar el conjunto de puntuaciones de objetos web (fotos) en los foros web k-ésimos que son duplicados con los foros web l-ésimos, donde Ikl es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusión de puntuaciones se puede ver como el procedimiento de encontrar K transformaciones ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K de manera que eSki se pueda utilizar para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma un subgrafo, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas). El párrafo puede formularse como min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 como el foro de referencia y por lo tanto ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que puede establecerse heurísticamente según el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro no de referencia. Cuanto más revisores haya, más popular será la foto y mayor debería ser el peso correspondiente ¯wk i. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk i y simplemente los establecemos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk i, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea mencionada anteriormente. La Comunidad Web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web enlazados son en realidad el mismo. El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., K), el cual tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo a ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la Ecuación 1, se realiza la suma en todas las líneas punteadas rojas. Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en la Sección 2.2, que servirá como base para el trabajo siguiente. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método ajustado manualmente en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso impráctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar de manera precisa fotos duplicadas entre foros web. Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: Fusión lineal y Fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5. Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algunos otros trabajos relacionados. 2.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones Dado que los diferentes foros web (de fotos) en la web suelen tener diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión. Además, dado que existen muchos tipos de calificaciones, como calificaciones para novedad, calificaciones para estética, etc., es razonable elegir una común, como la puntuación total o la puntuación promedio, que siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calcular a partir de las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el método de normalización en la puntuación total o puntuación promedio sea visto como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar las puntuaciones promedio mediante su transformación lineal a un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntuación como Puntuación Media Escalada. La dificultad, sin embargo, de utilizar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que la puntuación promedio para el objeto sea manipulada o sesgada. La puntuación total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como la calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema radica en cómo normalizar las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros web. La forma más sencilla puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas. La desventaja de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos. Para hacer que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%. Aquí, la puntuación modal representa la puntuación total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total. Y El puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de las imágenes tiene un puntaje total más bajo. Este método de normalización utiliza la moda y el percentil 90 como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo en diferentes foros de fotografía, es que aunque las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar considerablemente y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad intermedia (desde la moda hasta el percentil 90) debería ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (rigurosidad) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel intermedio en un foro web suelen ocupar más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un análisis más detallado de las puntuaciones en la Sección 3.2. 2.3 Fusión Manual El foro de películas en la web, IMDB [16], propuso utilizar una <br>función de clasificación</br> bayesiana para normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación dentro de una comunidad. Motivados por esta <br>función de clasificación</br>, proponemos este método de fusión manual: Para el k-ésimo sitio web, utilizamos la siguiente fórmula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) para clasificar fotos, donde nk es el número de votos y n∗ k, S∗ k y αk son tres parámetros.

                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",

                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",

                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",

                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",

                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",

                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",

                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",

                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

                "For a given text based query, this system ranks the photos based on certain combination of relevance of the photo to this query (Issue 1) and the quality of the photo (Issue 2), and finally displays them in an enjoyable manner (Issue 3).",

En este artículo, estudiamos el <br>problema de clasificación de objetos web</br>, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música.

A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el <br>problema de clasificación de objetos web</br> en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de objetos web para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos en detalle las soluciones propuestas al problema de clasificación, incluyendo cómo encontrar enlaces ocultos entre diferentes foros, normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación, obtener la función de clasificación óptima y contrastar nuestros métodos con algunas otras investigaciones relacionadas. En la Sección 3, describimos el entorno experimental y los experimentos y estudios de usuario realizados para evaluar nuestro algoritmo. Nuestra conclusión y una discusión sobre trabajos futuros se encuentran en la Sección 4. Vale la pena señalar que aunque tratamos la búsqueda de fotos verticales como el banco de pruebas en este documento, el algoritmo de clasificación propuesto también se puede aplicar para clasificar otro contenido que incluye videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, dibujos, esculturas, música, y así sucesivamente. 378 2. ALGORITMO 2.1 Resumen La dificultad de integrar múltiples foros web radica en sus diferentes sistemas de calificación, donde generalmente existen dos tipos de libertad. El primer tipo de libertad es el intervalo de calificación o escala de calificación que incluye las calificaciones mínimas y máximas para cada objeto web. Por ejemplo, algunos foros utilizan una escala de calificación de 5 puntos, mientras que otros foros utilizan escalas de calificación de 3 puntos o de 10 puntos. Parece fácil arreglar esta libertad, pero un análisis detallado de los datos y experimentos muestra que es un problema no trivial. El segundo tipo de libertad son los criterios de calificación variables que se encuentran en diferentes foros web. Es decir, la misma puntuación no significa la misma calidad en diferentes foros. De manera intuitiva, si podemos detectar los mismos fotógrafos o las mismas fotografías, podemos establecer relaciones entre cualquier par de foros de fotos y, por lo tanto, podemos estandarizar el criterio de calificación mediante la normalización y transformación de puntuaciones. Afortunadamente, descubrimos que existe un buen número de fotografías duplicadas en varios foros de fotos en la web. Este hecho es razonable al considerar que los fotógrafos a veces envían una foto a más de un foro para obtener críticas o con la esperanza de obtener una amplia difusión. En este trabajo, adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente de detección de fotos duplicadas [10] para encontrar estas fotos. Los métodos propuestos a continuación se basan en las siguientes consideraciones. Ante la necesidad de superar un problema de clasificación, se requiere un criterio de calificación estandarizado en lugar de un criterio de calificación razonable. Por lo tanto, podemos tomar un foro a gran escala como el foro de referencia y alinear otros foros teniendo en cuenta los objetos web duplicados (fotos duplicadas en este trabajo). Idealmente, las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas deberían ser iguales aunque estén en diferentes foros. Sin embargo, podemos considerar que las puntuaciones en diferentes foros, excepto en el foro de referencia, pueden variar en un espacio paramétrico. Esto se puede determinar minimizando la función objetivo definida por la suma de los cuadrados de las diferencias de puntuación. Al formular el problema de clasificación como un problema de optimización que intenta hacer que las puntuaciones de las fotos duplicadas en foros no de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible a las del foro de referencia, podemos resolver eficazmente el problema de clasificación. Para mayor comodidad, se emplean las siguientes notaciones. Ski y ¯Ski denotan la puntuación total y la puntuación media del i-ésimo objeto web (foto) en el k-ésimo sitio web, respectivamente. La puntuación total se refiere a la suma de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación (por ejemplo, la puntuación de novedad y la puntuación estética), y la puntuación media se refiere a la media de las diversas puntuaciones de calificación. Supongamos que hay un total de K sitios web. Además, utilizamos {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} para denotar el conjunto de puntuaciones de objetos web (fotos) en los foros web k-ésimos que son duplicados con los foros web l-ésimos, donde Ikl es el número total de objetos web duplicados entre estos dos sitios web. En general, la fusión de puntuaciones se puede ver como el procedimiento de encontrar K transformaciones ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K de manera que eSki se pueda utilizar para clasificar objetos web de diferentes sitios web. La función objetivo descrita en la Figura 1 anterior: Integración de la comunidad web. Cada comunidad web forma un subgrafo, y todas las comunidades están vinculadas por algunos enlaces ocultos (líneas discontinuas). El párrafo puede formularse como min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) donde usamos k = 1 como el foro de referencia y por lo tanto ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) es el coeficiente de peso que puede establecerse heurísticamente según el número de votantes (revisores o comentaristas) tanto en el foro de referencia como en el foro no de referencia. Cuanto más revisores haya, más popular será la foto y mayor debería ser el peso correspondiente ¯wk i. En este trabajo, no inspeccionamos el problema de cómo elegir ¯wk i y simplemente los establecemos en uno. Pero creemos que el uso adecuado de ¯wk i, que aprovecha más información, puede mejorar significativamente los resultados. La Figura 1 ilustra la idea mencionada anteriormente. La Comunidad Web 1 es la comunidad de referencia. Las líneas discontinuas son enlaces que indican que los dos objetos web enlazados son en realidad el mismo. El algoritmo propuesto intentará encontrar el mejor ψk (k = 2, ..., K), el cual tiene ciertas formas paramétricas de acuerdo a ciertos modelos. Para minimizar la función de costo definida en la Ecuación 1, se realiza la suma en todas las líneas punteadas rojas. Primero discutiremos los métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en la Sección 2.2, que servirá como base para el trabajo siguiente. Antes de describir los algoritmos de clasificación propuestos, primero presentamos un método ajustado manualmente en la Sección 2.3, que es laborioso e incluso impráctico cuando el número de comunidades se vuelve grande. En la Sección 2.4, explicaremos brevemente cómo encontrar de manera precisa fotos duplicadas entre foros web. Luego describiremos los dos métodos propuestos: Fusión lineal y Fusión no lineal, y una medida de rendimiento para la evaluación de resultados en la Sección 2.5. Finalmente, en la Sección 2.6 discutiremos la relación de los métodos propuestos con algunos otros trabajos relacionados. 2.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones Dado que los diferentes foros web (de fotos) en la web suelen tener diferentes criterios de calificación, es necesario normalizarlos antes de aplicar diferentes tipos de métodos de fusión. Además, dado que existen muchos tipos de calificaciones, como calificaciones para novedad, calificaciones para estética, etc., es razonable elegir una común, como la puntuación total o la puntuación promedio, que siempre se puede extraer en cualquier foro web o calcular a partir de las calificaciones correspondientes. Esto permite que el método de normalización en la puntuación total o puntuación promedio sea visto como un método de calificación imparcial entre diferentes foros web. Es sencillo normalizar las puntuaciones promedio mediante su transformación lineal a un intervalo fijo. Llamamos a este tipo de puntuación como Puntuación Media Escalada. La dificultad, sin embargo, de utilizar este método de normalización es que, si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando un objeto, digamos una foto en un foro de fotos, es probable que la puntuación promedio para el objeto sea manipulada o sesgada. La puntuación total puede evitar tales inconvenientes que contienen más información, como la calidad y popularidad de los objetos web. El problema radica en cómo normalizar las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros web. La forma más sencilla puede ser la normalización por las puntuaciones máximas y mínimas. La desventaja de este método de normalización es que no es robusto, o en otras palabras, es sensible a los valores atípicos. Para hacer que la normalización sea insensible a los datos inusuales, proponemos el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%. Aquí, la puntuación modal representa la puntuación total que se ha asignado a más fotos que cualquier otra puntuación total. Y El puntaje de percentil alto (por ejemplo, 90%) representa el puntaje total para el cual el percentil alto de las imágenes tiene un puntaje total más bajo. Este método de normalización utiliza la moda y el percentil 90 como dos puntos de referencia para alinear dos sistemas de calificación, lo que hace que las distribuciones de puntajes totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. La suposición subyacente, por ejemplo en diferentes foros de fotografía, es que aunque las cualidades de las mejores fotos en diferentes foros pueden variar considerablemente y depender menos de la calidad del foro, la distribución de fotos de calidad intermedia (desde la moda hasta el percentil 90) debería ser casi de la misma calidad hasta la libertad que refleja el criterio de calificación (rigurosidad) de los foros web. Las fotos de este nivel intermedio en un foro web suelen ocupar más del 70 % del total de fotos en ese foro. Daremos un análisis más detallado de las puntuaciones en la Sección 3.2. 2.3 Fusión Manual El foro de películas en la web, IMDB [16], propuso utilizar una función de clasificación bayesiana para normalizar las puntuaciones de calificación dentro de una comunidad. Motivados por esta función de clasificación, proponemos este método de fusión manual: Para el k-ésimo sitio web, utilizamos la siguiente fórmula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) para clasificar fotos, donde nk es el número de votos y n∗ k, S∗ k y αk son tres parámetros. Esta función de clasificación primero toma un equilibrio entre la puntuación media original ¯Ski y una puntuación de referencia S∗ k para obtener una puntuación media ponderada que puede ser más confiable que ¯Ski. Entonces, la puntuación media ponderada se escala por αk para obtener la puntuación final fSki. Para n comunidades web, hay aproximadamente 3n parámetros en {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} para ajustar. Aunque este método puede lograr resultados bastante buenos después de ajustes manuales cuidadosos y exhaustivos en estos parámetros, cuando n se vuelve cada vez más grande, por ejemplo, si hay decenas o cientos de comunidades web rastreadas e indexadas, este método se volverá cada vez más laborioso y eventualmente se volverá impracticable. Por lo tanto, es deseable encontrar un método de fusión efectivo cuyos parámetros puedan determinarse automáticamente. 2.4 Detección de Fotos Duplicadas Utilizamos Dedup [10], un algoritmo eficiente y efectivo de detección de imágenes duplicadas, para encontrar fotos duplicadas entre cualquier par de foros de fotos. Este algoritmo utiliza una función hash para mapear una característica de alta dimensión a un código hash de 32 bits (ver abajo para cómo construir el código hash). La complejidad computacional para encontrar todas las imágenes duplicadas entre n imágenes es aproximadamente O(n log n). La característica visual de bajo nivel para cada foto se extrae en cuadrículas regulares de k × k. Basándose en todas las características extraídas de la base de datos de imágenes, se construye un modelo de PCA. Las características visuales son luego transformadas a un espacio PCA de baja dimensionalidad y media cero, o 29 dimensiones en nuestro sistema. Entonces, el código hash para cada foto se construye de la siguiente manera: cada dimensión se transforma en uno si el valor en esta dimensión es mayor que 0, y en 0 en caso contrario. Las fotos en el mismo grupo se consideran posibles duplicados y se filtran aún más por un umbral en términos de similitud euclidiana en el espacio de características visuales. La Figura 2 ilustra el procedimiento de hash, donde se extraen características visuales - valores de gris promedio - en cuadrículas de 6 × 6 y 7 × 7. Las características de 85 dimensiones se transforman en un vector de 32 dimensiones, y el código hash se genera de acuerdo a los signos. Figura 2: Procedimiento de hash para la detección de fotos duplicadas. 2.5 Fusión de Puntuaciones En esta sección, presentaremos dos soluciones sobre la fusión de puntuaciones basadas en diferentes suposiciones de forma paramétrica de ψk en la Ecuación 1. 2.5.1 Fusión Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas. Intuitivamente, la forma más directa de eliminar las incertidumbres causadas por los diferentes criterios es escalar, relativo a un centro dado, las puntuaciones totales de cada foto de foro web no referenciada con respecto al foro de referencia. Más estrictamente, asumimos que ψk tiene la siguiente forma ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4), lo que significa que las puntuaciones del foro k(= 1) deben escalarse por αk en relación al centro tk 1−αk, como se muestra en la Figura 3. Entonces, si sustituimos ψk anterior en la Ec. 1, obtenemos la siguiente función objetivo, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) Al resolver el siguiente conjunto de funciones, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K donde f es la función objetivo definida en la Ec. 5, obtenemos la solución en forma cerrada como: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) donde Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) y k = 2, ..., K. Este es un método de fusión lineal. Disfruta de la simplicidad y el excelente rendimiento en los siguientes experimentos. Figura 3: Método de Fusión Lineal 2.5.2 Fusión No Lineal por Fotos Duplicadas A veces queremos un método que pueda ajustar puntuaciones en intervalos con dos puntos finales sin cambios. Como se ilustra en la Figura 4, el método puede ajustar las puntuaciones entre [C0, C1] dejando las puntuaciones C0 y C1 sin cambios. Este tipo de método de fusión es mucho más refinado que los lineales y contiene muchos más parámetros para ajustar y se espera que mejore aún más los resultados. Aquí proponemos una solución de fusión no lineal para satisfacer tales restricciones. Primero, introducimos una transformación: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, si x ∈ (c0, c1] x en otro caso donde α > 0. Esta transformación satisface que para x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] con ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 y ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1. Luego podemos utilizar esta transformación no lineal para ajustar las puntuaciones en cierto intervalo, digamos (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figura 4: Método de fusión no lineal. Intentamos ajustar finamente la forma de las curvas en cada segmento. Aunque no hay una solución en forma cerrada para el siguiente problema de optimización, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2, no es difícil obtener la solución numérica. Bajo las mismas suposiciones hechas en la Sección 2.2, podemos utilizar este método para ajustar las puntuaciones de nivel intermedio (desde el punto de la moda hasta el percentil 90). Se espera que este método de fusión no lineal más complicado logre mejores resultados que el lineal. Sin embargo, las dificultades para evaluar los resultados de rango nos impiden ajustar estos parámetros de manera exhaustiva. Los experimentos actuales en la Sección 3.5 no revelan ninguna ventaja sobre el modelo lineal simple. 2.5.3 Medida de rendimiento de los resultados de fusión Dado que nuestra función objetivo es hacer que las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web (por ejemplo, fotos duplicadas) entre un foro no referencial y el foro de referencia sean lo más cercanas posible, es natural investigar qué tan cerca llegan a estar entre sí y cómo cambian las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web entre los dos foros no referenciales antes y después de la fusión de puntuaciones. Tomando la Figura 1 como ejemplo, los algoritmos propuestos minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros web: el foro de referencia (la Comunidad Web 1) y un foro no de referencia, lo que corresponde a minimizar la función objetivo en los enlaces rojos discontinuos (ocultos). Después de la optimización, debemos preguntarnos qué sucede con las diferencias de puntuación de los mismos objetos web en dos foros no de referencia. O, en otras palabras, ¿se vuelven más consistentes las puntuaciones de dos objetos vinculados por los enlaces verdes discontinuos (ocultos)? Por lo tanto, definimos la siguiente medida de rendimiento δ para cuantificar los cambios en las puntuaciones de los mismos objetos web en diferentes foros web como δkl = Sim(Slk, Skl) - Sim(Slk ∗, Skl ∗) (10) donde Skl = (Skl 1, ..., Skl Ikl)T, Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1, ..., eSkl Ikl)T y Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b||. δkl > 0 significa que después de la fusión de puntuaciones, las puntuaciones en los mismos objetos web entre el k-ésimo y el l-ésimo foro web se vuelven más consistentes, lo cual es lo que esperamos. Por el contrario, si δkl < 0, esas puntuaciones se vuelven más inconsistentes. Aunque no podemos depender de esta medida para evaluar nuestros resultados finales de fusión, ya que clasificar fotos por su popularidad y cualidades es un proceso tan subjetivo que cada persona puede tener sus propios resultados, puede ayudarnos a comprender los resultados de clasificación intermedios y proporcionar información sobre el rendimiento final de diferentes métodos de clasificación. 2.6 Contrastes con Otros Trabajos Relacionados Ya hemos mencionado las diferencias de los métodos propuestos con los métodos tradicionales, como PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y los algoritmos de LinkFusion [27] en la Sección 1. Aquí discutimos algunas otras obras relacionadas. El problema actual también puede ser visto como un problema de agregación de rangos [13, 14] ya que tratamos con la cuestión de cómo combinar varias listas de rangos. Sin embargo, existen diferencias fundamentales entre ellos. En primer lugar, a diferencia de las páginas web, que pueden ser detectadas fácil y precisamente como las mismas páginas, detectar las mismas fotos en diferentes foros web es un trabajo no trivial, y solo puede ser implementado por algunos algoritmos delicados con cierta precisión y recuperación. Segundo, los números de las fotos duplicadas de diferentes foros web son pequeños en comparación con el total de conjuntos de fotos (ver Tabla 1). En otras palabras, las listas de clasificación de los K mejores de diferentes foros web son casi disjuntas para una consulta dada. Bajo esta condición, tanto los algoritmos propuestos en [13] como sus medidas - distancia de Kendall tau o distancia de la regla de Spearman - degenerarán en algunos casos triviales. Otra categoría de métodos de fusión de rangos (agregación) se basa en algoritmos de aprendizaje automático, como RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15] y RankNet [12]. Todos estos métodos implican algunos conjuntos de datos etiquetados para entrenar un modelo. En la configuración actual, es difícil o incluso imposible etiquetar estos conjuntos de datos según su nivel de profesionalismo o popularidad, ya que las fotos son demasiado vagas y subjetivas para clasificar. En cambio, el problema aquí es cómo combinar varias sub listas ordenadas para formar una lista de orden total. 3. EXPERIMENTOS En esta sección, llevamos a cabo nuestra investigación sobre la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. Primero presentamos brevemente el nuevo motor de búsqueda de imágenes verticales propuesto - EnjoyPhoto en la sección 3.1. Luego nos enfocamos en cómo clasificar fotos de diferentes foros web. Para hacerlo, primero normalizamos las puntuaciones (calificaciones) de las fotos de diferentes foros web múltiples en la sección 3.2. Luego intentamos encontrar fotos duplicadas en la sección 3.3. Algunos resultados intermedios se discuten utilizando la medida δ en la sección 3.4. Finalmente se lleva a cabo un conjunto de estudios de usuarios cuidadosamente para justificar nuestro método propuesto en la sección 3.5. 3.1 EnjoyPhoto: Motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad Para cumplir con el requisito de los usuarios de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, proponemos y construimos un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad - EnjoyPhoto, que aborda los siguientes tres problemas clave: 1. cómo rastrear e indexar fotos, 2. cómo determinar las cualidades de cada foto y 3. cómo mostrar los resultados de búsqueda para hacer que el proceso de búsqueda sea agradable. Para una consulta de texto dada, este sistema clasifica las fotos basándose en una cierta combinación de la relevancia de la foto para esta consulta (Problema 1) y la calidad de la foto (Problema 2), y finalmente las muestra de una manera agradable (Problema 3). En cuanto al tema 3, diseñamos la interfaz del sistema deliberadamente para facilitar el proceso de los usuarios al disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Técnicas como Fisheye y presentación de diapositivas son utilizadas en el sistema actual. La Figura 5 muestra la interfaz. No hablaremos más sobre este tema ya que no es un énfasis de este documento. Figura 5: EnjoyPhoto: un motor de búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad y agradable, donde se devuelven 26,477 registros para la consulta de otoño en aproximadamente 0.421 segundos. En cuanto al tema 1, extraímos de un motor de búsqueda comercial un subconjunto de fotos procedentes de varios foros de fotos de todo el mundo, y analizamos explícitamente las páginas web que contienen estas fotos. El número de fotos en la colección de datos es de aproximadamente 2.5 millones. Después del análisis, cada foto se asoció con su título, categoría, descripción, configuración de la cámara, datos EXIF 1 (cuando estuvieran disponibles para imágenes digitales), ubicación (cuando estuviera disponible en algunos foros de fotografía) y varios tipos de calificaciones. Todos estos metadatos son generalmente descripciones precisas o anotaciones para el contenido de la imagen, que luego son indexadas por tecnologías de búsqueda basadas en texto general [9, 18, 11]. En el sistema actual, la función de clasificación fue ajustada específicamente para enfatizar la información de título, categorización y calificación. El tema 2 se aborda esencialmente en las siguientes secciones, las cuales determinan la calidad de las fotos mediante el análisis de las calificaciones proporcionadas por varios foros de fotos en la web. Aquí elegimos seis foros de fotos para estudiar el problema de clasificación y los denominamos como Web-A, Web-B, Web-C, Web-D, Web-E y Web-F. 3.2 Normalización de Puntuaciones de Fotos Se analizan detalladamente diferentes métodos de normalización de puntuaciones en esta sección. En este análisis, las cámaras digitales zero 1 guardan archivos JPEG (.jpg) con datos EXIF (Exchangeable Image File). La configuración de la cámara y la información de la escena son registradas por la cámara en el archivo de imagen. www.digicamhelp.com/what-is-exif/ 382 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 6: Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones medias normalizadas a [0, 10] que suelen ocupar aproximadamente el 30% del número total de fotos en algunos foros web no se tienen en cuenta actualmente. Cómo utilizar estas fotos queda para futuras exploraciones. En la Figura 6, enumeramos las distribuciones de la puntuación media, la cual está transformada a un intervalo fijo [0, 10]. Las distribuciones de las puntuaciones promedio de estos foros web lucen bastante diferentes. Las distribuciones en las Figuras 6(a), 6(b) y 6(e) parecen distribuciones gaussianas, mientras que las de las Figuras 6(d) y 6(f) están dominadas por la puntuación más alta. La razón de estas distribuciones excéntricas para Web-D y Web-F radica en sus sistemas de calificación groseros. De hecho, Web-D y Web-F utilizan escalas de valoración de 2 o 3 puntos, mientras que otros foros web utilizan escalas de valoración de 7 u 14 puntos. Por lo tanto, será problemático si usamos directamente estos puntajes promediados. Además, es muy probable que la puntuación promedio sea manipulada si solo hay unos pocos usuarios calificando una foto. La Figura 7 muestra el método de normalización de puntuación total por puntajes máximos y mínimos, que es uno de nuestros sistemas de referencia. Todos los puntajes totales de un foro web dado se normalizan a [0, 100] de acuerdo con el puntaje máximo y mínimo del foro web correspondiente. Observamos que la distribución total de puntuaciones de Web-A en la Figura 7(a) tiene dos colas más grandes que todas las demás. Para mostrar la forma de las distribuciones de manera más clara, solo mostramos las distribuciones en [0, 25] en la Figura 7(b), 7(c), 7(d), 7(e) y 7(f). La Figura 8 muestra el método de normalización del Modo-Percentil 90%, donde los modos de las seis distribuciones se normalizan a 5 y el percentil 90% a 8. Podemos ver que este método de normalización hace que las distribuciones de las puntuaciones totales en diferentes foros sean más consistentes. Los dos algoritmos propuestos se basan en estos métodos de normalización. 3.3 Detección de fotos duplicadas. Dirigido a la eficiencia computacional, el algoritmo Dedup puede perder cierta tasa de recuperación, pero lograr una alta tasa de precisión. También nos enfocamos en encontrar enlaces ocultos precisos en lugar de todos los enlaces ocultos. La Figura 9 muestra algunos ejemplos de detección de duplicados. Los resultados se muestran en la Tabla 1 y verifican que existen grandes cantidades de fotos duplicadas en cualquier par de foros web, incluso con la estricta condición para la Deduplicación donde elegimos los primeros 29 bits como el código hash. Dado que solo hay unos pocos parámetros para estimar en los métodos de fusión propuestos, los números de fotos duplicadas mostrados en la Tabla 1 son 0 20 40 60 80 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 5 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 7: Normalización Maxmin 0 5 10 15 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (a) Web-A 0 5 10 15 0 1 2 3 4 5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (b) Web-B 0 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (c) Web-C 0 5 10 15 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (d) Web-D 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (e) Web-E 0 5 10 15 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 Puntuación Normalizada Número Total (f) Web-F Figura 8: Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90% suficiente para determinar estos parámetros. La última columna de la tabla lista el número total de fotos en los foros web correspondientes. 3.4 δ Medida Los parámetros de los algoritmos lineales y no lineales propuestos se calculan utilizando los datos duplicados mostrados en la Tabla 1, donde se elige Web-C como el foro web de referencia ya que comparte la mayoría de las fotos duplicadas con otros foros. Las tablas 2 y 3 muestran la medida δ en el modelo lineal y el modelo no lineal. Dado que δkl es simétrico y δkk = 0, solo mostramos la parte triangular superior. Los valores NaN en ambas tablas se encuentran en que no se han detectado fotos duplicadas por el algoritmo Dedup, como se informa en la Tabla 1. El modelo lineal garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la Tabla 1: Número de fotos duplicadas entre cada par de foros web A B C D E F Escala A 0 316 1,386 178 302 0 130k B 316 0 14,708 909 8,023 348 675k C 1,386 14,708 0 1,508 19,271 1,083 1,003k D 178 909 1,508 0 1,084 21 155k E 302 8,023 19,271 1,084 0 98 448k F 0 348 1,083 21 98 0 122k 383 Figura 9: Algunos resultados de la detección de fotos duplicadas Tabla 2: Medida δ en el modelo lineal. La comunidad de referencia debería ser teóricamente no menor a 0. Es, de hecho, el caso (ver los números subrayados en la Tabla 2). Pero este modelo no puede garantizar que las medidas de δ en las comunidades no referenciales también sean iguales o superiores a 0, ya que los pasos de normalización se basan en fotos duplicadas entre la comunidad de referencia y una comunidad no referencial. Los resultados muestran que todos los números en la medida δ son mayores que 0 (ver todos los números no subrayados en la Tabla 2), lo cual indica que es probable que este modelo dé resultados óptimos. Por el contrario, el modelo no lineal no garantiza que las medidas δ relacionadas con la comunidad de referencia deban ser no inferiores a 0, ya que no todas las fotos duplicadas entre los dos foros web pueden ser utilizadas al optimizar este modelo. De hecho, las fotos duplicadas que se encuentran en intervalos diferentes no serán utilizadas en este modelo. Son estas fotos duplicadas específicas las que hacen que la medida δ sea negativa. Como resultado, hay tanto elementos negativos como positivos en la Tabla 3, pero en general el número de positivos es mayor que el de negativos (9:5), lo que indica que el modelo puede ser mejor que el método de normalización únicamente (ver siguiente subsección) que tiene una medida δ completamente nula, y peor que el modelo lineal. 3.5 Estudio de Usuario Debido a que es difícil encontrar un criterio objetivo para evaluar la Tabla 3: medida δ en el modelo no lineal. Web-B Web-C Web-D Web-E Web-F Web-A 0.0559 0.0054 -0.0185 -0.0054 NaN Web-B - -0.0162 -0.0345 -0.0301 0.0466 Web-C - - 0.0136 0.0071 0.1264 Web-D - - - 0.0032 0.0143 Web-E - - - - 0.214 qué función de clasificación es mejor, optamos por realizar estudios de usuario para evaluaciones subjetivas. Diez sujetos fueron invitados a participar en el estudio de usuarios. Fueron reclutados de universidades cercanas. Dado que los motores de búsqueda de búsqueda de texto y búsqueda de imágenes son familiares para los estudiantes universitarios, no había un criterio previo para elegir a los estudiantes. Realizamos estudios de usuarios utilizando Internet Explorer 6.0 en Windows XP con monitores LCD de 17 pulgadas configurados en 1,280 píxeles por 1,024 píxeles en color de 32 bits. Los datos fueron registrados con registros del servidor y encuestas en papel después de cada tarea. Figura 10: Interfaz del estudio de usuario. Específicamente diseñamos una interfaz para el estudio de usuario como se muestra en la Figura 10. Para cada par de métodos de fusión, se alentó a los participantes a probar cualquier consulta que desearan. Para aquellos sin ideas específicas, se enumeraron dos cuadros combinados (lista de categorías y lista de consultas) en el panel inferior, donde se proporcionaron las 1,000 consultas de búsqueda de imágenes principales de un motor de búsqueda comercial. Después de que un participante envió una consulta, el sistema seleccionó aleatoriamente el marco izquierdo o derecho para mostrar cada uno de los dos resultados de clasificación. Los participantes debían luego juzgar cuál de los dos resultados de clasificación era mejor, o si los dos resultados de clasificación tenían la misma calidad, y enviar el juicio eligiendo el botón de radio correspondiente y haciendo clic en el botón de enviar. Por ejemplo, en la Figura 10, se envía la consulta \"sunset\" al sistema. Entonces, 79,092 fotos fueron devueltas y clasificadas por el método de fusión Minmax en el marco izquierdo y el método de fusión lineal en el marco derecho. Un participante luego compara los dos resultados de clasificación (sin conocer los métodos de clasificación) y envía sus comentarios eligiendo respuestas en la opción Tuya. Tabla 4: Resultados del estudio de usuario Norm. Solo Manual Lineal Lineal 29:13:10 14:22:15 No lineal 29:15:9 12:27:12 6:4:45 La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados experimentales, donde Lineal denota el método de fusión lineal, No lineal denota el método de fusión no lineal, Norm. Solo significa el método de normalización Maxmin, Manualmente significa el método ajustado manualmente. Los tres números en cada ítem, por ejemplo 29:13:10, significan que 29 juicios prefieren los resultados de fusión lineal, 10 384 juicios prefieren el método de normalización solamente, y 13 juicios consideran que estos dos métodos son equivalentes. Realizamos el análisis de ANOVA y obtenemos las siguientes conclusiones: 1. Tanto los métodos lineales como no lineales son significativamente mejores que la Norma. El único método con valores P respectivos de 0.00165 (< 0.05) y 0.00073 (<< 0.05). Este resultado es consistente con el resultado de la evaluación de la medida δ. La norma. El único método asume que las 10% mejores fotos en diferentes foros tienen la misma calidad. Sin embargo, esta suposición no se sostiene en general. Por ejemplo, una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de primer nivel generalmente tiene una calidad superior a una foto del top 10% en un foro de fotografía de segundo nivel. Esto es similar a eso, los estudiantes del 10% superior en una universidad de primer nivel y los de una universidad de segundo nivel suelen ser de diferente calidad. Tanto los métodos de fusión lineal como no lineal reconocen la existencia de tales diferencias y buscan cuantificarlas. Por lo tanto, ellos se desempeñan mejor que la norma. Único método. 2. El método de fusión lineal es significativamente mejor que el no lineal con un valor P de 1.195 × 10−10. Este resultado es bastante sorprendente ya que se espera que este método de clasificación más complicado ajuste la clasificación de manera más precisa que el lineal. La razón principal de este resultado puede ser que es difícil encontrar los mejores intervalos donde se debe llevar a cabo el ajuste no lineal y, sin embargo, simplemente se eligió la parte central del método de Normalización del Percentil del Modo-90%. Los métodos de evaluación que consumen mucho tiempo y son subjetivos - estudios de usuario - nos impidieron ajustar extensamente estos parámetros. 3. Los métodos lineales y no lineales propuestos tienen un rendimiento casi igual o ligeramente mejor que el método ajustado manualmente. Dado que los métodos de fusión lineal/no lineal son enfoques completamente automáticos, se consideran soluciones prácticas y eficientes cuando se necesite integrar más comunidades (por ejemplo, docenas de comunidades). 4. CONCLUSIONES Y TRABAJO FUTURO En este artículo, estudiamos el <br>problema de clasificación de objetos web</br> en los casos de falta de relaciones entre objetos donde los algoritmos de clasificación tradicionales ya no son válidos, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. Hemos construido un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical de alta calidad y propuesto métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas fuentes de datos (foros web) como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por el algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y minimizan las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son una solución práctica y eficiente para la clasificación de objetos web en las relaciones mencionadas. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros tipos de objetos web, incluyendo videoclips, poemas, cuentos cortos, música, dibujos, esculturas, y así sucesivamente. El sistema actual está lejos de ser perfecto. Para hacer este sistema más efectivo, se necesitan análisis más delicados para el dominio vertical (por ejemplo, foros de fotos en la web). Los siguientes puntos, por ejemplo, pueden mejorar los resultados de búsqueda y serán nuestro trabajo futuro: 1. un análisis más sutil y luego la utilización de diferentes tipos de calificaciones (por ejemplo, calificaciones de novedad, calificaciones estéticas); 2. diferenciar diversas comunidades que pueden tener diferentes intereses y preferencias o incluso entendimientos culturales distintos; 3. incorporar más información útil, incluida la información de fotógrafos y revisores, para modelar las fotos en un espacio de datos heterogéneo en lugar del actual homogéneo. Utilizaremos aún más el filtrado colaborativo para recomendar fotos relevantes de alta calidad a los navegadores. Un problema abierto es si podemos encontrar un criterio objetivo y eficiente para evaluar los resultados de clasificación, en lugar de emplear estudios de usuario subjetivos e ineficientes, que nos impidieron probar más algoritmos de clasificación y ajustar parámetros en un algoritmo.

                "In this paper, we study the <br>web object</br>-ranking problem, one of the key issues in building a vertical search engine.",
                "More specifically, we focus on this problem in cases when objects lack relationships between different Web communities, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "We proposed two score fusion methods that can automatically integrate as many Web communities (Web forums) with rating information as possible.",
                "The proposed fusion methods leverage the hidden links discovered by a duplicate photo detection algorithm, and aims at minimizing score differences of duplicate photos in different forums.",
                "Both intermediate results and user studies show the proposed fusion methods are practical and efficient solutions to <br>web object</br> ranking in cases we have described.",
                "Though the experiments were conducted on high-quality photo ranking, the proposed algorithms are also applicable to other ranking problems, such as movie ranking and music ranking.",
                "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and Retrieval; G.2.2 [Discrete Mathematics]: Graph Theory; H.3.5 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Online Information Services - Web-based services General Terms Algorithms, Experimentation 1.",
                "INTRODUCTION Despite numerous refinements and optimizations, general purpose search engines still fail to find relevant results for many queries.",
                "As a new trend, vertical search has shown promise because it can leverage domain-specific knowledge and is more effective in connecting users with the information they want.",
                "There are many vertical search engines, including some for paper search (e.g.",
                "Libra [21], Citeseer [7] and Google Scholar [4]), product search (e.g.",
                "Froogle [5]), movie search [6], image search [1, 8], video search [6], local search [2], as well as news search [3].",
                "We believe the vertical search engine trend will continue to grow.",
                "Essentially, building vertical search engines includes data crawling, information extraction, object identification and integration, and object-level Web information retrieval (or <br>web object</br> ranking) [20], among which ranking is one of the most important factors.",
                "This is because it deals with the core problem of how to combine and rank objects coming from multiple communities.",
                "Although object-level ranking has been well studied in building vertical search engines, there are still some kinds of vertical domains in which objects cannot be effectively ranked.",
                "For example, algorithms that evolved from PageRank [22], PopRank [21] and LinkFusion [27] were proposed to rank objects coming from multiple communities, but can only work on well-defined graphs of heterogeneous data.",
                "Well-defined means that like objects (e.g. authors in paper search) can be identified in multiple communities (e.g. conferences).",
                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",
                "However, this assumption does not always stand for some domains.",
                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",
                "Similar problems also exist in movie search and news search.",
                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",
                "We call such non-trivial object relationship in which identification is difficult, incomplete relationships.",
                "Other related work includes rank aggregation for the Web [13, 14], and learning algorithm for rank, such as RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19], and RankNet [12].",
                "We will contrast differences of these methods with the proposed methods after we have described the problem and our methods.",
                "We will specifically focus on <br>web object</br>-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for image search are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in image search, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to rank photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of <br>web object</br>-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each <br>web object</br>.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith <br>web object</br> (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",

                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de <br>objetos web</br>, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de <br>objetos web</br> en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información; G.2.2 [Matemáticas Discretas]: Teoría de Grafos; H.3.5 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Servicios de Información en Línea - Servicios basados en la web Términos Generales Algoritmos, Experimentación 1. A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o <br>clasificación de objetos web</br>) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de <br>objetos web</br> en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de búsqueda de imágenes son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la búsqueda de imágenes son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la búsqueda de imágenes, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de búsqueda de imágenes están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. Los usuarios aparentemente están interesados en disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad o buscar imágenes hermosas de lugares u otros tipos. Sin embargo, las necesidades de estos usuarios no son bien respaldadas por los motores de búsqueda de imágenes actuales debido a la dificultad del problema de evaluación de calidad. Idealmente, la parte más crítica de un motor de búsqueda, la función de clasificación, se puede simplificar como consistente en dos factores clave: relevancia y calidad. Para el factor de relevancia, las búsquedas en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes comerciales actuales proporcionan la mayoría de las imágenes devueltas que son bastante relevantes para las consultas, excepto por cierta ambigüedad. Sin embargo, en cuanto al factor de calidad, todavía no hay forma de asignar una clasificación óptima a una imagen. Aunque la evaluación de calidad de imagen basada en contenido ha sido investigada durante muchos años [23, 25, 26], todavía está lejos de estar lista para proporcionar una medida realista de calidad en un futuro inmediato. Aparentemente, realmente parece pesimista construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes que pueda cumplir con el potencialmente alto requisito de disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad. Varias comunidades web en crecimiento, sin embargo, nos indican que hoy en día las personas han creado y compartido una gran cantidad de fotos de alta calidad en la web sobre prácticamente cualquier tema, lo que proporciona una fuente rica para construir un motor de búsqueda de imágenes mejor. En general, las fotos de varios foros de fotografía son de mayor calidad que las fotos personales, y también son mucho más atractivas para los usuarios públicos que las fotos personales. Además, las fotos subidas a foros de fotografía generalmente requieren metadatos detallados sobre el título, la configuración de la cámara, la categoría y la descripción que deben ser proporcionados por los fotógrafos. Estos metadatos son en realidad las descripciones más precisas para las fotos y sin duda pueden ser indexados para ayudar a los motores de búsqueda a encontrar resultados relevantes. Más importante aún, hay usuarios voluntarios en comunidades web que proporcionan activamente valoraciones valiosas para estas fotos. La información de calificación suele ser de gran valor para resolver el problema de clasificación de calidad de fotos. Motivados por tales observaciones, hemos estado intentando construir un motor de búsqueda de fotos vertical extrayendo metadatos detallados e integrando información de varios foros web de fotos. En este artículo, nos enfocamos específicamente en cómo clasificar fotos de múltiples foros web. De manera intuitiva, las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes foros de fotografía pueden normalizarse empíricamente en función del número de fotos y el número de usuarios en cada foro. Sin embargo, este enfoque directo generalmente requiere un gran esfuerzo manual tanto en la ajuste tedioso de parámetros como en la evaluación subjetiva de resultados, lo que lo hace poco práctico cuando hay decenas o cientos de foros de fotos para combinar. Para abordar este problema, buscamos construir relaciones/enlaces entre diferentes foros de fotografía. Es decir, primero adoptamos un algoritmo eficiente para encontrar fotos duplicadas que pueden considerarse como enlaces ocultos que conectan múltiples foros. Luego formulamos el desafío de clasificación como un problema de optimización, lo que finalmente resulta en una función de clasificación óptima. 1.2 Principales Contribuciones y Organización. Las principales contribuciones de este artículo son: 1. Hemos propuesto y construido un motor de búsqueda de imágenes vertical aprovechando metadatos detallados de varios sitios web de foros de fotos para satisfacer las necesidades de los usuarios de buscar y disfrutar de fotos de alta calidad, lo cual es imposible en los motores de búsqueda de imágenes tradicionales. Hemos propuesto dos tipos de algoritmos de clasificación de <br>objetos web</br> para fotos con relaciones incompletas, que pueden integrar automáticamente y de manera eficiente tantas comunidades web como sea posible con información de calificación y lograr un resultado cualitativo igual al esquema de fusión ajustado manualmente.

                "This allows heterogeneous objects to be well linked to form a graph through leveraging all the relationships (e.g. cited-by, authored-by and published-by) among the multiple communities.",

                "High-quality photo search, movie search and news search are exceptions.",
                "For example, a photograph forum 377 website usually includes three kinds of objects: photos, authors and reviewers.",
                "Yet different photo forums seem to lack any relationships, as there are no cited-by relationships.",
                "This makes it difficult to judge whether two authors cited are the same author, or two photos are indeed identical photos.",
                "Consequently, although each photo has a rating score in a forum, it is non-trivial to rank photos coming from different photo forums.",

                "Although two movie titles can be identified as the same one by title and director in different movie discussion groups, it is non-trivial to combine rating scores from different discussion groups and rank movies effectively.",

                "We will specifically focus on Web object-ranking problem in cases that lack object relationships or have with incomplete object relationships, and take high-quality photo search as the test bed for this investigation.",
                "In the following, we will introduce rationale for building high-quality photo search. 1.1 High-Quality Photo Search In the past ten years, the Internet has grown to become an incredible resource, allowing users to easily access a huge number of images.",
                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to <br>image search</br> engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",
                "This is partially because user requirements for <br>image search</br> are far less than those for general text search.",
                "On the other hand, current commercial search engines still cannot well meet various user requirements, because there is no effective and practical solution to understand image content.",
                "To better understand user needs in <br>image search</br>, we conducted a query log analysis based on a commercial search engine.",
                "The result shows that more than 20% of <br>image search</br> queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current <br>image search</br> engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial <br>image search</br> engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal rank to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an <br>image search</br> engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better <br>image search</br> engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",

                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical <br>image search</br> engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional <br>image search</br> engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to rank other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to rank Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to rank photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",
                "The 85-dimensional features are transformed to a 32-dimensional vector, and the hash code is generated according to the signs.",
                "Figure 2: Hashing procedure for duplicate photo dectection 2.5 Score Fusion In this section, we will present two solutions on score fusion based on different parametric form assumptions of ψk in Eq. 1. 2.5.1 Linear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Intuitively, the most straightforward way to factor out the uncertainties caused by the different criterion is to scale, rel380 ative to a given center, the total scores of each unreferenced Web photo forum with respect to the reference forum.",
                "More strictly, we assume ψk has the following form ψk(Ski) = αkSki + tk, k = 2, ..., K (3) ψ1(S1i) = S1i (4) which means that the scores of k(= 1)th forum should be scaled by αk relative to the center tk 1−αk as shown in Figure 3.",
                "Then, if we substitute above ψk to Eq. 1, we get the following objective function, min {αk,tk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − αkSk1 i − tk i2 . (5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K. This is a linear fusion method.",
                "It enjoys simplicity and excellent performance in the following experiments.",
                "Figure 3: Linear Fusion method 2.5.2 Nonlinear Fusion by Duplicate Photos Sometimes we want a method which can adjust scores on intervals with two endpoints unchanged.",
                "As illustrated in Figure 4, the method can tune scores between [C0, C1] while leaving scores C0 and C1 unchanged.",
                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",
                "We intent to finely adjust the shape of the curves in each segment.",
                "Even there is no closed-form solution for the following optimization problem, min {αk|k∈[2,K]} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i h S1k i − ηM,T,α(Ski) i2 it is not hard to get the numeric one.",
                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the rank results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a rank aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several rank lists.",
                "However, there are fundamental differences between them.",
                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K rank lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of rank fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to rank.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música. Categorías y Descriptores de Asignaturas H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Búsqueda y Recuperación de Información; G.2.2 [Matemáticas Discretas]: Teoría de Grafos; H.3.5 [Almacenamiento y Recuperación de Información]: Servicios de Información en Línea - Servicios basados en la web Términos Generales Algoritmos, Experimentación 1. A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], <br>búsqueda de imágenes</br> [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para clasificar objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial clasificar las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y clasificar las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de rangos para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el rango, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. Contrastaremos las diferencias de estos métodos con los métodos propuestos después de haber descrito el problema y nuestros métodos. Nos enfocaremos específicamente en el problema de clasificación de objetos web en casos que carecen de relaciones entre objetos o tienen relaciones incompletas entre objetos, y tomaremos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como banco de pruebas para esta investigación. En lo siguiente, presentaremos la justificación para construir una búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad. 1.1 Búsqueda de Fotos de Alta Calidad En los últimos diez años, Internet ha crecido hasta convertirse en un recurso increíble, permitiendo a los usuarios acceder fácilmente a una gran cantidad de imágenes. Sin embargo, en comparación con las más de mil millones de imágenes indexadas por los motores de búsqueda comerciales, las consultas reales enviadas a los motores de <br>búsqueda de imágenes</br> son relativamente menores y representan solo el 8-10 por ciento del total de consultas de imágenes y texto enviadas a los motores de búsqueda comerciales [24]. Esto se debe en parte a que los requisitos de los usuarios para la <br>búsqueda de imágenes</br> son mucho menores que los de la búsqueda de texto general. Por otro lado, los motores de búsqueda comerciales actuales todavía no pueden satisfacer bien las diversas necesidades de los usuarios, ya que no existe una solución efectiva y práctica para comprender el contenido de las imágenes. Para comprender mejor las necesidades de los usuarios en la <br>búsqueda de imágenes</br>, realizamos un análisis de registros de consultas basado en un motor de búsqueda comercial. El resultado muestra que más del 20% de las consultas de <br>búsqueda de imágenes</br> están relacionadas con las categorías de naturaleza, lugares y vida diaria. ",

                "However, compared to the more than 1 billion images indexed by commercial search engines, actual queries submitted to image search engines are relatively minor, and occupy only 8-10 percent of total image and text queries submitted to commercial search engines [24].",

                "The result shows that more than 20% of image search queries are related to nature and places and daily life categories.",
                "Users apparently are interested in enjoying high-quality photos or searching for beautiful images of locations or other kinds.",
                "However, such user needs are not well supported by current image search engines because of the difficulty of the quality assessment problem.",
                "Ideally, the most critical part of a search engine - the ranking function - can be simplified as consisting of two key factors: relevance and quality.",
                "For the relevance factor, search in current commercial image search engines provide most returned images that are quite relevant to queries, except for some ambiguity.",
                "However, as to quality factor, there is still no way to give an optimal <br>rank</br> to an image.",
                "Though content-based image quality assessment has been investigated over many years [23, 25, 26], it is still far from ready to provide a realistic quality measure in the immediate future.",
                "Seemingly, it really looks pessimistic to build an image search engine that can fulfill the potentially large requirement of enjoying high-quality photos.",
                "Various proliferating Web communities, however, notices us that people today have created and shared a lot of high-quality photos on the Web on virtually any topics, which provide a rich source for building a better image search engine.",
                "In general, photos from various photo forums are of higher quality than personal photos, and are also much more appealing to public users than personal photos.",
                "In addition, photos uploaded to photo forums generally require rich metadata about title, camera setting, category and description to be provide by photographers.",
                "These metadata are actually the most precise descriptions for photos and undoubtedly can be indexed to help search engines find relevant results.",
                "More important, there are volunteer users in Web communities actively providing valuable ratings for these photos.",
                "The rating information is generally of great value in solving the photo quality ranking problem.",
                "Motivated by such observations, we have been attempting to build a vertical photo search engine by extracting rich metadata and integrating information form various photo Web forums.",
                "In this paper, we specifically focus on how to <br>rank</br> photos from multiple Web forums.",
                "Intuitively, the rating scores from different photo forums can be empirically normalized based on the number of photos and the number of users in each forum.",
                "However, such a straightforward approach usually requires large manual effort in both tedious parameter tuning and subjective results evaluation, which makes it impractical when there are tens or hundreds of photo forums to combine.",
                "To address this problem, we seek to build relationships/links between different photo forums.",
                "That is, we first adopt an efficient algorithm to find duplicate photos which can be considered as hidden links connecting multiple forums.",
                "We then formulate the ranking challenge as an optimization problem, which eventually results in an optimal ranking function. 1.2 Main Contributions and Organization.",
                "The main contributions of this paper are: 1.",
                "We have proposed and built a vertical image search engine by leveraging rich metadata from various photo forum Web sites to meet user requirements of searching for and enjoying high-quality photos, which is impossible in traditional image search engines. 2.",
                "We have proposed two kinds of Web object-ranking algorithms for photos with incomplete relationships, which can automatically and efficiently integrate as many as possible Web communities with rating information and achieves an equal qualitative result compared with the manually tuned fusion scheme.",
                "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we present in detail the proposed solutions to the ranking problem, including how to find hidden links between different forums, normalize rating scores, obtain the optimal ranking function, and contrast our methods with some other related research.",
                "In Section 3, we describe the experimental setting and experiments and user studies conducted to evaluate our algorithm.",
                "Our conclusion and a discussion of future work is in Section 4.",
                "It is worth noting that although we treat vertical photo search as the test bed in this paper, the proposed ranking algorithm can also be applied to <br>rank</br> other content that includes video clips, poems, short stories, drawings, sculptures, music, and so on. 378 2.",
                "ALGORITHM 2.1 Overview The difficulty of integrating multiple Web forums is in their different rating systems, where there are generally two kinds of freedom.",
                "The first kind of freedom is the rating interval or rating scale including the minimal and maximal ratings for each Web object.",
                "For example, some forums use a 5-point rating scale whereas other forums use 3-point or 10-point rating scales.",
                "It seems easy to fix this freedom, but detailed analysis of the data and experiments show that it is a non-trivial problem.",
                "The second kind of freedom is the varying rating criteria found in different Web forums.",
                "That is, the same score does not mean the same quality in different forums.",
                "Intuitively, if we can detect same photographers or same photographs, we can build relationships between any two photo forums and therefore can standardize the rating criterion by score normalization and transformation.",
                "Fortunately, we find that quite a number of duplicate photographs exist in various Web photo forums.",
                "This fact is reasonable when considering that photographers sometimes submit a photo to more than one forum to obtain critiques or in hopes of widespread publicity.",
                "In this work, we adopt an efficient duplicate photo detection algorithm [10] to find these photos.",
                "The proposed methods below are based on the following considerations.",
                "Faced with the need to overcome a ranking problem, a standardized rating criterion rather than a reasonable rating criterion is needed.",
                "Therefore, we can take a large scale forum as the reference forum, and align other forums by taking into account duplicate Web objects (duplicate photos in this work).",
                "Ideally, the scores of duplicate photos should be equal even though they are in different forums.",
                "Yet we can deem that scores in different forumsexcept for the reference forum - can vary in a parametric space.",
                "This can be determined by minimizing the objective function defined by the sum of squares of the score differences.",
                "By formulating the ranking problem as an optimization problem that attempts to make the scores of duplicate photos in non-reference forums as close as possible to those in the reference forum, we can effectively solve the ranking problem.",
                "For convenience, the following notations are employed.",
                "Ski and ¯Ski denote the total score and mean score of ith Web object (photo) in the kth Web site, respectively.",
                "The total score refers to the sum of the various rating scores (e.g., novelty rating and aesthetic rating), and the mean score refers to the mean of the various rating scores.",
                "Suppose there are a total of K Web sites.",
                "We further use {Skl i |i = 1, ..., Ikl; k, l = 1, ..., K; k = l} to denote the set of scores for Web objects (photos) in kth Web forums that are duplicate with the lth Web forums, where Ikl is the total number of duplicate Web objects between these two Web sites.",
                "In general, score fusion can be seen as the procedure of finding K transforms ψk(Ski) = eSki, k = 1, ..., K such that eSki can be used to <br>rank</br> Web objects from different Web sites.",
                "The objective function described in the above Figure 1: Web community integration.",
                "Each Web community forms a subgraph, and all communities are linked together by some hidden links (dashed lines). paragraph can then be formulated as min {ψk|k=2,...,K} KX k=2 Ik1X i=1 ¯wk i S1k i − ψk(Sk1 i ) 2 (1) where we use k = 1 as the reference forum and thus ψ1(S1i) = S1i. ¯wk i (≥ 0) is the weight coefficient that can be set heuristically according to the numbers of voters (reviewers or commenters) in both the reference forum and the non-reference forum.",
                "The more reviewers, the more popular the photo is and the larger the corresponding weight ¯wk i should be.",
                "In this work, we do not inspect the problem of how to choose ¯wk i and simply set them to one.",
                "But we believe the proper use of ¯wk i , which leverages more information, can significantly improve the results.",
                "Figure 1 illustrates the aforementioned idea.",
                "The Web Community 1 is the reference community.",
                "The dashed lines are links indicating that the two linked Web objects are actually the same.",
                "The proposed algorithm will try to find the best ψk(k = 2, ..., K), which has certain parametric forms according to certain models.",
                "So as to minimize the cost function defined in Eq. 1, the summation is taken on all the red dashed lines.",
                "We will first discuss the score normalization methods in Section 2.2, which serves as the basis for the following work.",
                "Before we describe the proposed ranking algorithms, we first introduce a manually tuned method in Section 2.3, which is laborious and even impractical when the number of communities become large.",
                "In Section 2.4, we will briefly explain how to precisely find duplicate photos between Web forums.",
                "Then we will describe the two proposed methods: Linear fusion and Non-linear fusion, and a performance measure for result evaluation in Section 2.5.",
                "Finally, in Section 2.6 we will discuss the relationship of the proposed methods with some other related work. 2.2 Score Normalization Since different Web (photo) forums on the Web usually have different rating criteria, it is necessary to normalize them before applying different kinds of fusion methods.",
                "In addition, as there are many kinds of ratings, such as ratings for novelty, ratings for aesthetics etc, it is reasonable to choose a common one - total score or average scorethat can always be extracted in any Web forum or calculated by corresponding ratings.",
                "This allows the normaliza379 tion method on the total score or average score to be viewed as an impartial rating method between different Web forums.",
                "It is straightforward to normalize average scores by linearly transforming them to a fixed interval.",
                "We call this kind of score as Scaled Mean Score.",
                "The difficulty, however, of using this normalization method is that, if there are only a few users rating an object, say a photo in a photo forum, the average score for the object is likely to be spammed or skewed.",
                "Total score can avoid such drawbacks that contain more information such as a Web objects quality and popularity.",
                "The problem is thus how to normalize total scores in different Web forums.",
                "The simplest way may be normalization by the maximal and minimal scores.",
                "The drawback of this normalization method is it is non robust, or in other words, it is sensitive to outliers.",
                "To make the normalization insensitive to unusual data, we propose the Mode-90% Percentile normalization method.",
                "Here, the mode score represents the total score that has been assigned to more photos than any other total score.",
                "And The high percentile score (e.g.,90%) represents the total score for which the high percentile of images have a lower total score.",
                "This normalization method utilizes the mode and 90% percentile as two reference points to align two rating systems, which makes the distributions of total scores in different forums more consistent.",
                "The underlying assumption, for example in different photo forums, is that even the qualities of top photos in different forums may vary greatly and be less dependent on the forum quality, the distribution of photos of middle-level quality (from mode to 90% percentile) should be almost of the same quality up to the freedom which reflects the rating criterion (strictness) of Web forums.",
                "Photos of this middle-level in a Web forum usually occupy more than 70 % of total photos in that forum.",
                "We will give more detailed analysis of the scores in Section 3.2. 2.3 Manual Fusion The Web movie forum, IMDB [16], proposed to use a Bayesian-ranking function to normalize rating scores within one community.",
                "Motivated by this ranking function, we propose this manual fusion method: For the kth Web site, we use the following formula eSki = αk · „ nk · ¯Ski nk + n∗ k + n∗ k · S∗ k nk + n∗ k « (2) to <br>rank</br> photos, where nk is the number of votes and n∗ k, S∗ k and αk are three parameters.",
                "This ranking function first takes a balance between the original mean score ¯Ski and a reference score S∗ k to get a weighted mean score which may be more reliable than ¯Ski.",
                "Then the weighted mean score is scaled by αk to get the final score fSki.",
                "For n Web communities, there are then about 3n parameters in {(αk, n∗ k, S∗ k)|k = 1, ..., n} to tune.",
                "Though this method can achieves pretty good results after careful and thorough manual tuning on these parameters, when n becomes increasingly large, say there are tens or hundreds of Web communities crawled and indexed, this method will become more and more laborious and will eventually become impractical.",
                "It is therefore desirable to find an effective fusion method whose parameters can be automatically determined. 2.4 Duplicate Photo Detection We use Dedup [10], an efficient and effective duplicate image detection algorithm, to find duplicate photos between any two photo forums.",
                "This algorithm uses hash function to map a high dimensional feature to a 32 bits hash code (see below for how to construct the hash code).",
                "Its computational complexity to find all the duplicate images among n images is about O(n log n).",
                "The low-level visual feature for each photo is extracted on k × k regular grids.",
                "Based on all features extracted from the image database, a PCA model is built.",
                "The visual features are then transformed to a relatively low-dimensional and zero mean PCA space, or 29 dimensions in our system.",
                "Then the hash code for each photo is built as follows: each dimension is transformed to one, if the value in this dimension is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise.",
                "Photos in the same bucket are deemed potential duplicates and are further filtered by a threshold in terms of Euclidean similarity in the visual feature space.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates the hashing procedure, where visual features - mean gray values - are extracted on both 6 × 6 and 7×7 grids.",

(5) By solving the following set of functions, ( ∂f ∂αk = = 0 ∂f ∂tk = 0 , k = 1, ..., K where f is the objective function defined in Eq. 5, we get the closed form solution as: „ αk tk « = A−1 k Lk (6) where Ak = „ P i ¯wi(Sk1 i )2 P i ¯wiSk1 iP i ¯wiSk1 i P i ¯wi « (7) Lk = „ P i ¯wiS1k i Sk1 iP i ¯wiS1k i « (8) and k = 2, ..., K.

                "This kind of fusion method is then much finer than the linear ones and contains many more parameters to tune and expect to further improve the results.",
                "Here, we propose a nonlinear fusion solution to satisfy such constraints.",
                "First, we introduce a transform: ηc0,c1,α(x) = ( x−c0 c1−c0 α (c1 − c0) + c0, if x ∈ (c0, c1] x otherwise where α > 0.",
                "This transform satisfies that for x ∈ [c0, c1], ηc0,c1,α(x) ∈ [c0, c1] with ηc0,c1,α(c0) = c0 and ηc0,c1,α(c1) = c1.",
                "Then we can utilize this nonlinear transform to adjust the scores in certain interval, say (M, T], ψk(Ski) = ηM,T,α(Ski) . (9) Figure 4: Nonlinear Fusion method.",

                "Under the same assumptions made in Section 2.2, we can use this method to adjust scores of the middle-level (from the mode point to the 90 % percentile).",
                "This more complicated non-linear fusion method is expected to achieve better results than the linear one.",
                "However, difficulties in evaluating the <br>rank</br> results block us from tuning these parameters extensively.",
                "The current experiments in Section 3.5 do not reveal any advantages over the simple linear model. 2.5.3 Performance Measure of the Fusion Results Since our objective function is to make the scores of the same Web objects (e.g. duplicate photos) between a nonreference forum and the reference forum as close as possible, it is natural to investigate how close they become to each other and how the scores of the same Web objects change between the two non-reference forums before and after score fusion.",
                "Taken Figure 1 as an example, the proposed algorithms minimize the score differences of the same Web objects in two Web forums: the reference forum (the Web Community 1) and a non-reference forum, which corresponds to minimizing the objective function on the red dashed (hidden) links.",
                "After the optimization, we must ask what happens to the score differences of the same Web objects in two nonreference forums?",
                "Or, in other words, whether the scores of two objects linked by the green dashed (hidden) links become more consistent?",
                "We therefore define the following performance measureδ measure - to quantify the changes for scores of the same Web objects in different Web forums as δkl = Sim(Slk , Skl ) − Sim(Slk ∗ , Skl ∗ ) (10) 381 where Skl = (Skl 1 , ..., Skl Ikl )T , Skl ∗ = (eSkl 1 , ..., eSkl Ikl )T and Sim(a, b) = a · b ||a||||b|| . δkl > 0 means after score fusion, scores on the same Web objects between kth and lth Web forum become more consistent, which is what we expect.",
                "On the contrary, if δkl < 0, those scores become more inconsistent.",
                "Although we cannot rely on this measure to evaluate our final fusion results as ranking photos by their popularity and qualities is such a subjective process that every person can have its own results, it can help us understand the intermediate ranking results and provide insights into the final performances of different ranking methods. 2.6 Contrasts with Other Related Work We have already mentioned the differences of the proposed methods with the traditional methods, such as PageRank [22], PopRank [21], and LinkFusion [27] algorithms in Section 1.",
                "Here, we discuss some other related works.",
                "The current problem can also be viewed as a <br>rank</br> aggregation one [13, 14] as we deal with the problem of how to combine several <br>rank</br> lists.",

                "First of all, unlike the Web pages, which can be easily and accurately detected as the same pages, detecting the same photos in different Web forums is a non-trivial work, and can only be implemented by some delicate algorithms while with certain precision and recall.",
                "Second, the numbers of the duplicate photos from different Web forums are small relative to the whole photo sets (see Table 1).",
                "In another words, the top K <br>rank</br> lists of different Web forums are almost disjointed for a given query.",
                "Under this condition, both the algorithms proposed in [13] and their measurements - Kendall tau distance or Spearman footrule distance - will degenerate to some trivial cases.",
                "Another category of <br>rank</br> fusion (aggregation) methods is based on machine learning algorithms, such as RankSVM [17, 19], RankBoost [15], and RankNet [12].",
                "All of these methods entail some labelled datasets to train a model.",
                "In current settings, it is difficult or even impossible to get these datasets labelled as to their level of professionalism or popularity, since the photos are too vague and subjective to <br>rank</br>.",
                "Instead, the problem here is how to combine several ordered sub lists to form a total order list. 3.",

En este artículo, estudiamos el problema de clasificación de objetos web, uno de los temas clave en la construcción de un motor de búsqueda vertical. Más específicamente, nos enfocamos en este problema en casos en los que los objetos carecen de relaciones entre diferentes comunidades web, y tomamos la búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad como campo de prueba para esta investigación. Propusimos dos métodos de fusión de puntuaciones que pueden integrar automáticamente tantas comunidades web (foros web) con información de calificación como sea posible. Los métodos de fusión propuestos aprovechan los enlaces ocultos descubiertos por un algoritmo de detección de fotos duplicadas, y tienen como objetivo minimizar las diferencias de puntuación de las fotos duplicadas en diferentes foros. Tanto los resultados intermedios como los estudios de usuario muestran que los métodos de fusión propuestos son soluciones prácticas y eficientes para la clasificación de objetos web en los casos que hemos descrito. Aunque los experimentos se realizaron en la clasificación de fotos de alta calidad, los algoritmos propuestos también son aplicables a otros problemas de clasificación, como la clasificación de películas y la clasificación de música.

A pesar de numerosos refinamientos y optimizaciones, los motores de búsqueda de propósito general siguen sin poder encontrar resultados relevantes para muchas consultas. Como una nueva tendencia, la búsqueda vertical ha demostrado ser prometedora porque puede aprovechar el conocimiento específico del dominio y es más efectiva para conectar a los usuarios con la información que desean. Hay muchos motores de búsqueda verticales, incluyendo algunos para la búsqueda de artículos (por ejemplo, Libra [21], Citeseer [7] y Google Scholar [4]), búsqueda de productos (por ejemplo, Froogle [5]), búsqueda de películas [6], búsqueda de imágenes [1, 8], búsqueda de videos [6], búsqueda local [2], así como búsqueda de noticias [3]. Creemos que la tendencia de los motores de búsqueda verticales seguirá creciendo. Básicamente, la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales incluye el rastreo de datos, la extracción de información, la identificación e integración de objetos, y la recuperación de información web a nivel de objeto (o clasificación de objetos web) [20], entre los cuales la clasificación es uno de los factores más importantes. Esto se debe a que trata el problema central de cómo combinar y <br>clasificar</br> objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades. Aunque la clasificación a nivel de objeto ha sido ampliamente estudiada en la construcción de motores de búsqueda verticales, todavía existen algunos tipos de dominios verticales en los que los objetos no pueden ser clasificados de manera efectiva. Por ejemplo, se propusieron algoritmos que evolucionaron a partir de PageRank [22], PopRank [21] y LinkFusion [27] para <br>clasificar</br> objetos provenientes de múltiples comunidades, pero solo pueden funcionar en grafos bien definidos de datos heterogéneos. Bien definido significa que objetos similares (por ejemplo, autores en la búsqueda de artículos) pueden ser identificados en múltiples comunidades (por ejemplo, conferencias). Esto permite que objetos heterogéneos estén bien vinculados para formar un grafo aprovechando todas las relaciones (por ejemplo, citado por, autorizado por y publicado por) entre las múltiples comunidades. Sin embargo, esta suposición no siempre se cumple en algunos dominios. La búsqueda de fotos de alta calidad, la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias son excepciones. Por ejemplo, un sitio web de foro de fotografías 377 generalmente incluye tres tipos de objetos: fotos, autores y revisores. Sin embargo, parece que los distintos foros de fotografía carecen de relaciones, ya que no hay relaciones citadas. Esto dificulta juzgar si dos autores citados son el mismo autor, o si dos fotos son realmente fotos idénticas. Por lo tanto, aunque cada foto tiene una puntuación de calificación en un foro, no es trivial <br>clasificar</br> las fotos provenientes de diferentes foros de fotografía. Problemas similares también existen en la búsqueda de películas y la búsqueda de noticias. Aunque dos títulos de películas pueden ser identificados como el mismo por título y director en diferentes grupos de discusión de películas, no es trivial combinar las puntuaciones de calificación de diferentes grupos de discusión y <br>clasificar</br> las películas de manera efectiva. Llamamos a tales relaciones de objetos no triviales en las que la identificación es difícil, relaciones incompletas. Otro trabajo relacionado incluye la agregación de <br>rango</br>s para la Web [13, 14], y algoritmos de aprendizaje para el <br>rango</br>, como RankBoost [15], RankSVM [17, 19] y RankNet [12]. ",
