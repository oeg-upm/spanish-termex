We observe the propagation of recommendations and the cascade sizes, which we explain by a simple stochastic model. We then establish how the recommendation network grows over time and how effective it is from the viewpoint of the sender and receiver of the recommendations. While on average recommendations are not very effective at inducing purchases and do not spread very far, we present a model that successfully identifies product and pricing categories for which viral marketing seems to be very effective.

INTRODUCTION With consumers showing increasing resistance to traditional forms of advertising such as TV or newspaper ads, marketers have turned to alternate strategies, including viral marketing. Viral marketing exploits existing social networks by encouraging customers to share product information with their friends. Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]). But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products. We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised viral marketing program. The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations. Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor influencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for advertisers to tap into. Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication. Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free. Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7]. Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral. Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way. At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a fat tail phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items. On Amazon.com, somewhere between 20 to 40 percent of unit sales fall outside of its top 100,000 ranked products [2]. Rhapsody, a streaming-music service, streams more tracks outside than inside its top 10,000 tunes [1]. Effectively advertising these niche products using traditional advertising approaches is impractical. Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the consumer, who would benefit from learning about new products. The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET. Quantitative marketing techniques have been proposed [12], and the rating of products and merchants has been shown to effect the likelihood of an item being bought [13, 4]. Of further help to the consumer are collaborative filtering recommendations of the form people who bought x also bought y feature [11]. These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative. It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions. Our friends are also acquainted with our needs and tastes, and can make appropriate recommendations. A Lucid Marketing survey found that 68% of individuals consulted friends and relatives before purchasing home electronics - more than the half who used search engines to find product information [3]. Several studies have attempted to model just this kind of network influence. Richardson and Domingos [14] used Epinions trusted reviewer network to construct an algorithm to maximize viral marketing efficiency assuming that individuals probability of purchasing a product depends on the opinions on the trusted peers in their network. Kempe, Kleinberg and Tardos [8] evaluate the efficiency of several algorithms for maximizing the size of influence set given various models of adoption. While these models address the question of maximizing the spread of influence in a network, they are based on assumed rather than measured influence effects. In contrast, in our study we are able to directly observe the effectiveness of person to person word of mouth advertising for hundreds of thousands of products for the first time. We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial purchase of a product. However, occasionally a product will propagate through a very active recommendation network. We propose a simple stochastic model that seems to explain the propagation of recommendations. Moreover, the characteristics of recommendation networks influence the purchase patterns of their members. For example, individuals likelihood of purchasing a product initially increases as they receive additional recommendations for it, but a saturation point is quickly reached. Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases. We also propose models to identify products for which viral marketing is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often. We also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are likely to be shopping online or reading email. We report on these and other findings in the following sections. 2. THE RECOMMENDATION NETWORK 2.1 Dataset description Our analysis focuses on the recommendation referral program run by a large retailer. The program rules were as follows. Each time a person purchases a book, music, or a movie he or she is given the option of sending emails recommending the item to friends. The first person to purchase the same item through a referral link in the email gets a 10% discount. When this happens the sender of the recommendation receives a 10% credit on their purchase. The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users. The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003. In total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos. In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailers website to obtain product categories, reviews and ratings for all products. Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them). Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations. The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor. We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product. The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products. The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program. Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation. The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves. Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product. Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 Recommendation network statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the product and product price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount. The sender and receiver IDs were shadowed. We represent this data set as a directed multi graph. The nodes represent customers, and a directed edge contains all the information about the recommendation. The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended product p to customer j at time t. The typical process generating edges in the recommendation network is as follows: a node i first buys a product p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn. The j nodes can they buy the product and further recommend it. The only way for a node to recommend a product is to first buy it. Note that even if all nodes j buy a product, only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase (within a week after the recommendation) will be marked by a buy-bit. Because the buy-bit is set only for the first person who acts on a recommendation, we identify additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations must be preceded by a purchase. We call this type of evidence of purchase a buyedge. Note that buy-edges provide only a lower bound on the total number of purchases without discounts. It is possible for a customer to not be the first to act on a recommendation and also to not recommend the product to others. Unfortunately, this was not recorded in the data set. We consider, however, the buy-bits and buy-edges as proxies for the total number of purchases through recommendations. For each product group we took recommendations on all products from the group and created a network.

The inset shows the linear growth in the number of customers n over time. (b) The number of recommendations sent by a user with each curve representing a different depth of the user in the recommendation chain. A power law exponent γ is fitted to all but the tail. (first 7 columns) shows the sizes of various product group recommendation networks with p being the total number of products in the product group, n the total number of nodes spanned by the group recommendation network and e the number of edges (recommendations). The column eu shows the number of unique edges - disregarding multiple recommendations between the same source and recipient. In terms of the number of different items, there are by far the most music CDs, followed by books and videos. There is a surprisingly small number of DVD titles. On the other hand, DVDs account for more half of all recommendations in the dataset. The DVD network is also the most dense, having about 10 recommendations per node, while books and music have about 2 recommendations per node and videos have only a bit more than 1 recommendation per node. Music recommendations reached about the same number of people as DVDs but used more than 5 times fewer recommendations to achieve the same coverage of the nodes. Book recommendations reached by far the most people - 2.8 million. Notice that all networks have a very small number of unique edges. For books, videos and music the number of unique edges is smaller than the number of nodes - this suggests that the networks are highly disconnected [5]. Figure 1(a) shows the fraction of nodes in largest weakly connected component over time. Notice the component is very small. Even if we compose a network using all the recommendations in the dataset, the largest connected component contains less than 2.5% (100,420) of the nodes, and the second largest component has only 600 nodes. Still, some smaller communities, numbering in the tens of thousands of purchasers of DVDs in categories such as westerns, classics and Japanese animated films (anime), had connected components spanning about 20% of their members. The insert in figure 1(a) shows the growth of the customer base over time. Surprisingly it was linear, adding on average 165,000 new users each month, which is an indication that the service itself was not spreading epidemically. Further evidence of non-viral spread is provided by the relatively high percentage (94%) of users who made their first recommendation without having previously received one. Back to table 1: given the total number of recommendations e and purchases (bb + be) influenced by recommendations we can estimate how many recommendations need to be independently sent over the network to induce a new purchase. Using this metric books have the most influential recommendations followed by DVDs and music. For books one out of 69 recommendations resulted in a purchase. For DVDs it increases to 108 recommendations per purchase and further increases to 136 for music and 203 for video. Even with these simple counts we can make the first few observations. It seems that some people got quite heavily involved in the recommendation program, and that they tended to recommend a large number of products to the same set of friends (since the number of unique edges is so small). This shows that people tend to buy more DVDs and also like to recommend them to their friends, while they seem to be more conservative with books. One possible reason is that a book is bigger time investment than a DVD: one usually needs several days to read a book, while a DVD can be viewed in a single evening. One external factor which may be affecting the recommendation patterns for DVDs is the existence of referral websites (www.dvdtalk.com). On these websites people, who want to buy a DVD and get a discount, would ask for recommendations. This way there would be recommendations made between people who dont really know each other but rather have an economic incentive to cooperate. We were not able to find similar referral sharing sites for books or CDs. 2.3 Forward recommendations Not all people who make a purchase also decide to give recommendations. So we estimate what fraction of people that purchase also decide to recommend forward. To obtain this information we can only use the nodes with purchases that resulted in a discount. The last 3 columns of table 1 show that only about a third of the people that purchase also recommend the product forward. The ratio of forward recommendations is much higher for DVDs than for other kinds of products. Videos also have a higher ratio of forward recommendations, while books have the lowest. This shows that people are most keen on recommending movies, while more conservative when recommending books and music. Figure 1(b) shows the cumulative out-degree distribution, that is the number of people who sent out at least kp recommendations, for a product. It shows that the deeper an individual is in the cascade, if they choose to make recommendations, they tend to recommend to a greater number of people on average (the distribution has a higher variance). This effect is probably due to only very heavily recommended products producing large enough cascades to reach a certain depth. We also observe that the probability of an individual making a recommendation at all (which can only occur if they make a purchase), declines after an initial increase as one gets deeper into the cascade. 2.4 Identifying cascades As customers continue forwarding recommendations, they contribute to the formation of cascades. In order to identify cascades, i.e. the causal propagation of recommendations, we track successful recommendations as they influence purchases and further recommendations. We define a recommendation to be successful if it reached a node before its first purchase. We consider only the first purchase of an item, because there are many cases when a person made multiple 230 Group p n e eu bb be Purchases Forward Percent Book 103,161 2,863,977 5,741,611 2,097,809 65,344 17,769 65,391 15,769 24.2 DVD 19,829 805,285 8,180,393 962,341 17,232 58,189 16,459 7,336 44.6 Music 393,598 794,148 1,443,847 585,738 7,837 2,739 7,843 1,824 23.3 Video 26,131 239,583 280,270 160,683 909 467 909 250 27.6 Total 542,719 3,943,084 15,646,121 3,153,676 91,322 79,164 90,602 25,179 27.8 Table 1: Product group recommendation statistics. p: number of products, n: number of nodes, e: number of edges (recommendations), eu: number of unique edges, bb: number of buy bits, be: number of buy edges.

In this case one cannot conclude that recommendations following the first purchase influenced the later purchases. Each cascade is a network consisting of customers (nodes) who purchased the same product as a result of each others recommendations (edges). We delete late recommendations - all incoming recommendations that happened after the first purchase of the product. This way we make the network time increasing or causal - for each node all incoming edges (recommendations) occurred before all outgoing edges. Now each connected component represents a time obeying propagation of recommendations. Figure 2 shows two typical product recommendation networks: (a) a medical study guide and (b) a Japanese graphic novel. Throughout the dataset we observe very similar patters. Most product recommendation networks consist of a large number of small disconnected components where we do not observe cascades. Then there is usually a small number of relatively small components with recommendations successfully propagating. This observation is reflected in the heavy tailed distribution of cascade sizes (see figure 4), having a power-law exponent close to 1 for DVDs in particular. We also notice bursts of recommendations (figure 2(b)). Some nodes recommend to many friends, forming a star like pattern. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the recommendations and purchases made by a single node in the recommendation network. Notice the power-law distributions and long flat tails. The most active person made 83,729 recommendations and purchased 4,416 different items. Finally, we also sometimes observe collisions, where nodes receive recommendations from two or more sources. A detailed enumeration and analysis of observed topological cascade patterns for this dataset is made in [10]. 2.5 The recommendation propagation model A simple model can help explain how the wide variance we observe in the number of recommendations made by individuals can lead to power-laws in cascade sizes (figure 4). The model assumes that each recipient of a recommendation will forward it to others if its value exceeds an arbitrary threshold that the individual sets for herself. Since exceeding this value is a probabilistic event, lets call pt the probability that at time step t the recommendation exceeds the thresh231 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 0 10 2 10 4 10 6 = 1.8e6 x−4.98 R2 =0.99 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 0 10 2 10 4 = 3.4e3 x−1.56 R2 =0.83 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 0 10 2 10 4 = 4.9e5 x−6.27 R2 =0.97 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 0 10 2 10 4 = 7.8e4 x−5.87 R2 =0.97 (a) Book (b) DVD (c) Music (d) Video Figure 4: Size distribution of cascades (size of cascade vs. count). Bold line presents a power-fit. old. In that case the number of recommendations Nt+1 at time (t + 1) is given in terms of the number of recommendations at an earlier time by Nt+1 = ptNt (1) where the probability pt is defined over the unit interval. Notice that, because of the probabilistic nature of the threshold being exceeded, one can only compute the final distribution of recommendation chain lengths, which we now proceed to do. Subtracting from both sides of this equation the term Nt and diving by it we obtain N(t+1) − Nt Nt = pt − 1 (2) Summing both sides from the initial time to some very large time T and assuming that for long times the numerator is smaller than the denominator (a reasonable assumption) we get dN N = pt (3) The left hand integral is just ln(N), and the right hand side is a sum of random variables, which in the limit of a very large uncorrelated number of recommendations is normally distributed (central limit theorem). This means that the logarithm of the number of messages is normally distributed, or equivalently, that the number of messages passed is log-normally distributed. In other words the probability density for N is given by P(N) = 1 N √ 2πσ2 exp −(ln(N) − μ)2 2σ2 (4) which, for large variances describes a behavior whereby the typical number of recommendations is small (the mode of the distribution) but there are unlikely events of large chains of recommendations which are also observable. Furthermore, for large variances, the lognormal distribution can behave like a power law for a range of values. In order to see this, take the logarithms on both sides of the equation (equivalent to a log-log plot) and one obtains ln(P(N)) = − ln(N) − ln( √ 2πσ2) − (ln (N) − μ)2 2σ2 (5) So, for large σ, the last term of the right hand side goes to zero, and since the the second term is a constant one obtains a power law behavior with exponent value of minus one. There are other models which produce power-law distributions of cascade sizes, but we present ours for its simplicity, since it does not depend on network topology [6] or critical thresholds in the probability of a recommendation being accepted [18]. 3. SUCCESS OF RECOMMENDATIONS So far we only looked into the aggregate statistics of the recommendation network. Next, we ask questions about the effectiveness of recommendations in the recommendation network itself. First, we analyze the probability of purchasing as one gets more and more recommendations. Next, we measure recommendation effectiveness as two people exchange more and more recommendations. Lastly, we observe the recommendation network from the perspective of the sender of the recommendation. Does a node that makes more recommendations also influence more purchases? 3.1 Probability of buying versus number of incoming recommendations First, we examine how the probability of purchasing changes as one gets more and more recommendations. One would expect that a person is more likely to buy a product if she gets more recommendations. On the other had one would also think that there is a saturation point - if a person hasnt bought a product after a number of recommendations, they are not likely to change their minds after receiving even more of them. So, how many recommendations are too many? Figure 5 shows the probability of purchasing a product as a function of the number of incoming recommendations on the product. As we move to higher numbers of incoming recommendations, the number of observations drops rapidly. For example, there were 5 million cases with 1 incoming recommendation on a book, and only 58 cases where a person got 20 incoming recommendations on a particular book. The maximum was 30 incoming recommendations. For these reasons we cut-off the plot when the number of observations becomes too small and the error bars too large. Figure 5(a) shows that, overall, book recommendations are rarely followed. Even more surprisingly, as more and more recommendations are received, their success decreases. We observe a peak in probability of buying at 2 incoming recommendations and then a slow drop. For DVDs (figure 5(b)) we observe a saturation around 10 incoming recommendations. This means that after a person gets 10 recommendations on a particular DVD, they become immune to them - their probability of buying does not increase anymore. The number of observations is 2.5 million at 1 incoming recommendation and 100 at 60 incoming recommendations. The maximal number of received recommendations is 172 (and that person did not buy) 232 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 Incoming Recommendations ProbabilityofBuying 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 Incoming Recommendations ProbabilityofBuying (a) Books (b) DVD Figure 5: Probability of buying a book (DVD) given a number of incoming recommendations. 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 4 6 8 10 12 x 10 −3 Exchanged recommendations Probabilityofbuying 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 Exchanged recommendations Probabilityofbuying (a) Books (b) DVD Figure 6: The effectiveness of recommendations with the total number of exchanged recommendations. 3.2 Success of subsequent recommendations Next, we analyze how the effectiveness of recommendations changes as two persons exchange more and more recommendations. A large number of exchanged recommendations can be a sign of trust and influence, but a sender of too many recommendations can be perceived as a spammer. A person who recommends only a few products will have her friends attention, but one who floods her friends with all sorts of recommendations will start to loose her influence. We measure the effectiveness of recommendations as a function of the total number of previously exchanged recommendations between the two nodes. We construct the experiment in the following way. For every recommendation r on some product p between nodes u and v, we first determine how many recommendations were exchanged between u and v before recommendation r. Then we check whether v, the recipient of recommendation, purchased p after recommendation r arrived. For the experiment we consider only node pairs (u, v), where there were at least a total of 10 recommendations sent from u to v. We perform the experiment using only recommendations from the same product group. Figure 6 shows the probability of buying as a function of the total number of exchanged recommendations between two persons up to that point. For books we observe that the effectiveness of recommendation remains about constant up to 3 exchanged recommendations. As the number of exchanged recommendations increases, the probability of buying starts to decrease to about half of the original value and then levels off. For DVDs we observe an immediate and consistent drop. This experiment shows that recommendations start to lose effect after more than two or three are passed between two people. We performed the experiment also for video and music, but the number of observations was too low and the measurements were noisy. 3.3 Success of outgoing recommendations In previous sections we examined the data from the viewpoint of the receiver of the recommendation. Now we look from the viewpoint of the sender. The two interesting questions are: how does the probability of getting a 10% credit change with the number of outgoing recommendations; and given a number of outgoing recommendations, how many purchases will they influence? One would expect that recommendations would be the most effective when recommended to the right subset of friends. If one is very selective and recommends to too few friends, then the chances of success are slim. One the other hand, recommending to everyone and spamming them with recommendations may have limited returns as well. The top row of figure 7 shows how the average number of purchases changes with the number of outgoing recommendations. For books, music, and videos the number of purchases soon saturates: it grows fast up to around 10 outgoing recommendations and then the trend either slows or starts to drop. DVDs exhibit different behavior, with the expected number of purchases increasing throughout. But if we plot the probability of getting a 10% credit as a function of the number of outgoing recommendations, as in the bottom row of figure 7, we see that the success of DVD recommendations saturates as well, while books, videos and music have qualitatively similar trends. The difference in the curves for DVD recommendations points to the presence of collisions in the dense DVD network, which has 10 recommendations per node and around 400 per product - an order of magnitude more than other product groups. This means that many different individuals are recommending to the same person, and after that person makes a purchase, even though all of them made a successful recommendation 233 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Outgoing Recommendations NumberofPurchases 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Outgoing Recommendations NumberofPurchases 5 10 15 20 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 Outgoing Recommendations NumberofPurchases 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 Outgoing Recommendations NumberofPurchases 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 Outgoing Recommendations ProbabilityofCredit 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 Outgoing Recommendations ProbabilityofCredit 5 10 15 20 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 Outgoing Recommendations ProbabilityofCredit 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 Outgoing Recommendations ProbabilityofCredit (a) Books (b) DVD (c) Music (d) Video Figure 7: Top row: Number of resulting purchases given a number of outgoing recommendations.

TIMING OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND PURCHASES The recommendation referral program encourages people to purchase as soon as possible after they get a recommendation, since this maximizes the probability of getting a discount. We study the time lag between the recommendation and the purchase of different product groups, effectively how long it takes a person to both receive a recommendation, consider it, and act on it. We present the histograms of the thinking time, i.e. the difference between the time of purchase and the time the last recommendation was received for the product prior to the purchase (figure 8). We use a bin size of 1 day. Around 35%40% of book and DVD purchases occurred within a day after the last recommendation was received. For DVDs 16% purchases occur more than a week after last recommendation, while this drops to 10% for books. In contrast, if we consider the lag between the purchase and the first recommendation, only 23% of DVD purchases are made within a day, while the proportion stays the same for books. This reflects a greater likelihood for a person to receive multiple recommendations for a DVD than for a book. At the same time, DVD recommenders tend to send out many more recommendations, only one of which can result in a discount. Individuals then often miss their chance of a discount, which is reflected in the high ratio (78%) of recommended DVD purchases that did not a get discount (see table 1, columns bb and be). In contrast, for books, only 21% of purchases through recommendations did not receive a discount. We also measure the variation in intensity by time of day for three different activities in the recommendation system: recommendations (figure 9(a)), all purchases (figure 9(b)), and finally just the purchases which resulted in a discount (figure 9(c)). Each is given as a total count by hour of day. The recommendations and purchases follow the same pattern. The only small difference is that purchases reach a sharper peak in the afternoon (after 3pm Pacific Time, 6pm Eastern time). The purchases that resulted in a discount look like a negative image of the first two figures. This means that most of discounted purchases happened in the morning when the traffic (number of purchases/recommendations) on the retailers website was low. This makes a lot of sense since most of the recommendations happened during the day, and if the person wanted to get the discount by being the first one to purchase, she had the highest chances when the traffic on the website was the lowest. 5. RECOMMENDATION EFFECTIVENESS BY BOOK CATEGORY Social networks are a product of the contexts that bring people together. Some contexts result in social ties that are more effective at conducting an action. For example, in small world experiments, where participants attempt to reach a target individual through their chain of acquaintances, profession trumped geography, which in turn was more useful in locating a target than attributes such as religion or hobbies [9, 17]. In the context of product recommendations, we can ask whether a recommendation for a work of fiction, which may be made by any friend or neighbor, is 234 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 5 Hour of the Day Recommendtions 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 4 Hour of the Day AllPurchases 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 Hour of the Day DiscountedPurchases (a) Recommendations (b) Purchases (c) Purchases with Discount Figure 9: Time of day for purchases and recommendations. (a) shows the distribution of recommendations over the day, (b) shows all purchases and (c) shows only purchases that resulted in getting discount. more or less influential than a recommendation for a technical book, which may be made by a colleague at work or school. Table 2 shows recommendation trends for all top level book categories by subject. An analysis of other product types can be found in the extended version of the paper. For clarity, we group the results by 4 different category types: fiction, personal/leisure, professional/technical, and nonfiction/other. Fiction encompasses categories such as Sci-Fi and Romance, as well as childrens and young adult books. Personal/Leisure encompasses everything from gardening, photography and cooking to health and religion. First, we compare the relative number of recommendations to reviews posted on the site (column cav/rp1 of table 2). Surprisingly, we find that the number of people making personal recommendations was only a few times greater than the number of people posting a public review on the website. We observe that fiction books have relatively few recommendations compared to the number of reviews, while professional and technical books have more recommendations than reviews. This could reflect several factors. One is that people feel more confident reviewing fiction than technical books. Another is that they hesitate to recommend a work of fiction before reading it themselves, since the recommendation must be made at the point of purchase. Yet another explanation is that the median price of a work of fiction is lower than that of a technical book. This means that the discount received for successfully recommending a mystery novel or thriller is lower and hence people have less incentive to send recommendations. Next, we measure the per category efficacy of recommendations by observing the ratio of the number of purchases occurring within a week following a recommendation to the number of recommenders for each book subject category (column b of table 2). On average, only 2% of the recommenders of a book received a discount because their recommendation was accepted, and another 1% made a recommendation that resulted in a purchase, but not a discount. We observe marked differences in the response to recommendation for different categories of books. Fiction in general is not very effectively recommended, with only around 2% of recommenders succeeding. The efficacy was a bit higher (around 3%) for non-fiction books dealing with personal and leisure pursuits, but is significantly higher in the professional and technical category. Medical books have nearly double the average rate of recommendation acceptance. This could be in part attributed to the higher median price of medical books and technical books in general. As we will see in Section 6, a higher product price increases the chance that a recommendation will be accepted. Recommendations are also more likely to be accepted for certain religious categories: 4.3% for Christian living and theology and 4.8% for Bibles. In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower recommendation effectiveness. These results raise the interesting possibility that individuals have greater influence over one another in an organized context, for example through a professional contact or a religious one. There are exceptions of course. For example, Japanese anime DVDs have a strong following in the US, and this is reflected in their frequency and success in recommendations. Another example is that of gardening. In general, recommendations for books relating to gardening have only a modest chance of being accepted, which agrees with the individual prerogative that accompanies this hobby. At the same time, orchid cultivation can be a highly organized and social activity, with frequent shows and online communities devoted entirely to orchids. Perhaps because of this, the rate of acceptance of orchid book recommendations is twice as high as those for books on vegetable or tomato growing. 6. MODELING THE RECOMMENDATION SUCCESS We have examined the properties of recommendation network in relation to viral marketing, but one question still remains: what determines the products viral marketing success? We present a model which characterizes product categories for which recommendations are more likely to be accepted. We use a regression of the following product attributes to correlate them with recommendation success: • r: number of recommendations • ns: number of senders of recommendations • nr: number of recipients of recommendations • p: price of the product • v: number of reviews of the product • t: average product rating 235 category np n cc rp1 vav cav/ pm b ∗ 100 rp1 Books general 370230 2,860,714 1.87 5.28 4.32 1.41 14.95 3.12 Fiction Childrens Books 46,451 390,283 2.82 6.44 4.52 1.12 8.76 2.06** Literature & Fiction 41,682 502,179 3.06 13.09 4.30 0.57 11.87 2.82* Mystery and Thrillers 10,734 123,392 6.03 20.14 4.08 0.36 9.60 2.40** Science Fiction & Fantasy 10,008 175,168 6.17 19.90 4.15 0.64 10.39 2.34** Romance 6,317 60,902 5.65 12.81 4.17 0.52 6.99 1.78** Teens 5,857 81,260 5.72 20.52 4.36 0.41 9.56 1.94** Comics & Graphic Novels 3,565 46,564 11.70 4.76 4.36 2.03 10.47 2.30* Horror 2,773 48,321 9.35 21.26 4.16 0.44 9.60 1.81** Personal/Leisure Religion and Spirituality 43,423 441,263 1.89 3.87 4.45 1.73 9.99 3.13 Health Mind and Body 33,751 572,704 1.54 4.34 4.41 2.39 13.96 3.04 History 28,458 28,3406 2.74 4.34 4.30 1.27 18.00 2.84 Home and Garden 19,024 180,009 2.91 1.78 4.31 3.48 15.37 2.26** Entertainment 18,724 258,142 3.65 3.48 4.29 2.26 13.97 2.66* Arts and Photography 17,153 179,074 3.49 1.56 4.42 3.85 20.95 2.87 Travel 12,670 113,939 3.91 2.74 4.26 1.87 13.27 2.39** Sports 10,183 120,103 1.74 3.36 4.34 1.99 13.97 2.26** Parenting and Families 8,324 182,792 0.73 4.71 4.42 2.57 11.87 2.81 Cooking Food and Wine 7,655 146,522 3.02 3.14 4.45 3.49 13.97 2.38* Outdoors & Nature 6,413 59,764 2.23 1.93 4.42 2.50 15.00 3.05 Professional/Technical Professional & Technical 41,794 459,889 1.72 1.91 4.30 3.22 32.50 4.54** Business and Investing 29,002 476,542 1.55 3.61 4.22 2.94 20.99 3.62** Science 25,697 271,391 2.64 2.41 4.30 2.42 28.00 3.90** Computers and Internet 18,941 375,712 2.22 4.51 3.98 3.10 34.95 3.61** Medicine 16,047 175,520 1.08 1.41 4.40 4.19 39.95 5.68** Engineering 10,312 107,255 1.30 1.43 4.14 3.85 59.95 4.10** Law 5,176 53,182 2.64 1.89 4.25 2.67 24.95 3.66* Nonfiction-other Nonfiction 55,868 560,552 2.03 3.13 4.29 1.89 18.95 3.28** Reference 26,834 371,959 1.94 2.49 4.19 3.04 17.47 3.21 Biographies and Memoirs 18,233 277,356 2.80 7.65 4.34 0.90 14.00 2.96 Table 2: Statistics by book category: np:number of products in category, n number of customers, cc percentage of customers in the largest connected component, rp1 av. # reviews in 2001 - 2003, rp2 av. # reviews 1st 6 months 2005, vav average star rating, cav average number of people recommending product, cav/rp1 ratio of recommenders to reviewers, pm median price, b ratio of the number of purchases resulting from a recommendation to the number of recommenders. The symbol ** denotes statistical significance at the 0.01 level, * at the 0.05 level. From the original set of half a million products, we compute a success rate s for the 48,218 products that had at least one purchase made through a recommendation and for which a price was given. In section 5 we defined recommendation success rate s as the ratio of the total number purchases made through recommendations and the number of senders of the recommendations. We decided to use this kind of normalization, rather than normalizing by the total number of recommendations sent, in order not to penalize communities where a few individuals send out many recommendations (figure 2(b)). Since the variables follow a heavy tailed distribution, we use the following model: s = exp( i βi log(xi) + i) where xi are the product attributes (as described on previous page), and i is random error. We fit the model using least squares and obtain the coefficients βi shown on table 3. With the exception of the average rating, they are all significant. The only two attributes with a positive coefficient are the number of recommendations and price. This shows that more expensive and more recommended products have a higher success rate. The number of senders and receivers have large negative coefficients, showing that successfully recommended products are more likely to be not so widely popular. They have relatively many recommendations with a small number of senders and receivers, which suggests a very dense recommendation network where lots of recommendations were exchanged between a small community of people. These insights could be to marketers - personal recommendations are most effective in small, densely connected communities enjoying expensive products. 236 Variable Coefficient βi const -0.940 (0.025)** r 0.426 (0.013)** ns -0.782 (0.004)** nr -1.307 (0.015)** p 0.128 (0.004)** v -0.011 (0.002)** t -0.027 (0.014)* R2 0.74 Table 3: Regression using the log of the recommendation success rate, ln(s), as the dependent variable.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Although the retailer may have hoped to boost its revenues through viral marketing, the additional purchases that resulted from recommendations are just a drop in the bucket of sales that occur through the website. Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling. Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact. Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction. Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of. Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold. In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection. Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability. This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want. In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role. For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people. But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does. In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network. As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines. This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know. We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps. We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship. Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing. So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread. 8.

Observamos la propagación de las recomendaciones y los tamaños en cascada, que explicamos mediante un modelo estocástico simple. Luego establecemos cómo la red de recomendaciones crece con el tiempo y cuán efectiva es desde el punto de vista del remitente y el receptor de las recomendaciones. Si bien, en promedio, las recomendaciones no son muy efectivas para inducir compras y no nos extendemos muy lejos, presentamos un modelo que identifica con éxito categorías de productos y precios para las cuales el marketing viral parece ser muy efectivo. Categorías y descriptores de sujetos J.4 [Ciencias Sociales y del Comportamiento]: Economía Términos generales Economía 1. Introducción Con los consumidores que muestran una resistencia creciente a las formas tradicionales de publicidad, como anuncios de TV o periódicos, los especialistas en marketing han recurrido a estrategias alternativas, incluido el marketing viral. El marketing viral explota las redes sociales existentes al alentar a los clientes a compartir información de productos con sus amigos. Anteriormente, algunos estudios en profundidad han demostrado que las redes sociales afectan la adopción de innovaciones y productos individuales (para una revisión, ver [15] o [16]). Pero hasta hace poco ha sido difícil medir cuán influyentes son las recomendaciones de persona a persona en una amplia gama de productos. Pudimos medir y modelar directamente la efectividad de las recomendaciones mediante el estudio de un programa de marketing viral incentivado por los minoristas en línea. El sitio web dio descuentos a los clientes que recomendaron cualquiera de sus productos a otros, y luego rastreó las compras resultantes y las recomendaciones adicionales. Aunque el boca a boca puede ser un factor poderoso que influye en las decisiones de compra, puede ser difícil que los anunciantes aprovechen. Algunos servicios utilizados por las personas para comunicarse son candidatos naturales para el marketing viral, porque el producto se puede observar o anunciar como parte de la comunicación. Los servicios de correo electrónico como Hotmail y Yahoo tenían curvas de adopción muy rápidas porque cada correo electrónico enviado a través de ellas contenía un anuncio para el servicio y porque eran gratuitos. Hotmail gastó solo $ 50,000 en marketing tradicional y aún creció de cero a 12 millones de usuarios en 18 meses [7]. Googles Gmail capturó una parte importante de la cuota de mercado a pesar del hecho de que la única forma de registrarse en el servicio fue a través de una referencia. La mayoría de los productos no se pueden anunciar de una manera tan directa. Al mismo tiempo, la elección de los productos disponibles para los consumidores ha aumentado muchas veces gracias a los minoristas en línea que pueden proporcionar una variedad mucho más amplia de productos que las tiendas tradicionales de ladrillo y mortero. La variedad de productos no solo es más grande, sino que uno observa un fenómeno de cola de grasa, donde una gran fracción de compras son de artículos relativamente oscuros. En Amazon.com, entre el 20 y el 40 por ciento de las ventas de la unidad quedan fuera de sus 100,000 productos clasificados [2]. Rhapsody, un servicio de música de transmisión, transmite más pistas afuera que dentro de sus 10,000 canciones principales [1]. La publicidad efectiva de estos productos de nicho utilizando enfoques publicitarios tradicionales no es práctico. Por lo tanto, usar enfoques de marketing más específicos es ventajoso tanto para el comerciante como para el consumidor, quien se beneficiaría de aprender sobre nuevos productos. El problema se aborda en parte por el advenimiento de los productos en línea y las reseñas de comerciantes, tanto en sitios minoristas como eBay y Amazon, como sitios de comparación de productos especializados como Epinions y CNET. Se han propuesto técnicas de marketing cuantitativas [12], y se ha demostrado que la calificación de productos y comerciantes efectúa la probabilidad de que se compre un artículo [13, 4]. De más ayuda para el consumidor son las recomendaciones de filtrado colaborativo de la forma que las personas que compraron X también compraron y la función [11]. Estos refinamientos ayudan a los consumidores a descubrir nuevos productos 228 y reciben evaluaciones más precisas, pero no pueden sustituir completamente las recomendaciones personalizadas que uno recibe de un amigo o pariente. Es la naturaleza humana estar más interesado en lo que compra un amigo que lo que una persona anónima compra, tener más probabilidades de confiar en su opinión y estar más influenciado por sus acciones. Nuestros amigos también están familiarizados con nuestras necesidades y gustos, y pueden hacer recomendaciones apropiadas. Una encuesta de marketing lúcido encontró que el 68% de las personas consultó a amigos y familiares antes de comprar productos electrónicos para el hogar, más que la mitad que usó motores de búsqueda para encontrar información del producto [3]. Varios estudios han intentado modelar solo este tipo de influencia de la red. Richardson y Domingos [14] utilizaron Epinions Trusted Reviewer Network para construir un algoritmo para maximizar la eficiencia de marketing viral, suponiendo que las personas probabilidad de comprar un producto dependa de las opiniones de los pares de confianza en su red. Kempe, Kleinberg y Tardos [8] evalúan la eficiencia de varios algoritmos para maximizar el tamaño de la influencia establecido dados varios modelos de adopción. Si bien estos modelos abordan la cuestión de maximizar la propagación de la influencia en una red, se basan en efectos de influencia asumidos en lugar de medidos. Por el contrario, en nuestro estudio podemos observar directamente la efectividad de la persona a la persona que anuncia el boca a boca para cientos de miles de productos por primera vez. Encontramos que la mayoría de las cadenas de recomendación no crecen muy grandes, a menudo terminan con la compra inicial de un producto. Sin embargo, ocasionalmente un producto se propagará a través de una red de recomendaciones muy activa. Proponemos un modelo estocástico simple que parece explicar la propagación de las recomendaciones. Además, las características de las redes de recomendaciones influyen en los patrones de compra de sus miembros. Por ejemplo, la probabilidad de los individuos de comprar un producto aumenta inicialmente a medida que reciben recomendaciones adicionales para él, pero se alcanza rápidamente un punto de saturación. Curiosamente, a medida que se envían más recomendaciones entre los mismos dos individuos, la probabilidad de que sean atendidas disminuyen. También proponemos modelos para identificar productos para los cuales el marketing viral es efectivo: encontramos que la categoría y el precio del producto juegan un papel, con recomendaciones de productos costosos de interés para las comunidades pequeñas y bien conectadas que resultan en una compra con más frecuencia. También observamos patrones en el momento de las recomendaciones y las compras correspondientes a las horas del día en que las personas probablemente están comprando en línea o leyendo el correo electrónico. Informamos sobre estos y otros hallazgos en las siguientes secciones.2. La red de recomendaciones 2.1 DataSet Descripción Nuestro análisis se centra en el programa de referencia de recomendación administrado por un gran minorista. Las reglas del programa fueron las siguientes. Cada vez que una persona compra un libro, música o una película, se le da la opción de enviar correos electrónicos que recomiendan el artículo a los amigos. La primera persona en comprar el mismo artículo a través de un enlace de referencia en el correo electrónico tiene un descuento del 10%. Cuando esto sucede, el remitente de la recomendación recibe un crédito del 10% en su compra. El conjunto de datos de recomendación consta de 15,646,121 recomendaciones hechas entre 3,943,084 usuarios distintos. Los datos se recopilaron del 5 de junio de 2001 al 16 de mayo de 2003. En total, se recomendaron 548,523 productos, el 99% de ellos pertenecían a 4 grupos principales de productos: libros, DVD, música y videos. Además de los datos de recomendación, también arrastramos el sitio web de los minoristas para obtener categorías de productos, revisiones y calificaciones para todos los productos. De los productos en nuestro conjunto de datos, se suspendieron 5813 (1%) (el minorista ya no proporcionó ninguna información sobre ellos). Aunque los datos nos brindan una visión detallada y precisa de la dinámica de recomendación, tiene sus limitaciones. La única indicación del éxito de una recomendación es la observación del destinatario que compra el producto a través del mismo proveedor. No tenemos forma de saber si la persona había decidido comprar en otro lugar, pedir prestado o obtener el producto. La entrega de la recomendación también es algo diferente de una persona que simplemente cuenta con otra sobre un producto que disfrutan, posiblemente en el contexto de una discusión más amplia de productos similares. La recomendación se recibe como un correo electrónico del formulario que incluye información sobre el programa de descuento. Alguien que lea el correo electrónico podría considerarlo spam, o al menos considerarlo menos importante que una recomendación dada en el contexto de una conversación. El destinatario también puede dudar de si el amigo está recomendando el producto porque cree que el destinatario podría disfrutarlo o simplemente está tratando de obtener un descuento para sí mismos. Finalmente, debido a que la recomendación tiene lugar antes de que el recomendador reciba el producto, es posible que no se base en una observación directa del producto. Sin embargo, creemos que estas redes de recomendaciones reflejan la naturaleza de la publicidad de boca en boca y nos dan ideas clave sobre la influencia de las redes sociales en las decisiones de compra.2.2 Estadísticas de red de recomendación Para cada recomendación, el conjunto de datos incluía el precio del producto y el producto, la identificación del remitente, la identificación del receptor, la fecha de envío y una compra, lo que indica si la recomendación resultó en una compra y descuento. El remitente y las identificaciones del receptor fueron sombreadas. Representamos este conjunto de datos como un gráfico múltiple dirigido. Los nodos representan a los clientes, y un borde dirigido contiene toda la información sobre la recomendación. El borde (i, j, p, t) indica que recomendé el producto P al cliente J en el momento t.Los bordes de generación de procesos típicos en la red de recomendaciones es el siguiente: un nodo que primero compra un producto P en el momento t y luego lo recomienda a los nodos J1 ,..., Jn. Los nodos J pueden comprar el producto y lo recomiendan. La única forma de que un nodo recomiende un producto es comprarlo primero. Tenga en cuenta que incluso si todos los nodos J compran un producto, solo la ventaja del nodo JK que realizó la compra (dentro de una semana después de la recomendación) estará marcada por una compra. Debido a que la compra se establece solo para la primera persona que actúa por recomendación, identificamos compras adicionales por la presencia de recomendaciones salientes para una persona, ya que todas las recomendaciones deben ser precedidas por una compra. Llamamos a este tipo de evidencia de compra una compra. Tenga en cuenta que los bordes de compra proporcionan solo un límite inferior en el número total de compras sin descuentos. Es posible que un cliente no sea el primero en actuar por recomendación y también no recomendar el producto a otros. Desafortunadamente, esto no se registró en el conjunto de datos. Sin embargo, consideramos que los bits y los bordes de compra como proxies para el número total de compras a través de recomendaciones. Para cada grupo de productos tomamos recomendaciones sobre todos los productos del grupo y creamos una red.

Un exponente de la ley de poder se ajusta a todos menos a la cola.(las primeras 7 columnas) muestra los tamaños de varias redes de recomendación de grupos de productos, ya que P es el número total de productos en el grupo de productos, el número total de nodos abarcados por la red de recomendaciones del grupo y el número de bordes (recomendaciones). La UE de la columna muestra el número de bordes únicos, sin tener en cuenta múltiples recomendaciones entre la misma fuente y el receptor. En términos de la cantidad de artículos diferentes, hay, con mucho, la mayoría de los CD de música, seguidos de libros y videos. Hay un número sorprendentemente pequeño de títulos de DVD. Por otro lado, los DVD representan más la mitad de todas las recomendaciones en el conjunto de datos. La red DVD también es la más densa, que tiene aproximadamente 10 recomendaciones por nodo, mientras que los libros y la música tienen aproximadamente 2 recomendaciones por nodo y los videos tienen solo un poco más de 1 recomendación por nodo. Las recomendaciones musicales alcanzaron el mismo número de personas que los DVD, pero usaron más de 5 veces menos recomendaciones para lograr la misma cobertura de los nodos. Las recomendaciones de libros llegaron con mucho la mayoría de las personas: 2.8 millones. Observe que todas las redes tienen un número muy pequeño de bordes únicos. Para libros, videos y música, el número de bordes únicos es menor que el número de nodos; esto sugiere que las redes están altamente desconectadas [5]. La Figura 1 (a) muestra la fracción de nodos en un componente más grande y conectado con el tiempo. Observe que el componente es muy pequeño. Incluso si componemos una red utilizando todas las recomendaciones en el conjunto de datos, el componente conectado más grande contiene menos del 2.5% (100,420) de los nodos, y el segundo componente más grande tiene solo 600 nodos. Aún así, algunas comunidades más pequeñas, que numeran en las decenas de miles de compradores de DVD en categorías, como westerns, clásicos y películas animadas japonesas (anime), habían conectado componentes que abarcaban aproximadamente el 20% de sus miembros. El inserto en la Figura 1 (a) muestra el crecimiento de la base de clientes a lo largo del tiempo. Sorprendentemente, fue lineal, y agregó en promedio 165,000 nuevos usuarios cada mes, lo cual es una indicación de que el servicio en sí no se estaba extendiendo epidemamente. El porcentaje relativamente alto (94%) de los usuarios que hicieron su primera recomendación sin haber recibido una. Volver a la Tabla 1: Dado el número total de recomendaciones E y compras (BB + BE) influenciadas por recomendaciones, podemos estimar cuántas recomendaciones deben enviarse de forma independiente a través de la red para inducir una nueva compra. El uso de estos libros métricos tiene las recomendaciones más influyentes seguidas de DVD y música. Para libros, una de las 69 recomendaciones dio como resultado una compra. Para los DVD aumenta a 108 recomendaciones por compra y aumenta aún más a 136 para música y 203 para video. Incluso con estos recuentos simples podemos hacer las primeras observaciones. Parece que algunas personas se involucraron bastante en el programa de recomendación, y que tendieron a recomendar una gran cantidad de productos al mismo conjunto de amigos (ya que la cantidad de bordes únicos es muy pequeño). Esto muestra que las personas tienden a comprar más DVD y también les gusta recomendarlos a sus amigos, mientras que parecen ser más conservadores con los libros. Una posible razón es que un libro es una inversión de tiempo más grande que un DVD: uno generalmente necesita varios días para leer un libro, mientras que un DVD se puede ver en una sola noche. Un factor externo que puede estar afectando los patrones de recomendación para DVD es la existencia de sitios web de referencia (www.dvdtalk.com). En estos sitios web, las personas, que desean comprar un DVD y obtener un descuento, pedirían recomendaciones. De esta manera, se harían recomendaciones entre las personas que realmente no se conocen, sino que tienen un incentivo económico para cooperar. No pudimos encontrar sitios de compartimiento de referencia similares para libros o CD.2.3 Recomendaciones de avance No todas las personas que realizan una compra también deciden dar recomendaciones. Por lo tanto, estimamos qué fracción de personas que compran también deciden recomendar. Para obtener esta información, solo podemos usar los nodos con compras que resultaron en un descuento. Las últimas 3 columnas de la Tabla 1 muestran que solo alrededor de un tercio de las personas que compran también recomiendan el producto. La relación de recomendaciones hacia adelante es mucho mayor para DVD que para otros tipos de productos. Los videos también tienen una mayor proporción de recomendaciones hacia adelante, mientras que los libros tienen el más bajo. Esto muestra que las personas están más interesadas en recomendar películas, mientras que más conservadoras al recomendar libros y música. La Figura 1 (b) muestra la distribución acumulada de grado externo, es decir, el número de personas que enviaron al menos las recomendaciones de KP, para un producto. Muestra que cuanto más profundo es un individuo en la cascada, si eligen hacer recomendaciones, tienden a recomendar a un mayor número de personas en promedio (la distribución tiene una mayor variación). Este efecto probablemente se deba a que solo los productos muy recomendados producen cascadas lo suficientemente grandes como para alcanzar una cierta profundidad. También observamos que la probabilidad de que un individuo haga una recomendación (que solo puede ocurrir si realizan una compra), disminuye después de un aumento inicial a medida que se profundiza en la cascada.2.4 Identificación de cascadas a medida que los clientes continúan enviando recomendaciones, contribuyen a la formación de cascadas. Para identificar cascadas, es decir, la propagación causal de las recomendaciones, rastreamos las recomendaciones exitosas a medida que influyen en las compras y nuevas recomendaciones. Definimos una recomendación para tener éxito si alcanzó un nodo antes de su primera compra. Consideramos solo la primera compra de un artículo, porque hay muchos casos en los que una persona realizó múltiples 230 grupos P n e UU BB de compras porcentaje de porcentaje 103,161 2,863,977 5,741,611 2,097,809 65,344 17,769 65,391 15,769 24.2 DVD 19,829 8055585 8,180,130,130,17,17,17,118 SED. 232 58,189 16,459 7,336 44.6 Música393,598 794,148 1,443,847 585,738 7,837 2,739 7,843 1,824 23.3 Video 26,131 239,583 280,270 160,683 909 467 909 250 27.6 Total 542,719 3,9433,084 15,121,124,124,124,121 3,153,121 3,153,144,151 44,64,1M.121 44,124,1M.153,ATO14,153.151 44,144,1MATRIR 6 91,322 79,164 90,602 25,179 27.8 Tabla 1: Estadísticas de recomendación del grupo de productos.P: Número de productos, N: Número de nodos, E: Número de bordes (recomendaciones), UE: Número de bordes únicos, BB: Número de bits de compra, BE: Número de bordes de compra.

En este caso, uno no puede concluir que las recomendaciones después de la primera compra influyeron en las compras posteriores. Cada cascada es una red que consta de clientes (nodos) que compraron el mismo producto como resultado de las recomendaciones (bordes) de los demás. Eliminamos recomendaciones tardías, todas las recomendaciones entrantes que ocurrieron después de la primera compra del producto. De esta manera, hacemos que el tiempo de red aumente o cause, para cada nodo, todos los bordes entrantes (recomendaciones) ocurrieron antes de todos los bordes salientes. Ahora cada componente conectado representa un tiempo obedeciendo la propagación de recomendaciones. La Figura 2 muestra dos redes de recomendación de productos típicas: (a) una guía de estudio médico y (b) una novela gráfica japonesa. A lo largo del conjunto de datos observamos patrones muy similares. La mayoría de las redes de recomendación de productos consisten en una gran cantidad de pequeños componentes desconectados donde no observamos cascadas. Luego, generalmente hay un pequeño número de componentes relativamente pequeños con recomendaciones que se propagan con éxito. Esta observación se refleja en la distribución de cola pesada de los tamaños de cascada (ver Figura 4), que tiene un exponente de la ley de potencia cerca de 1 para DVD en particular. También notamos explosiones de recomendaciones (Figura 2 (b)). Algunos nodos recomiendan a muchos amigos, formando un patrón de estrella. La Figura 3 muestra la distribución de las recomendaciones y compras realizadas por un solo nodo en la red de recomendaciones. Observe las distribuciones de la ley de potencia y las largas colas planas. La persona más activa hizo 83,729 recomendaciones y compró 4.416 artículos diferentes. Finalmente, a veces también observamos colisiones, donde los nodos reciben recomendaciones de dos o más fuentes. En [10] se realiza una enumeración y análisis detallados de los patrones de cascada topológicos observados para este conjunto de datos.2.5 El modelo de propagación de recomendación Un modelo simple puede ayudar a explicar cómo la amplia varianza que observamos en el número de recomendaciones hechas por los individuos puede conducir a las leyes de potencia en los tamaños de cascada (Figura 4). El modelo supone que cada destinatario de una recomendación lo enviará a otros si su valor excede un umbral arbitrario que el individuo se establece para sí misma. Dado que exceder este valor es un evento probabilístico, llamemos a PT la probabilidad de que en el paso de tiempo T la recomendación excede el Thresh231 10 0 10 10 1 10 2 10 0 10 2 10 4 10 6 = 1.8e6 x - 4.98 R2 = 0.99 10 0 10 10 10 10 101 10 2 10 3 10 0 10 2 10 4 = 3.4E3 X - 1.56 R2 = 0.83 10 0 10 10 1 10 2 10 0 10 2 10 4 = 4.9E5 X - 6.27 R2 = 0.97 10 0 10 10 10 10 0 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 102 10 4 = 7.8e4 x - 5.87 R2 = 0.97 (a) Libro (b) DVD (C) Música (D) Video Figura 4: Distribución de tamaño de cascadas (tamaño de cascada frente a recuento). Bold Line presenta un ajuste de potencia.viejo. En ese caso, el número de recomendaciones NT+1 en el momento (t+1) se da en términos del número de recomendaciones en un momento anterior por NT+1 = PTNT (1) donde la probabilidad PT se define a través del intervalo unitario. Tenga en cuenta que, debido a la naturaleza probabilística del umbral que se excede, uno solo puede calcular la distribución final de las longitudes de la cadena de recomendación, lo que ahora procedemos a hacer. Restando de ambos lados de esta ecuación el término nt y buceo por él obtenemos n (t+1) - nt nt = pt - 1 (2) sumando ambos lados desde el tiempo inicial hasta un tiempo muy grande T y suponiendo que durante mucho tiempo durante mucho tiempoveces el numerador es más pequeño que el denominador (una suposición razonable) obtenemos dn n = pt (3) la integral de la mano izquierda es solo ln (n), y el lado derecho es una suma de variables aleatorias, que en el límite deUn número muy grande de recomendaciones no se distribuye normalmente (teorema del límite central). Esto significa que el logaritmo del número de mensajes normalmente se distribuye, o de manera equivalente, que el número de mensajes pasados se distribuye logmalmente. En otras palabras, la densidad de probabilidad para N viene dada por p (n) = 1 n √ 2πσ2 exp - (ln (n) - μ) 2 2σ2 (4) que, para grandes variaciones, describe un comportamiento por el cual el número típico de recomendaciones esPequeño (el modo de distribución) pero hay eventos poco probables de grandes cadenas de recomendaciones que también son observables. Además, para grandes variaciones, la distribución lognormal puede comportarse como una ley de poder para un rango de valores. Para ver esto, tome los logaritmos en ambos lados de la ecuación (equivalente a un gráfico de log-log) y uno obtiene ln (p (n)) =-ln (n)-ln (√ 2πσ2)-(ln ((ln (N) - μ) 2 2σ2 (5) Entonces, para σ grande, el último término del lado derecho va a cero, y dado que el segundo término es constante obtiene un comportamiento de la ley de potencia con el valor exponente de menos uno. Hay otros modelos que producen distribuciones de la ley de potencia de los tamaños de cascada, pero presentamos nuestros para su simplicidad, ya que no depende de la topología de la red [6] o los umbrales críticos en la probabilidad de que se acepte una recomendación [18].3. El éxito de las recomendaciones hasta ahora solo analizamos las estadísticas agregadas de la red de recomendaciones. A continuación, hacemos preguntas sobre la efectividad de las recomendaciones en la red de recomendaciones en sí. Primero, analizamos la probabilidad de comprar a medida que se obtiene cada vez más recomendaciones. A continuación, medimos la efectividad de la recomendación a medida que dos personas intercambian cada vez más recomendaciones. Por último, observamos la red de recomendaciones desde la perspectiva del remitente de la recomendación. ¿Un nodo que hace más recomendaciones también influye en más compras?3.1 Probabilidad de compra versus número de recomendaciones entrantes Primero, examinamos cómo la probabilidad de cambiar la compra a medida que una obtiene cada vez más recomendaciones. Uno esperaría que una persona tenga más probabilidades de comprar un producto si recibe más recomendaciones. Por otro lado, uno también pensaría que hay un punto de saturación: si una persona no ha comprado un producto después de una serie de recomendaciones, no es probable que cambie de opinión después de recibir aún más de ellas. Entonces, ¿cuántas recomendaciones son demasiadas? La Figura 5 muestra la probabilidad de comprar un producto en función del número de recomendaciones entrantes en el producto. A medida que avanzamos a un mayor número de recomendaciones entrantes, el número de observaciones disminuye rápidamente. Por ejemplo, hubo 5 millones de casos con 1 recomendación entrante en un libro, y solo 58 casos en los que una persona obtuvo 20 recomendaciones entrantes en un libro en particular. El máximo fue de 30 recomendaciones entrantes. Por estas razones, cortamos la trama cuando el número de observaciones se vuelve demasiado pequeña y las barras de error demasiado grandes. La Figura 5 (a) muestra que, en general, las recomendaciones de libros rara vez se siguen. Aún más sorprendente, a medida que se reciben más y más recomendaciones, su éxito disminuye. Observamos un pico con probabilidad de comprar en 2 recomendaciones entrantes y luego una caída lenta. Para DVD (Figura 5 (b)) observamos una saturación alrededor de 10 recomendaciones entrantes. Esto significa que después de que una persona recibe 10 recomendaciones en un DVD en particular, se vuelve inmune a ellas: su probabilidad de comprar ya no aumenta. El número de observaciones es de 2.5 millones en 1 recomendación entrante y 100 en 60 recomendaciones entrantes. El número máximo de recomendaciones recibidas es 172 (y esa persona no compró) 232 2 4 6 8 10 0 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 Recomendaciones entrantes Probabilidad de la construcción de 10 20 30 40 50 60 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 Recomendaciones entrantes Probabilidad de la combinación(b) DVD Figura 5: Probabilidad de comprar un libro (DVD) dadas una serie de recomendaciones entrantes.5 10 15 20 20 25 30 35 40 4 6 8 10 12 x 10 −3 Recomendaciones intercambiadas probabilidad de construcción 5 10 15 15 20 25 30 35 40 0.02 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 0.07 Recomendaciones intercambiadas probabilidad de combustión (a) libros (b) DVD Figura 6: El efectividad: el efectividadde recomendaciones con el número total de recomendaciones intercambiadas.3.2 éxito de las recomendaciones posteriores A continuación, analizamos cómo la efectividad de las recomendaciones cambia a medida que dos personas intercambian cada vez más recomendaciones. Una gran cantidad de recomendaciones intercambiadas pueden ser un signo de confianza e influencia, pero un remitente de demasiadas recomendaciones puede percibirse como un spammer. Una persona que solo recomienda unos pocos productos tendrá atención a sus amigos, pero uno que inunda a sus amigos con todo tipo de recomendaciones comenzará a perder su influencia. Medimos la efectividad de las recomendaciones en función del número total de recomendaciones intercambiadas previamente entre los dos nodos. Construimos el experimento de la siguiente manera. Para cada recomendación R en algún producto P entre los nodos U y V, primero determinamos cuántas recomendaciones se intercambiaron entre U y V antes de la recomendación r.Luego verificamos si V, el destinatario de recomendación, compró P después de que llegó la recomendación R. Para el experimento, consideramos solo pares de nodos (U, V), donde se enviaron al menos un total de 10 recomendaciones de U a V. Realizamos el experimento utilizando solo recomendaciones del mismo grupo de productos. La Figura 6 muestra la probabilidad de comprar en función del número total de recomendaciones intercambiadas entre dos personas hasta ese momento. Para los libros observamos que la efectividad de la recomendación permanece sobre constante hasta 3 recomendaciones intercambiadas. A medida que aumenta el número de recomendaciones intercambiadas, la probabilidad de compra comienza a disminuir a aproximadamente la mitad del valor original y luego se nivela. Para DVD observamos una caída inmediata y consistente. Este experimento muestra que las recomendaciones comienzan a perder efecto después de que se pasan más de dos o tres entre dos personas. Realizamos el experimento también para video y música, pero el número de observaciones fue demasiado bajo y las mediciones fueron ruidosas.3.3 éxito de las recomendaciones salientes en secciones anteriores Examinamos los datos desde el punto de vista del receptor de la recomendación. Ahora miramos desde el punto de vista del remitente. Las dos preguntas interesantes son: ¿cómo la probabilidad de obtener un cambio crediticio del 10% con el número de recomendaciones salientes;Y dadas una serie de recomendaciones salientes, ¿cuántas compras influirán? Uno esperaría que las recomendaciones sean las más efectivas cuando se recomiendan al subconjunto correcto de amigos. Si uno es muy selectivo y recomienda muy pocos amigos, entonces las posibilidades de éxito son escasas. Una otra mano, recomendarlos a todos y enviarlos spam con recomendaciones también puede tener rendimientos limitados. La fila superior de la Figura 7 muestra cómo cambia el número promedio de compras con el número de recomendaciones salientes. Para libros, música y videos, el número de compras pronto se satura: crece rápidamente hasta alrededor de 10 recomendaciones salientes y luego la tendencia se ralentiza o comienza a caer. Los DVD exhiben un comportamiento diferente, con el número esperado de compras en todo momento. Pero si trazamos la probabilidad de obtener un crédito del 10% en función del número de recomendaciones salientes, como en la fila inferior de la Figura 7, vemos que el éxito de las recomendaciones de DVD también se satura, mientras que los libros, los videos y la música tienentendencias cualitativamente similares. La diferencia en las curvas para las recomendaciones de DVD apunta a la presencia de colisiones en la densa red de DVD, que tiene 10 recomendaciones por nodo y alrededor de 400 por producto, un orden de magnitud más que otros grupos de productos. Esto significa que muchas personas diferentes recomiendan a la misma persona, y después de esa persona realiza una compra, a pesar de que todas hicieron una recomendación exitosa 233 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Recomendaciones salientes Número de compras 20 40 60 60 60 60100 120 140 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Recomendaciones salientes Número de compras 5 10 15 20 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 Recomendaciones salientes Número de compras 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 Número de recomendaciones salientes de las compras 10 20 30 50 60 70 80 80 80 80 00 00 00 0 800.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 Recomendaciones salientes Probabilidad de Crecio 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 0.02 0.04 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 Recomendaciones salientes Probabilidad Probabilidad de 5 10 15 20 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 Recomendaciones salientes Probabilidad de la probabilidad 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 0.02 0.040.08 Recomendaciones salientes Probabilidad ProbabilidadfRedit (A) Libros (B) DVD (C) Música (D) Video Figura 7: Fila superior: Número de compras resultantes dadas una serie de recomendaciones salientes.

Tiempo de recomendaciones y compras El programa de referencia de recomendación alienta a las personas a comprar lo antes posible después de obtener una recomendación, ya que esto maximiza la probabilidad de obtener un descuento. Estudiamos el retraso de tiempo entre la recomendación y la compra de diferentes grupos de productos, efectivamente cuánto tiempo lleva a una persona recibir una recomendación, considerarla y actuar en consecuencia. Presentamos los histogramas del tiempo de pensamiento, es decir, la diferencia entre el momento de la compra y la hora en que se recibió la última recomendación para el producto antes de la compra (Figura 8). Alrededor del 35% del 40% de las compras de libros y DVD ocurrieron dentro de un día después de que se recibió la última recomendación. Para DVD, el 16% de las compras ocurren más de una semana después de la última recomendación, mientras que esto cae al 10% para los libros. En contraste, si consideramos el retraso entre la compra y la primera recomendación, solo el 23% de las compras de DVD se realizan dentro de un día, mientras que la proporción permanece igual para los libros. Esto refleja una mayor probabilidad de que una persona reciba múltiples recomendaciones para un DVD que para un libro. Al mismo tiempo, los recomendadores de DVD tienden a enviar muchas más recomendaciones, solo una de las cuales puede resultar en un descuento. Las personas a menudo pierden su posibilidad de un descuento, que se refleja en la alta relación (78%) de las compras de DVD recomendadas que no obtuvieron descuento (ver Tabla 1, columnas BB y BE). En contraste, para los libros, solo el 21% de las compras a través de recomendaciones no recibieron un descuento. También medimos la variación en la intensidad por hora del día para tres actividades diferentes en el sistema de recomendación: recomendaciones (Figura 9 (a)), todas las compras (Figura 9 (b)) y finalmente las compras que resultan en un descuento (Figura 9 (c)). Cada uno se da como un recuento total por hora del día. Las recomendaciones y compras siguen el mismo patrón. La única pequeña diferencia es que las compras alcanzan un pico más agudo en la tarde (después de las 3 p.m., hora del Pacífico, a las 6 p.m., hora del este). Las compras que resultaron en un descuento parecen una imagen negativa de las dos primeras cifras. Esto significa que la mayoría de las compras con descuento ocurrieron en la mañana cuando el tráfico (número de compras/recomendaciones) en el sitio web de los minoristas fue bajo. Esto tiene mucho sentido ya que la mayoría de las recomendaciones ocurrieron durante el día, y si la persona quería obtener el descuento al ser la primera en comprar, tuvo las más altas posibilidades cuando el tráfico en el sitio web era el más bajo.5. La efectividad de la recomendación por categoría de libros, las redes sociales son un producto de los contextos que unen a las personas. Algunos contextos dan como resultado lazos sociales que son más efectivos para realizar una acción. Por ejemplo, en los experimentos de pequeños mundos, donde los participantes intentan llegar a un individuo objetivo a través de su cadena de conocidos, la profesión superó la geografía, que a su vez fue más útil para localizar un objetivo que atributos como la religión o los pasatiempos [9, 17]. En el contexto de las recomendaciones de productos, podemos preguntarnos si una recomendación para un trabajo de ficción, que puede hacer cualquier amigo o vecino, es 234 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 4 6 8 10 x 10 5 horas del díaRecomendaciones 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 x 10 4 horas de día Allpurchases 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 Hora del día Contradas con descuento (a) Recomendaciones (B) Compras (C)Compras con descuento Figura 9: hora del día para compras y recomendaciones.(A) muestra la distribución de recomendaciones durante el día, (b) muestra todas las compras y (c) muestra solo compras que resultaron en obtener descuento.Más o menos influyente que una recomendación para un libro técnico, que puede ser realizado por un colega en el trabajo o la escuela. La Tabla 2 muestra tendencias de recomendación para todas las categorías de libros de nivel superior por tema. Se puede encontrar un análisis de otros tipos de productos en la versión extendida del documento. Para mayor claridad, agrupamos los resultados en 4 tipos de categorías diferentes: ficción, personal/ocio, profesional/técnico y no ficción/otro. La ficción abarca categorías como ciencia ficción y romance, así como niños y libros para adultos jóvenes. Personal/ocio abarca todo, desde jardinería, fotografía y cocina hasta salud y religión. Primero, comparamos el número relativo de recomendaciones con las revisiones publicadas en el sitio (columna Cav/RP1 de la Tabla 2). Sorprendentemente, encontramos que el número de personas que hacen recomendaciones personales fue solo unas pocas veces mayor que el número de personas que publican una revisión pública en el sitio web. Observamos que los libros de ficción tienen relativamente pocas recomendaciones en comparación con la cantidad de revisiones, mientras que los libros profesionales y técnicos tienen más recomendaciones que revisiones. Esto podría reflejar varios factores. Una es que las personas se sienten más seguras revisando la ficción que los libros técnicos. Otra es que dudan en recomendar un trabajo de ficción antes de leerla ellos mismos, ya que la recomendación debe hacerse en el punto de compra. Otra explicación más es que el precio medio de una obra de ficción es más bajo que el de un libro técnico. Esto significa que el descuento recibido para recomendar con éxito una novela o thriller misterioso es más bajo y, por lo tanto, las personas tienen menos incentivos para enviar recomendaciones. A continuación, medimos la eficacia por categoría de recomendaciones observando la relación del número de compras que ocurren dentro de una semana después de una recomendación al número de recomendadores para cada categoría de sujeto de libro (columna B de la Tabla 2). En promedio, solo el 2% de los recomendadores de un libro recibieron un descuento porque su recomendación fue aceptada, y otro 1% hizo una recomendación que resultó en una compra, pero no un descuento. Observamos marcadas diferencias en la respuesta a la recomendación para diferentes categorías de libros. La ficción en general no se recomienda de manera muy efectiva, con solo alrededor del 2% de los recomendadores que tienen éxito. La eficacia fue un poco más alta (alrededor del 3%) para los libros de no ficción que se ocupan de actividades personales y de ocio, pero es significativamente mayor en la categoría profesional y técnica. Los libros de medicina tienen casi el doble de la tasa promedio de aceptación de recomendación. Esto podría atribuirse en parte al mayor precio medio de los libros de medicina y los libros técnicos en general. Como veremos en la Sección 6, un mayor precio del producto aumenta la posibilidad de que se acepte una recomendación. También es más probable que se acepten recomendaciones para ciertas categorías religiosas: 4.3% para la vida cristiana y la teología y 4.8% para las Biblias. En contraste, los libros no vinculados a las religiones organizadas, como las que están en el tema de la nueva era (2.5%) y la espiritualidad oculta (2.2%), tienen una menor efectividad de recomendación. Estos resultados plantean la posibilidad interesante de que los individuos tengan una mayor influencia entre sí en un contexto organizado, por ejemplo, a través de un contacto profesional o uno religioso. Hay excepciones, por supuesto. Por ejemplo, los DVD de anime japoneses tienen seguidores fuertes en los EE. UU., Y esto se refleja en su frecuencia y éxito en las recomendaciones. Otro ejemplo es el de la jardinería. En general, las recomendaciones para los libros relacionados con la jardinería tienen solo una modesta posibilidad de ser aceptado, lo que está de acuerdo con la prerrogativa individual que acompaña a este pasatiempo. Al mismo tiempo, el cultivo de orquídeas puede ser una actividad altamente organizada y social, con espectáculos frecuentes y comunidades en línea dedicadas por completo a las orquídeas. Quizás debido a esto, la tasa de aceptación de las recomendaciones de los libros de orquídeas es el doble que los de los libros sobre el crecimiento de vegetales o tomate.6. Modelando el éxito de recomendación Hemos examinado las propiedades de la red de recomendaciones en relación con el marketing viral, pero aún queda una pregunta: ¿qué determina los productos el éxito del marketing viral? Presentamos un modelo que caracteriza las categorías de productos para las cuales es más probable que sean aceptadas. Utilizamos una regresión de los siguientes atributos del producto para correlacionarlos con el éxito de la recomendación: • R: Número de recomendaciones • NS: Número de remitentes de recomendaciones • NR: Número de destinatarios de recomendaciones • P: Precio del producto • V: Número dereviews of the product • t: average product rating 235 category np n cc rp1 vav cav/ pm b ∗ 100 rp1 Books general 370230 2,860,714 1.87 5.28 4.32 1.41 14.95 3.12 Fiction Childrens Books 46,451 390,283 2.82 6.44 4.52 1.12 8.76 2.06** Literature & Fiction41,682 502,179 3.06 13.09 4.30 0.57 11.87 2.82* Misterio y thrillers 10,734 123,392 6.03 20.14 4.08 0.36 9.60 2.40 ** Ciencia ficción y fantasía 10,008 175,168 6.17 19.90 4.15 0.64 10.39 2.34 Romance 6.317 60 81 4.17 0.52 6.99 1.78 ** Adolescentes 5,857 81,2605.72 20.52 4.36 0.41 9.56 1.94 ** Cómics y novelas gráficas 3,565 46,564 11.70 4.76 4.36 2.03 10.47 2.30* Horror 2,773 48,321 9.35 21.26 4.16 0.44 9.60 1.81 ** Personal/Leisure Religion and Specortity 43, 44. 45 1.73 9.99 3.13 Mente y cuerpo de salud33,751 572,704 1.54 4.34 4.41 2.39 13.96 3.04 Historia 28,458 28,3406 2.74 4.34 4.30 1.27 18.00 2.84 Hogar y jardín 19,024 180,009 2.91 1.78 4.31 3.48 15.37 2.26 ** Entretenimiento 18,724 258,142 3.97. 66* Artes y fotografía 17,153 179,074 3.49 1.56 4.423.85 20.95 2.87 Viajes 12,670 113,939 3.91 2.74 4.26 1.87 13.27 2.39 ** Deportes 10,183 120,103 1.74 3.36 4.34 1.99 13.97 2.26 ** Parenting y familias 8,324 182,792 0,71 4.42 2.57 11.87 2.81 alimentos y vino 8,324 182,792. 3.02 3.14 4.45 3.49 13.97 2.38* Al aire libre& Nature 6,413 59,764 2.23 1.93 4.42 2.50 15.00 3.05 Profesional/técnico Profesional y Técnico 41,794 459,889 1.72 1.91 4.30 3.22 32.50 4.54 ** Negocios e invertir 29,002 476,542 1.55 3.61 4.22 2.94 20.99 3.62 Ciencia e invertir 29,002 476,542 1.55 3.61 4.22 2.94 20.99 3.62 Ciencia e invertir 29,002 476,542 1.55 3.61 4.22 2.94 20.99 3.62 Ciencia e invertir 29,002 476,542 1.55 3.61 4.22 2.94 20.99 3.62 Ciencia e invertir 29,002 476,542 1.55 3.61 4.22 2.94 20.99 3.62 2.42 28.00 3.90 **Computadoras e Internet 18,941 375,712 2.22 4.51 3.98 3.10 34.95 3.61 ** Medicina 16,047 175,520 1.08 1.41 4.40 4.19 39.95 5.68 ** Ingeniería 10,312 107,255 1.30 1.43 4.14 3.85 59.95 4.10 ** Law 5,176 53,182. 95 3.66* no ficción-otra no ficción 55,868560,552 2.03 3.13 4.29 1.89 18.95 3.28 ** Referencia 26,834 371,959 1.94 2.49 4.19 3.04 17.47 3.21 Biografías y memorias 18,233 277,356 2.80 7.65 4.34 0.90 14.00 2.96 Tabla 2: Estadísticas por libros Categiales 277,356 2.80 7.65 4.34 0.90 14.00 2.96 Tabla 2: Estadísticas por libros Categantes de 277,356 2.80 7.65 4.34 0.90 14.00 2.96 Tabla 2: Estadísticas por libros CategantesCC porcentaje de clientes en el componente conectado más grande, RP1 av.# Reseñas en 2001 - 2003, RP2 AV.# Revisiones 1 ° 6 meses 2005, calificación de estrella promedio de VAV, Número promedio de personas que recomiendan productos, relación Cav/RP1 de recomendadores a revisores, precio mediano de PM, relación B del número de compras resultantes de una recomendación al número de recomendadores. El símbolo ** denota significación estadística en el nivel 0.01, * en el nivel 0.05. Desde el conjunto original de medio millón de productos, calculamos una tasa de éxito para los 48,218 productos que tenían al menos una compra realizada a través de una recomendación y por la cual se dio un precio. En la Sección 5 definimos la tasa de éxito de recomendaciones como la relación de las compras de números totales realizados a través de recomendaciones y el número de remitentes de las recomendaciones. Decidimos utilizar este tipo de normalización, en lugar de normalizar el número total de recomendaciones enviadas, para no penalizar a las comunidades donde algunas personas envían muchas recomendaciones (Figura 2 (b)). Dado que las variables siguen una distribución de cola pesada, utilizamos el siguiente modelo: S = Exp (I βi log (xi) + i) donde Xi son los atributos del producto (como se describe en la página anterior), y I es un error aleatorio. Se ajustamos al modelo usando mínimos cuadrados y obtenemos los coeficientes βi que se muestran en la Tabla 3. Con la excepción de la calificación promedio, todos son significativos. Los únicos dos atributos con un coeficiente positivo son el número de recomendaciones y precio. Esto muestra que los productos más caros y más recomendados tienen una tasa de éxito más alta. El número de remitentes y receptores tiene grandes coeficientes negativos, lo que demuestra que los productos recomendados con éxito tienen más probabilidades de no ser tan populares. Tienen relativamente muchas recomendaciones con un pequeño número de remitentes y receptores, lo que sugiere una red de recomendaciones muy densa donde se intercambiaron muchas recomendaciones entre una pequeña comunidad de personas. Estas ideas podrían ser para los especialistas en marketing: las recomendaciones personales son más efectivas en pequeñas comunidades densamente conectadas que disfrutan de productos caros.236 coeficiente variable βi const -0.940 (0.025) ** r 0.426 (0.013) ** ns -0.782 (0.004) ** nr -1.307 (0.015) ** P 0.128 (0.004) ** V -0.011 (0.002) **t -0.027 (0.014)* R2 0.74 Tabla 3: Regresión utilizando el registro de la tasa de éxito de recomendación, LN (s), como la variable dependiente.

Discusión y conclusión Aunque el minorista puede haber esperado aumentar sus ingresos a través del marketing viral, las compras adicionales que resultaron de las recomendaciones son solo una caída en el cubo de ventas que ocurren a través del sitio web. Sin embargo, pudimos obtener una serie de ideas interesantes sobre cómo funciona el marketing viral que desafían los supuestos comunes hechos en la epidemia y el modelado de propagación de rumores. En primer lugar, se supone con frecuencia en los modelos epidémicos que los individuos tienen la misma probabilidad de estar infectados cada vez que interactúan. Contrariamente a esto, observamos que la probabilidad de infección disminuye con la interacción repetida. Los especialistas en marketing deben prestar atención a que proporcionar incentivos excesivos para que los clientes recomienden productos podrían debilitar la credibilidad de los mismos enlaces que están tratando de aprovechar. Los modelos tradicionales de difusión de epidemia e innovación también a menudo suponen que las personas tienen una probabilidad constante de convertir cada vez que interactúan con un individuo infectado o que se convierten una vez que la fracción de sus contactos que están infectados excede un umbral. En ambos casos, un número creciente de contactos infectados da como resultado una mayor probabilidad de infección. En cambio, encontramos que la probabilidad de comprar un producto aumenta con el número de recomendaciones recibidas, pero se satura rápidamente a una probabilidad constante y relativamente baja. Esto significa que las personas a menudo son impermeables a las recomendaciones de sus amigos y se resisten a comprar artículos que no desean. En los modelos de epidemia basados en la red, las personas extremadamente altamente conectadas juegan un papel muy importante. Por ejemplo, en las redes de intercambio de agujas y contacto sexual, estos nodos se convierten en los súper propagadores al infectar a una gran cantidad de personas. Pero estos modelos suponen que un nodo de alto grado tiene una gran probabilidad de infectar a cada uno de sus vecinos como lo hace un nodo de bajo grado. Por el contrario, encontramos que hay límites para cuán influyentes son los nodos de alto grado en la red de recomendaciones. Como una persona envía más y más recomendaciones más allá de cierto número para un producto, el éxito por recomendación disminuye. Esto parece indicar que las personas tienen influencia sobre algunos de sus amigos, pero no todos los que conocen. También presentamos un modelo estocástico simple que permite la presencia de cascadas relativamente grandes para algunos productos, pero refleja bien la tendencia general de las cadenas de recomendación a terminar después de un breve número de pasos. Vimos que las características de las revisiones de productos y la efectividad de las recomendaciones varían según la categoría y el precio, con recomendaciones más exitosas que se hacen en libros técnicos o religiosos, que presumiblemente se colocan en el contexto social de una escuela, trabajo o lugar de culto. Finalmente, presentamos un modelo que muestra que los grupos más pequeños y más bien tejidos tienden a ser más propicios para el marketing viral. Entonces, a pesar de la relativa ineficacia del programa de marketing viral en general, encontramos una serie de nuevas ideas que esperamos tener aplicabilidad general a las estrategias de marketing y a los modelos futuros de información de información viral.8.

        "We observe the propagation of recommendations and the cascade sizes, which we explain by a simple stochastic model.",
        "We then establish how the recommendation network grows over time and how effective it is from the viewpoint of the sender and receiver of the recommendations.",
        "While on average recommendations are not very effective at inducing purchases and do not spread very far, we present a model that successfully identifies product and pricing categories for which viral marketing seems to be very effective.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors J.4 [Social and Behavioral Sciences]: Economics General Terms Economics 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION With consumers showing increasing resistance to traditional forms of advertising such as TV or newspaper ads, marketers have turned to alternate strategies, including viral marketing.",
        "Viral marketing exploits existing social networks by encouraging customers to share product information with their friends.",
        "Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]).",
        "But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.",
        "We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised viral marketing program.",
        "The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.",
        "Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor influencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for advertisers to tap into.",
        "Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication.",
        "Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.",
        "Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7].",
        "Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.",
        "Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.",
        "At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.",
        "Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a fat tail phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items.",
        "On Amazon.com, somewhere between 20 to 40 percent of unit sales fall outside of its top 100,000 ranked products [2].",
        "Rhapsody, a streaming-music service, streams more tracks outside than inside its top 10,000 tunes [1].",
        "Effectively advertising these niche products using traditional advertising approaches is impractical.",
        "Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the consumer, who would benefit from learning about new products.",
        "The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.",
        "Quantitative marketing techniques have been proposed [12], and the rating of products and merchants has been shown to effect the likelihood of an item being bought [13, 4].",
        "Of further help to the consumer are collaborative filtering recommendations of the form people who bought x also bought y feature [11].",
        "These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.",
        "It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.",
        "Our friends are also acquainted with our needs and tastes, and can make appropriate recommendations.",
        "A Lucid Marketing survey found that 68% of individuals consulted friends and relatives before purchasing home electronics - more than the half who used search engines to find product information [3].",
        "Several studies have attempted to model just this kind of network influence.",
        "Richardson and Domingos [14] used Epinions trusted reviewer network to construct an algorithm to maximize viral marketing efficiency assuming that individuals probability of purchasing a product depends on the opinions on the trusted peers in their network.",
        "Kempe, Kleinberg and Tardos [8] evaluate the efficiency of several algorithms for maximizing the size of influence set given various models of adoption.",
        "While these models address the question of maximizing the spread of influence in a network, they are based on assumed rather than measured influence effects.",
        "In contrast, in our study we are able to directly observe the effectiveness of person to person word of mouth advertising for hundreds of thousands of products for the first time.",
        "We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial purchase of a product.",
        "However, occasionally a product will propagate through a very active recommendation network.",
        "We propose a simple stochastic model that seems to explain the propagation of recommendations.",
        "Moreover, the characteristics of recommendation networks influence the purchase patterns of their members.",
        "For example, individuals likelihood of purchasing a product initially increases as they receive additional recommendations for it, but a saturation point is quickly reached.",
        "Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.",
        "We also propose models to identify products for which viral marketing is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often.",
        "We also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are likely to be shopping online or reading email.",
        "We report on these and other findings in the following sections. 2.",
        "THE RECOMMENDATION NETWORK 2.1 Dataset description Our analysis focuses on the recommendation referral program run by a large retailer.",
        "The program rules were as follows.",
        "Each time a person purchases a book, music, or a movie he or she is given the option of sending emails recommending the item to friends.",
        "The first person to purchase the same item through a referral link in the email gets a 10% discount.",
        "When this happens the sender of the recommendation receives a 10% credit on their purchase.",
        "The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users.",
        "The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003.",
        "In total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos.",
        "In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailers website to obtain product categories, reviews and ratings for all products.",
        "Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).",
        "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
        "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor.",
        "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product.",
        "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
        "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
        "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
        "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
        "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product.",
        "Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 Recommendation network statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the product and product price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount.",
        "The sender and receiver IDs were shadowed.",
        "We represent this data set as a directed multi graph.",
        "The nodes represent customers, and a directed edge contains all the information about the recommendation.",
        "The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended product p to customer j at time t. The typical process generating edges in the recommendation network is as follows: a node i first buys a product p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn.",
        "The j nodes can they buy the product and further recommend it.",
        "The only way for a node to recommend a product is to first buy it.",
        "Note that even if all nodes j buy a product, only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase (within a week after the recommendation) will be marked by a buy-bit.",
        "Because the buy-bit is set only for the first person who acts on a recommendation, we identify additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations must be preceded by a purchase.",
        "We call this type of evidence of purchase a buyedge.",
        "Note that buy-edges provide only a lower bound on the total number of purchases without discounts.",
        "It is possible for a customer to not be the first to act on a recommendation and also to not recommend the product to others.",
        "Unfortunately, this was not recorded in the data set.",
        "We consider, however, the buy-bits and buy-edges as proxies for the total number of purchases through recommendations.",
        "For each product group we took recommendations on all products from the group and created a network.",
        "Table 1 229 0 1 2 3 4 x 10 6 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 x 10 4 number of nodes sizeofgiantcomponent by month quadratic fit 0 10 20 0 2 4 x 10 6 m (month) n # nodes 1.7*10 6 m 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 kp (recommendations by a person for a product) N(x>=k p ) level 0 γ = 2.6 level 1 γ = 2.0 level 2 γ = 1.5 level 3 γ = 1.2 level 4 γ = 1.2 (a) Network growth (b) Recommending by level Figure 1: (a) The size of the largest connected component of customers over time.",

        "The column eu shows the number of unique edges - disregarding multiple recommendations between the same source and recipient.",
        "In terms of the number of different items, there are by far the most music CDs, followed by books and videos.",
        "There is a surprisingly small number of DVD titles.",
        "On the other hand, DVDs account for more half of all recommendations in the dataset.",
        "The DVD network is also the most dense, having about 10 recommendations per node, while books and music have about 2 recommendations per node and videos have only a bit more than 1 recommendation per node.",
        "Music recommendations reached about the same number of people as DVDs but used more than 5 times fewer recommendations to achieve the same coverage of the nodes.",
        "Book recommendations reached by far the most people - 2.8 million.",
        "Notice that all networks have a very small number of unique edges.",
        "For books, videos and music the number of unique edges is smaller than the number of nodes - this suggests that the networks are highly disconnected [5].",
        "Figure 1(a) shows the fraction of nodes in largest weakly connected component over time.",
        "Notice the component is very small.",
        "Even if we compose a network using all the recommendations in the dataset, the largest connected component contains less than 2.5% (100,420) of the nodes, and the second largest component has only 600 nodes.",
        "Still, some smaller communities, numbering in the tens of thousands of purchasers of DVDs in categories such as westerns, classics and Japanese animated films (anime), had connected components spanning about 20% of their members.",
        "The insert in figure 1(a) shows the growth of the customer base over time.",
        "Surprisingly it was linear, adding on average 165,000 new users each month, which is an indication that the service itself was not spreading epidemically.",
        "Further evidence of non-viral spread is provided by the relatively high percentage (94%) of users who made their first recommendation without having previously received one.",
        "Back to table 1: given the total number of recommendations e and purchases (bb + be) influenced by recommendations we can estimate how many recommendations need to be independently sent over the network to induce a new purchase.",
        "Using this metric books have the most influential recommendations followed by DVDs and music.",
        "For books one out of 69 recommendations resulted in a purchase.",
        "For DVDs it increases to 108 recommendations per purchase and further increases to 136 for music and 203 for video.",
        "Even with these simple counts we can make the first few observations.",
        "It seems that some people got quite heavily involved in the recommendation program, and that they tended to recommend a large number of products to the same set of friends (since the number of unique edges is so small).",
        "This shows that people tend to buy more DVDs and also like to recommend them to their friends, while they seem to be more conservative with books.",
        "One possible reason is that a book is bigger time investment than a DVD: one usually needs several days to read a book, while a DVD can be viewed in a single evening.",
        "One external factor which may be affecting the recommendation patterns for DVDs is the existence of referral websites (www.dvdtalk.com).",
        "On these websites people, who want to buy a DVD and get a discount, would ask for recommendations.",
        "This way there would be recommendations made between people who dont really know each other but rather have an economic incentive to cooperate.",
        "We were not able to find similar referral sharing sites for books or CDs. 2.3 Forward recommendations Not all people who make a purchase also decide to give recommendations.",
        "So we estimate what fraction of people that purchase also decide to recommend forward.",
        "To obtain this information we can only use the nodes with purchases that resulted in a discount.",
        "The last 3 columns of table 1 show that only about a third of the people that purchase also recommend the product forward.",
        "The ratio of forward recommendations is much higher for DVDs than for other kinds of products.",
        "Videos also have a higher ratio of forward recommendations, while books have the lowest.",
        "This shows that people are most keen on recommending movies, while more conservative when recommending books and music.",

        "It shows that the deeper an individual is in the cascade, if they choose to make recommendations, they tend to recommend to a greater number of people on average (the distribution has a higher variance).",
        "This effect is probably due to only very heavily recommended products producing large enough cascades to reach a certain depth.",
        "We also observe that the probability of an individual making a recommendation at all (which can only occur if they make a purchase), declines after an initial increase as one gets deeper into the cascade. 2.4 Identifying cascades As customers continue forwarding recommendations, they contribute to the formation of cascades.",
        "In order to identify cascades, i.e. the causal propagation of recommendations, we track successful recommendations as they influence purchases and further recommendations.",

        "Notice that, because of the probabilistic nature of the threshold being exceeded, one can only compute the final distribution of recommendation chain lengths, which we now proceed to do.",
        "Subtracting from both sides of this equation the term Nt and diving by it we obtain N(t+1) − Nt Nt = pt − 1 (2) Summing both sides from the initial time to some very large time T and assuming that for long times the numerator is smaller than the denominator (a reasonable assumption) we get dN N = pt (3) The left hand integral is just ln(N), and the right hand side is a sum of random variables, which in the limit of a very large uncorrelated number of recommendations is normally distributed (central limit theorem).",
        "This means that the logarithm of the number of messages is normally distributed, or equivalently, that the number of messages passed is log-normally distributed.",
        "In other words the probability density for N is given by P(N) = 1 N √ 2πσ2 exp −(ln(N) − μ)2 2σ2 (4) which, for large variances describes a behavior whereby the typical number of recommendations is small (the mode of the distribution) but there are unlikely events of large chains of recommendations which are also observable.",
        "Furthermore, for large variances, the lognormal distribution can behave like a power law for a range of values.",
        "In order to see this, take the logarithms on both sides of the equation (equivalent to a log-log plot) and one obtains ln(P(N)) = − ln(N) − ln( √ 2πσ2) − (ln (N) − μ)2 2σ2 (5) So, for large σ, the last term of the right hand side goes to zero, and since the the second term is a constant one obtains a power law behavior with exponent value of minus one.",
        "There are other models which produce power-law distributions of cascade sizes, but we present ours for its simplicity, since it does not depend on network topology [6] or critical thresholds in the probability of a recommendation being accepted [18]. 3.",
        "SUCCESS OF RECOMMENDATIONS So far we only looked into the aggregate statistics of the recommendation network.",
        "Next, we ask questions about the effectiveness of recommendations in the recommendation network itself.",

        "Next, we measure recommendation effectiveness as two people exchange more and more recommendations.",
        "Lastly, we observe the recommendation network from the perspective of the sender of the recommendation.",
        "Does a node that makes more recommendations also influence more purchases? 3.1 Probability of buying versus number of incoming recommendations First, we examine how the probability of purchasing changes as one gets more and more recommendations.",
        "One would expect that a person is more likely to buy a product if she gets more recommendations.",
        "On the other had one would also think that there is a saturation point - if a person hasnt bought a product after a number of recommendations, they are not likely to change their minds after receiving even more of them.",
        "So, how many recommendations are too many?",
        "Figure 5 shows the probability of purchasing a product as a function of the number of incoming recommendations on the product.",
        "As we move to higher numbers of incoming recommendations, the number of observations drops rapidly.",
        "For example, there were 5 million cases with 1 incoming recommendation on a book, and only 58 cases where a person got 20 incoming recommendations on a particular book.",
        "The maximum was 30 incoming recommendations.",
        "For these reasons we cut-off the plot when the number of observations becomes too small and the error bars too large.",
        "Figure 5(a) shows that, overall, book recommendations are rarely followed.",
        "Even more surprisingly, as more and more recommendations are received, their success decreases.",
        "We observe a peak in probability of buying at 2 incoming recommendations and then a slow drop.",
        "For DVDs (figure 5(b)) we observe a saturation around 10 incoming recommendations.",
        "This means that after a person gets 10 recommendations on a particular DVD, they become immune to them - their probability of buying does not increase anymore.",
        "The number of observations is 2.5 million at 1 incoming recommendation and 100 at 60 incoming recommendations.",

        "A large number of exchanged recommendations can be a sign of trust and influence, but a sender of too many recommendations can be perceived as a spammer.",
        "A person who recommends only a few products will have her friends attention, but one who floods her friends with all sorts of recommendations will start to loose her influence.",
        "We measure the effectiveness of recommendations as a function of the total number of previously exchanged recommendations between the two nodes.",
        "We construct the experiment in the following way.",
        "For every recommendation r on some product p between nodes u and v, we first determine how many recommendations were exchanged between u and v before recommendation r. Then we check whether v, the recipient of recommendation, purchased p after recommendation r arrived.",
        "For the experiment we consider only node pairs (u, v), where there were at least a total of 10 recommendations sent from u to v. We perform the experiment using only recommendations from the same product group.",
        "Figure 6 shows the probability of buying as a function of the total number of exchanged recommendations between two persons up to that point.",
        "For books we observe that the effectiveness of recommendation remains about constant up to 3 exchanged recommendations.",
        "As the number of exchanged recommendations increases, the probability of buying starts to decrease to about half of the original value and then levels off.",
        "For DVDs we observe an immediate and consistent drop.",
        "This experiment shows that recommendations start to lose effect after more than two or three are passed between two people.",
        "We performed the experiment also for video and music, but the number of observations was too low and the measurements were noisy. 3.3 Success of outgoing recommendations In previous sections we examined the data from the viewpoint of the receiver of the recommendation.",
        "Now we look from the viewpoint of the sender.",
        "The two interesting questions are: how does the probability of getting a 10% credit change with the number of outgoing recommendations; and given a number of outgoing recommendations, how many purchases will they influence?",
        "One would expect that recommendations would be the most effective when recommended to the right subset of friends.",
        "If one is very selective and recommends to too few friends, then the chances of success are slim.",
        "One the other hand, recommending to everyone and spamming them with recommendations may have limited returns as well.",
        "The top row of figure 7 shows how the average number of purchases changes with the number of outgoing recommendations.",
        "For books, music, and videos the number of purchases soon saturates: it grows fast up to around 10 outgoing recommendations and then the trend either slows or starts to drop.",
        "DVDs exhibit different behavior, with the expected number of purchases increasing throughout.",
        "But if we plot the probability of getting a 10% credit as a function of the number of outgoing recommendations, as in the bottom row of figure 7, we see that the success of DVD recommendations saturates as well, while books, videos and music have qualitatively similar trends.",
        "The difference in the curves for DVD recommendations points to the presence of collisions in the dense DVD network, which has 10 recommendations per node and around 400 per product - an order of magnitude more than other product groups.",

        "This reflects a greater likelihood for a person to receive multiple recommendations for a DVD than for a book.",
        "At the same time, DVD recommenders tend to send out many more recommendations, only one of which can result in a discount.",
        "Individuals then often miss their chance of a discount, which is reflected in the high ratio (78%) of recommended DVD purchases that did not a get discount (see table 1, columns bb and be).",
        "In contrast, for books, only 21% of purchases through recommendations did not receive a discount.",
        "We also measure the variation in intensity by time of day for three different activities in the recommendation system: recommendations (figure 9(a)), all purchases (figure 9(b)), and finally just the purchases which resulted in a discount (figure 9(c)).",
        "Each is given as a total count by hour of day.",
        "The recommendations and purchases follow the same pattern.",
        "The only small difference is that purchases reach a sharper peak in the afternoon (after 3pm Pacific Time, 6pm Eastern time).",
        "The purchases that resulted in a discount look like a negative image of the first two figures.",
        "This means that most of discounted purchases happened in the morning when the traffic (number of purchases/recommendations) on the retailers website was low.",
        "This makes a lot of sense since most of the recommendations happened during the day, and if the person wanted to get the discount by being the first one to purchase, she had the highest chances when the traffic on the website was the lowest. 5.",

        "For clarity, we group the results by 4 different category types: fiction, personal/leisure, professional/technical, and nonfiction/other.",
        "Fiction encompasses categories such as Sci-Fi and Romance, as well as childrens and young adult books.",
        "Personal/Leisure encompasses everything from gardening, photography and cooking to health and religion.",
        "First, we compare the relative number of recommendations to reviews posted on the site (column cav/rp1 of table 2).",
        "Surprisingly, we find that the number of people making personal recommendations was only a few times greater than the number of people posting a public review on the website.",
        "We observe that fiction books have relatively few recommendations compared to the number of reviews, while professional and technical books have more recommendations than reviews.",
        "This could reflect several factors.",
        "One is that people feel more confident reviewing fiction than technical books.",
        "Another is that they hesitate to recommend a work of fiction before reading it themselves, since the recommendation must be made at the point of purchase.",
        "Yet another explanation is that the median price of a work of fiction is lower than that of a technical book.",
        "This means that the discount received for successfully recommending a mystery novel or thriller is lower and hence people have less incentive to send recommendations.",
        "Next, we measure the per category efficacy of recommendations by observing the ratio of the number of purchases occurring within a week following a recommendation to the number of recommenders for each book subject category (column b of table 2).",
        "On average, only 2% of the recommenders of a book received a discount because their recommendation was accepted, and another 1% made a recommendation that resulted in a purchase, but not a discount.",
        "We observe marked differences in the response to recommendation for different categories of books.",
        "Fiction in general is not very effectively recommended, with only around 2% of recommenders succeeding.",
        "The efficacy was a bit higher (around 3%) for non-fiction books dealing with personal and leisure pursuits, but is significantly higher in the professional and technical category.",
        "Medical books have nearly double the average rate of recommendation acceptance.",
        "This could be in part attributed to the higher median price of medical books and technical books in general.",
        "As we will see in Section 6, a higher product price increases the chance that a recommendation will be accepted.",
        "Recommendations are also more likely to be accepted for certain religious categories: 4.3% for Christian living and theology and 4.8% for Bibles.",
        "In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower recommendation effectiveness.",
        "These results raise the interesting possibility that individuals have greater influence over one another in an organized context, for example through a professional contact or a religious one.",
        "There are exceptions of course.",
        "For example, Japanese anime DVDs have a strong following in the US, and this is reflected in their frequency and success in recommendations.",
        "Another example is that of gardening.",
        "In general, recommendations for books relating to gardening have only a modest chance of being accepted, which agrees with the individual prerogative that accompanies this hobby.",
        "At the same time, orchid cultivation can be a highly organized and social activity, with frequent shows and online communities devoted entirely to orchids.",
        "Perhaps because of this, the rate of acceptance of orchid book recommendations is twice as high as those for books on vegetable or tomato growing. 6.",

        "We use a regression of the following product attributes to correlate them with recommendation success: • r: number of recommendations • ns: number of senders of recommendations • nr: number of recipients of recommendations • p: price of the product • v: number of reviews of the product • t: average product rating 235 category np n cc rp1 vav cav/ pm b ∗ 100 rp1 Books general 370230 2,860,714 1.87 5.28 4.32 1.41 14.95 3.12 Fiction Childrens Books 46,451 390,283 2.82 6.44 4.52 1.12 8.76 2.06** Literature & Fiction 41,682 502,179 3.06 13.09 4.30 0.57 11.87 2.82* Mystery and Thrillers 10,734 123,392 6.03 20.14 4.08 0.36 9.60 2.40** Science Fiction & Fantasy 10,008 175,168 6.17 19.90 4.15 0.64 10.39 2.34** Romance 6,317 60,902 5.65 12.81 4.17 0.52 6.99 1.78** Teens 5,857 81,260 5.72 20.52 4.36 0.41 9.56 1.94** Comics & Graphic Novels 3,565 46,564 11.70 4.76 4.36 2.03 10.47 2.30* Horror 2,773 48,321 9.35 21.26 4.16 0.44 9.60 1.81** Personal/Leisure Religion and Spirituality 43,423 441,263 1.89 3.87 4.45 1.73 9.99 3.13 Health Mind and Body 33,751 572,704 1.54 4.34 4.41 2.39 13.96 3.04 History 28,458 28,3406 2.74 4.34 4.30 1.27 18.00 2.84 Home and Garden 19,024 180,009 2.91 1.78 4.31 3.48 15.37 2.26** Entertainment 18,724 258,142 3.65 3.48 4.29 2.26 13.97 2.66* Arts and Photography 17,153 179,074 3.49 1.56 4.42 3.85 20.95 2.87 Travel 12,670 113,939 3.91 2.74 4.26 1.87 13.27 2.39** Sports 10,183 120,103 1.74 3.36 4.34 1.99 13.97 2.26** Parenting and Families 8,324 182,792 0.73 4.71 4.42 2.57 11.87 2.81 Cooking Food and Wine 7,655 146,522 3.02 3.14 4.45 3.49 13.97 2.38* Outdoors & Nature 6,413 59,764 2.23 1.93 4.42 2.50 15.00 3.05 Professional/Technical Professional & Technical 41,794 459,889 1.72 1.91 4.30 3.22 32.50 4.54** Business and Investing 29,002 476,542 1.55 3.61 4.22 2.94 20.99 3.62** Science 25,697 271,391 2.64 2.41 4.30 2.42 28.00 3.90** Computers and Internet 18,941 375,712 2.22 4.51 3.98 3.10 34.95 3.61** Medicine 16,047 175,520 1.08 1.41 4.40 4.19 39.95 5.68** Engineering 10,312 107,255 1.30 1.43 4.14 3.85 59.95 4.10** Law 5,176 53,182 2.64 1.89 4.25 2.67 24.95 3.66* Nonfiction-other Nonfiction 55,868 560,552 2.03 3.13 4.29 1.89 18.95 3.28** Reference 26,834 371,959 1.94 2.49 4.19 3.04 17.47 3.21 Biographies and Memoirs 18,233 277,356 2.80 7.65 4.34 0.90 14.00 2.96 Table 2: Statistics by book category: np:number of products in category, n number of customers, cc percentage of customers in the largest connected component, rp1 av. # reviews in 2001 - 2003, rp2 av. # reviews 1st 6 months 2005, vav average star rating, cav average number of people recommending product, cav/rp1 ratio of recommenders to reviewers, pm median price, b ratio of the number of purchases resulting from a recommendation to the number of recommenders.",

        "From the original set of half a million products, we compute a success rate s for the 48,218 products that had at least one purchase made through a recommendation and for which a price was given.",
        "In section 5 we defined recommendation success rate s as the ratio of the total number purchases made through recommendations and the number of senders of the recommendations.",
        "We decided to use this kind of normalization, rather than normalizing by the total number of recommendations sent, in order not to penalize communities where a few individuals send out many recommendations (figure 2(b)).",
        "Since the variables follow a heavy tailed distribution, we use the following model: s = exp( i βi log(xi) + i) where xi are the product attributes (as described on previous page), and i is random error.",
        "We fit the model using least squares and obtain the coefficients βi shown on table 3.",

        "They have relatively many recommendations with a small number of senders and receivers, which suggests a very dense recommendation network where lots of recommendations were exchanged between a small community of people.",

        "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Although the retailer may have hoped to boost its revenues through viral marketing, the additional purchases that resulted from recommendations are just a drop in the bucket of sales that occur through the website.",
        "Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.",
        "Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.",
        "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
        "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
        "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
        "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
        "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
        "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
        "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
        "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
        "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
        "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
        "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
        "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
        "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
        "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
        "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",
        "So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread. 8.",

                "But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.",
                "We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised <br>viral marketing</br> program.",

                "Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for <br>viral marketing</br>, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication.",
                "Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.",
                "Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7].",
                "Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.",
                "Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.",
                "At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.",

                "Effectively advertising these niche products using traditional advertising approaches is impractical.",
                "Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the consumer, who would benefit from learning about new products.",
                "The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.",

                "These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.",
                "It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.",

                "While these models address the question of maximizing the spread of influence in a network, they are based on assumed rather than measured influence effects.",
                "In contrast, in our study we are able to directly observe the effectiveness of person to person word of mouth advertising for hundreds of thousands of products for the first time.",
                "We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial purchase of a product.",
                "However, occasionally a product will propagate through a very active recommendation network.",
                "We propose a simple stochastic model that seems to explain the propagation of recommendations.",
                "Moreover, the characteristics of recommendation networks influence the purchase patterns of their members.",
                "For example, individuals likelihood of purchasing a product initially increases as they receive additional recommendations for it, but a saturation point is quickly reached.",
                "Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.",
                "We also propose models to identify products for which <br>viral marketing</br> is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often.",
                "We also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are likely to be shopping online or reading email.",
                "We report on these and other findings in the following sections. 2.",
                "THE RECOMMENDATION NETWORK 2.1 Dataset description Our analysis focuses on the recommendation referral program run by a large retailer.",
                "The program rules were as follows.",
                "Each time a person purchases a book, music, or a movie he or she is given the option of sending emails recommending the item to friends.",
                "The first person to purchase the same item through a referral link in the email gets a 10% discount.",
                "When this happens the sender of the recommendation receives a 10% credit on their purchase.",
                "The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users.",
                "The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003.",
                "In total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos.",
                "In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailers website to obtain product categories, reviews and ratings for all products.",
                "Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).",
                "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
                "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor.",
                "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product.",
                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
                "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
                "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
                "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
                "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 Recommendation network statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the product and product price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount.",
                "The sender and receiver IDs were shadowed.",
                "We represent this data set as a directed multi graph.",
                "The nodes represent customers, and a directed edge contains all the information about the recommendation.",
                "The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended product p to customer j at time t. The typical process generating edges in the recommendation network is as follows: a node i first buys a product p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn.",
                "The j nodes can they buy the product and further recommend it.",
                "The only way for a node to recommend a product is to first buy it.",
                "Note that even if all nodes j buy a product, only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase (within a week after the recommendation) will be marked by a buy-bit.",
                "Because the buy-bit is set only for the first person who acts on a recommendation, we identify additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations must be preceded by a purchase.",
                "We call this type of evidence of purchase a buyedge.",
                "Note that buy-edges provide only a lower bound on the total number of purchases without discounts.",
                "It is possible for a customer to not be the first to act on a recommendation and also to not recommend the product to others.",
                "Unfortunately, this was not recorded in the data set.",

                "This means that most of discounted purchases happened in the morning when the traffic (number of purchases/recommendations) on the retailers website was low.",
                "This makes a lot of sense since most of the recommendations happened during the day, and if the person wanted to get the discount by being the first one to purchase, she had the highest chances when the traffic on the website was the lowest. 5.",

                "Personal/Leisure encompasses everything from gardening, photography and cooking to health and religion.",
                "First, we compare the relative number of recommendations to reviews posted on the site (column cav/rp1 of table 2).",
                "Surprisingly, we find that the number of people making personal recommendations was only a few times greater than the number of people posting a public review on the website.",
                "We observe that fiction books have relatively few recommendations compared to the number of reviews, while professional and technical books have more recommendations than reviews.",
                "This could reflect several factors.",
                "One is that people feel more confident reviewing fiction than technical books.",
                "Another is that they hesitate to recommend a work of fiction before reading it themselves, since the recommendation must be made at the point of purchase.",
                "Yet another explanation is that the median price of a work of fiction is lower than that of a technical book.",
                "This means that the discount received for successfully recommending a mystery novel or thriller is lower and hence people have less incentive to send recommendations.",
                "Next, we measure the per category efficacy of recommendations by observing the ratio of the number of purchases occurring within a week following a recommendation to the number of recommenders for each book subject category (column b of table 2).",
                "On average, only 2% of the recommenders of a book received a discount because their recommendation was accepted, and another 1% made a recommendation that resulted in a purchase, but not a discount.",
                "We observe marked differences in the response to recommendation for different categories of books.",
                "Fiction in general is not very effectively recommended, with only around 2% of recommenders succeeding.",
                "The efficacy was a bit higher (around 3%) for non-fiction books dealing with personal and leisure pursuits, but is significantly higher in the professional and technical category.",
                "Medical books have nearly double the average rate of recommendation acceptance.",
                "This could be in part attributed to the higher median price of medical books and technical books in general.",
                "As we will see in Section 6, a higher product price increases the chance that a recommendation will be accepted.",
                "Recommendations are also more likely to be accepted for certain religious categories: 4.3% for Christian living and theology and 4.8% for Bibles.",
                "In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower recommendation effectiveness.",
                "These results raise the interesting possibility that individuals have greater influence over one another in an organized context, for example through a professional contact or a religious one.",
                "There are exceptions of course.",
                "For example, Japanese anime DVDs have a strong following in the US, and this is reflected in their frequency and success in recommendations.",
                "Another example is that of gardening.",
                "In general, recommendations for books relating to gardening have only a modest chance of being accepted, which agrees with the individual prerogative that accompanies this hobby.",
                "At the same time, orchid cultivation can be a highly organized and social activity, with frequent shows and online communities devoted entirely to orchids.",
                "Perhaps because of this, the rate of acceptance of orchid book recommendations is twice as high as those for books on vegetable or tomato growing. 6.",

                "Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.",
                "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to <br>viral marketing</br>.",
                "So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the <br>viral marketing</br> program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread. 8.",

                "Viral marketing exploits existing social networks by encouraging customers to share product information with their friends.",
                "Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]).",
                "But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.",
                "We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised viral marketing program.",
                "The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.",
                "Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor influencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for advertisers to tap into.",
                "Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication.",
                "Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.",
                "Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7].",
                "Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.",
                "Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.",
                "At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.",
                "Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a fat tail phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items.",
                "On Amazon.com, somewhere between 20 to 40 percent of unit sales fall outside of its top 100,000 ranked products [2].",
                "Rhapsody, a streaming-music service, streams more tracks outside than inside its top 10,000 tunes [1].",
                "Effectively advertising these niche products using traditional advertising approaches is impractical.",
                "Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the consumer, who would benefit from learning about new products.",
                "The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.",
                "Quantitative marketing techniques have been proposed [12], and the rating of products and merchants has been shown to effect the likelihood of an item being bought [13, 4].",
                "Of further help to the consumer are collaborative filtering recommendations of the form people who bought x also bought y feature [11].",
                "These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.",
                "It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.",
                "Our friends are also acquainted with our needs and tastes, and can make appropriate recommendations.",
                "A Lucid Marketing survey found that 68% of individuals consulted friends and relatives before purchasing home electronics - more than the half who used search engines to find product information [3].",
                "Several studies have attempted to model just this kind of network influence.",
                "Richardson and Domingos [14] used Epinions trusted reviewer network to construct an algorithm to maximize viral marketing efficiency assuming that individuals probability of purchasing a product depends on the opinions on the trusted peers in their network.",
                "Kempe, Kleinberg and Tardos [8] evaluate the efficiency of several algorithms for maximizing the size of influence set given various models of adoption.",
                "While these models address the question of maximizing the spread of influence in a network, they are based on assumed rather than measured influence effects.",
                "In contrast, in our study we are able to directly observe the effectiveness of person to person word of mouth advertising for hundreds of thousands of products for the first time.",
                "We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial purchase of a product.",
                "However, occasionally a product will propagate through a very active recommendation network.",
                "We propose a simple <br>stochastic model</br> that seems to explain the propagation of recommendations.",
                "Moreover, the characteristics of recommendation networks influence the purchase patterns of their members.",
                "For example, individuals likelihood of purchasing a product initially increases as they receive additional recommendations for it, but a saturation point is quickly reached.",
                "Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.",
                "We also propose models to identify products for which viral marketing is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often.",
                "We also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are likely to be shopping online or reading email.",
                "We report on these and other findings in the following sections. 2.",
                "THE RECOMMENDATION NETWORK 2.1 Dataset description Our analysis focuses on the recommendation referral program run by a large retailer.",
                "The program rules were as follows.",
                "Each time a person purchases a book, music, or a movie he or she is given the option of sending emails recommending the item to friends.",
                "The first person to purchase the same item through a referral link in the email gets a 10% discount.",
                "When this happens the sender of the recommendation receives a 10% credit on their purchase.",
                "The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users.",
                "The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003.",
                "In total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos.",
                "In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailers website to obtain product categories, reviews and ratings for all products.",
                "Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).",
                "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
                "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor.",
                "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product.",
                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
                "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
                "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
                "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
                "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 Recommendation network statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the product and product price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount.",
                "The sender and receiver IDs were shadowed.",
                "We represent this data set as a directed multi graph.",
                "The nodes represent customers, and a directed edge contains all the information about the recommendation.",
                "The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended product p to customer j at time t. The typical process generating edges in the recommendation network is as follows: a node i first buys a product p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn.",
                "The j nodes can they buy the product and further recommend it.",
                "The only way for a node to recommend a product is to first buy it.",
                "Note that even if all nodes j buy a product, only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase (within a week after the recommendation) will be marked by a buy-bit.",
                "Because the buy-bit is set only for the first person who acts on a recommendation, we identify additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations must be preceded by a purchase.",
                "We call this type of evidence of purchase a buyedge.",
                "Note that buy-edges provide only a lower bound on the total number of purchases without discounts.",
                "It is possible for a customer to not be the first to act on a recommendation and also to not recommend the product to others.",
                "Unfortunately, this was not recorded in the data set.",
                "We consider, however, the buy-bits and buy-edges as proxies for the total number of purchases through recommendations.",
                "For each product group we took recommendations on all products from the group and created a network.",
                "Table 1 229 0 1 2 3 4 x 10 6 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 x 10 4 number of nodes sizeofgiantcomponent by month quadratic fit 0 10 20 0 2 4 x 10 6 m (month) n # nodes 1.7*10 6 m 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 kp (recommendations by a person for a product) N(x>=k p ) level 0 γ = 2.6 level 1 γ = 2.0 level 2 γ = 1.5 level 3 γ = 1.2 level 4 γ = 1.2 (a) Network growth (b) Recommending by level Figure 1: (a) The size of the largest connected component of customers over time.",

                "A power law exponent γ is fitted to all but the tail. (first 7 columns) shows the sizes of various product group recommendation networks with p being the total number of products in the product group, n the total number of nodes spanned by the group recommendation network and e the number of edges (recommendations).",
                "The column eu shows the number of unique edges - disregarding multiple recommendations between the same source and recipient.",
                "In terms of the number of different items, there are by far the most music CDs, followed by books and videos.",
                "There is a surprisingly small number of DVD titles.",
                "On the other hand, DVDs account for more half of all recommendations in the dataset.",
                "The DVD network is also the most dense, having about 10 recommendations per node, while books and music have about 2 recommendations per node and videos have only a bit more than 1 recommendation per node.",
                "Music recommendations reached about the same number of people as DVDs but used more than 5 times fewer recommendations to achieve the same coverage of the nodes.",
                "Book recommendations reached by far the most people - 2.8 million.",
                "Notice that all networks have a very small number of unique edges.",
                "For books, videos and music the number of unique edges is smaller than the number of nodes - this suggests that the networks are highly disconnected [5].",
                "Figure 1(a) shows the fraction of nodes in largest weakly connected component over time.",
                "Notice the component is very small.",
                "Even if we compose a network using all the recommendations in the dataset, the largest connected component contains less than 2.5% (100,420) of the nodes, and the second largest component has only 600 nodes.",
                "Still, some smaller communities, numbering in the tens of thousands of purchasers of DVDs in categories such as westerns, classics and Japanese animated films (anime), had connected components spanning about 20% of their members.",
                "The insert in figure 1(a) shows the growth of the customer base over time.",
                "Surprisingly it was linear, adding on average 165,000 new users each month, which is an indication that the service itself was not spreading epidemically.",
                "Further evidence of non-viral spread is provided by the relatively high percentage (94%) of users who made their first recommendation without having previously received one.",
                "Back to table 1: given the total number of recommendations e and purchases (bb + be) influenced by recommendations we can estimate how many recommendations need to be independently sent over the network to induce a new purchase.",
                "Using this metric books have the most influential recommendations followed by DVDs and music.",
                "For books one out of 69 recommendations resulted in a purchase.",
                "For DVDs it increases to 108 recommendations per purchase and further increases to 136 for music and 203 for video.",
                "Even with these simple counts we can make the first few observations.",
                "It seems that some people got quite heavily involved in the recommendation program, and that they tended to recommend a large number of products to the same set of friends (since the number of unique edges is so small).",
                "This shows that people tend to buy more DVDs and also like to recommend them to their friends, while they seem to be more conservative with books.",
                "One possible reason is that a book is bigger time investment than a DVD: one usually needs several days to read a book, while a DVD can be viewed in a single evening.",
                "One external factor which may be affecting the recommendation patterns for DVDs is the existence of referral websites (www.dvdtalk.com).",
                "On these websites people, who want to buy a DVD and get a discount, would ask for recommendations.",
                "This way there would be recommendations made between people who dont really know each other but rather have an economic incentive to cooperate.",
                "We were not able to find similar referral sharing sites for books or CDs. 2.3 Forward recommendations Not all people who make a purchase also decide to give recommendations.",
                "So we estimate what fraction of people that purchase also decide to recommend forward.",
                "To obtain this information we can only use the nodes with purchases that resulted in a discount.",
                "The last 3 columns of table 1 show that only about a third of the people that purchase also recommend the product forward.",
                "The ratio of forward recommendations is much higher for DVDs than for other kinds of products.",
                "Videos also have a higher ratio of forward recommendations, while books have the lowest.",
                "This shows that people are most keen on recommending movies, while more conservative when recommending books and music.",
                "Figure 1(b) shows the cumulative out-degree distribution, that is the number of people who sent out at least kp recommendations, for a product.",
                "It shows that the deeper an individual is in the cascade, if they choose to make recommendations, they tend to recommend to a greater number of people on average (the distribution has a higher variance).",
                "This effect is probably due to only very heavily recommended products producing large enough cascades to reach a certain depth.",
                "We also observe that the probability of an individual making a recommendation at all (which can only occur if they make a purchase), declines after an initial increase as one gets deeper into the cascade. 2.4 Identifying cascades As customers continue forwarding recommendations, they contribute to the formation of cascades.",
                "In order to identify cascades, i.e. the causal propagation of recommendations, we track successful recommendations as they influence purchases and further recommendations.",
                "We define a recommendation to be successful if it reached a node before its first purchase.",

                "We delete late recommendations - all incoming recommendations that happened after the first purchase of the product.",
                "This way we make the network time increasing or causal - for each node all incoming edges (recommendations) occurred before all outgoing edges.",

                "Most product recommendation networks consist of a large number of small disconnected components where we do not observe cascades.",
                "Then there is usually a small number of relatively small components with recommendations successfully propagating.",
                "This observation is reflected in the heavy tailed distribution of cascade sizes (see figure 4), having a power-law exponent close to 1 for DVDs in particular.",

                "The most active person made 83,729 recommendations and purchased 4,416 different items.",
                "Finally, we also sometimes observe collisions, where nodes receive recommendations from two or more sources.",
                "A detailed enumeration and analysis of observed topological cascade patterns for this dataset is made in [10]. 2.5 The recommendation propagation model A simple model can help explain how the wide variance we observe in the number of recommendations made by individuals can lead to power-laws in cascade sizes (figure 4).",
                "The model assumes that each recipient of a recommendation will forward it to others if its value exceeds an arbitrary threshold that the individual sets for herself.",

                "Notice that, because of the probabilistic nature of the threshold being exceeded, one can only compute the final distribution of recommendation chain lengths, which we now proceed to do.",
                "Subtracting from both sides of this equation the term Nt and diving by it we obtain N(t+1) − Nt Nt = pt − 1 (2) Summing both sides from the initial time to some very large time T and assuming that for long times the numerator is smaller than the denominator (a reasonable assumption) we get dN N = pt (3) The left hand integral is just ln(N), and the right hand side is a sum of random variables, which in the limit of a very large uncorrelated number of recommendations is normally distributed (central limit theorem).",
                "This means that the logarithm of the number of messages is normally distributed, or equivalently, that the number of messages passed is log-normally distributed.",
                "In other words the probability density for N is given by P(N) = 1 N √ 2πσ2 exp −(ln(N) − μ)2 2σ2 (4) which, for large variances describes a behavior whereby the typical number of recommendations is small (the mode of the distribution) but there are unlikely events of large chains of recommendations which are also observable.",
                "Furthermore, for large variances, the lognormal distribution can behave like a power law for a range of values.",
                "In order to see this, take the logarithms on both sides of the equation (equivalent to a log-log plot) and one obtains ln(P(N)) = − ln(N) − ln( √ 2πσ2) − (ln (N) − μ)2 2σ2 (5) So, for large σ, the last term of the right hand side goes to zero, and since the the second term is a constant one obtains a power law behavior with exponent value of minus one.",
                "There are other models which produce power-law distributions of cascade sizes, but we present ours for its simplicity, since it does not depend on network topology [6] or critical thresholds in the probability of a recommendation being accepted [18]. 3.",
                "SUCCESS OF RECOMMENDATIONS So far we only looked into the aggregate statistics of the recommendation network.",
                "Next, we ask questions about the effectiveness of recommendations in the recommendation network itself.",
                "First, we analyze the probability of purchasing as one gets more and more recommendations.",
                "Next, we measure recommendation effectiveness as two people exchange more and more recommendations.",
                "Lastly, we observe the recommendation network from the perspective of the sender of the recommendation.",
                "Does a node that makes more recommendations also influence more purchases? 3.1 Probability of buying versus number of incoming recommendations First, we examine how the probability of purchasing changes as one gets more and more recommendations.",

                "So, how many recommendations are too many?",
                "Figure 5 shows the probability of purchasing a product as a function of the number of incoming recommendations on the product.",

                "The maximum was 30 incoming recommendations.",
                "For these reasons we cut-off the plot when the number of observations becomes too small and the error bars too large.",

                "For the experiment we consider only node pairs (u, v), where there were at least a total of 10 recommendations sent from u to v. We perform the experiment using only recommendations from the same product group.",

                "For books we observe that the effectiveness of recommendation remains about constant up to 3 exchanged recommendations.",

                "Now we look from the viewpoint of the sender.",
                "The two interesting questions are: how does the probability of getting a 10% credit change with the number of outgoing recommendations; and given a number of outgoing recommendations, how many purchases will they influence?",
                "One would expect that recommendations would be the most effective when recommended to the right subset of friends.",
                "If one is very selective and recommends to too few friends, then the chances of success are slim.",
                "One the other hand, recommending to everyone and spamming them with recommendations may have limited returns as well.",
                "The top row of figure 7 shows how the average number of purchases changes with the number of outgoing recommendations.",
                "For books, music, and videos the number of purchases soon saturates: it grows fast up to around 10 outgoing recommendations and then the trend either slows or starts to drop.",
                "DVDs exhibit different behavior, with the expected number of purchases increasing throughout.",
                "But if we plot the probability of getting a 10% credit as a function of the number of outgoing recommendations, as in the bottom row of figure 7, we see that the success of DVD recommendations saturates as well, while books, videos and music have qualitatively similar trends.",
                "The difference in the curves for DVD recommendations points to the presence of collisions in the dense DVD network, which has 10 recommendations per node and around 400 per product - an order of magnitude more than other product groups.",

                "At the same time, DVD recommenders tend to send out many more recommendations, only one of which can result in a discount.",
                "Individuals then often miss their chance of a discount, which is reflected in the high ratio (78%) of recommended DVD purchases that did not a get discount (see table 1, columns bb and be).",

                "We also measure the variation in intensity by time of day for three different activities in the recommendation system: recommendations (figure 9(a)), all purchases (figure 9(b)), and finally just the purchases which resulted in a discount (figure 9(c)).",

                "The purchases that resulted in a discount look like a negative image of the first two figures.",
                "This means that most of discounted purchases happened in the morning when the traffic (number of purchases/recommendations) on the retailers website was low.",
                "This makes a lot of sense since most of the recommendations happened during the day, and if the person wanted to get the discount by being the first one to purchase, she had the highest chances when the traffic on the website was the lowest. 5.",

                "One is that people feel more confident reviewing fiction than technical books.",

                "Yet another explanation is that the median price of a work of fiction is lower than that of a technical book.",

                "Next, we measure the per category efficacy of recommendations by observing the ratio of the number of purchases occurring within a week following a recommendation to the number of recommenders for each book subject category (column b of table 2).",

                "Recommendations are also more likely to be accepted for certain religious categories: 4.3% for Christian living and theology and 4.8% for Bibles.",
                "In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower recommendation effectiveness.",

                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple <br>stochastic model</br> that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",
                "So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread. 8.",

                "Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]).",
                "But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.",
                "We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised viral marketing program.",
                "The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.",

                "Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication.",
                "Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.",

                "Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.",
                "Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.",
                "At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.",
                "Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a fat tail phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items.",

                "The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.",

                "These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.",
                "It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.",

                "Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.",
                "We also propose models to identify products for which viral marketing is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often.",
                "We also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are likely to be shopping online or reading email.",

                "Each time a person purchases a book, music, or a movie he or she is given the option of sending emails recommending the item to friends.",
                "The first person to purchase the same item through a referral link in the email gets a 10% discount.",
                "When this happens the sender of the recommendation receives a 10% credit on their purchase.",
                "The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users.",
                "The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003.",
                "In total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos.",
                "In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailers website to obtain product categories, reviews and ratings for all products.",
                "Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).",
                "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
                "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor.",
                "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product.",
                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
                "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
                "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
                "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
                "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 <br>recommendation network</br> statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the product and product price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount.",
                "The sender and receiver IDs were shadowed.",
                "We represent this data set as a directed multi graph.",
                "The nodes represent customers, and a directed edge contains all the information about the recommendation.",
                "The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended product p to customer j at time t. The typical process generating edges in the <br>recommendation network</br> is as follows: a node i first buys a product p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn.",
                "The j nodes can they buy the product and further recommend it.",
                "The only way for a node to recommend a product is to first buy it.",
                "Note that even if all nodes j buy a product, only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase (within a week after the recommendation) will be marked by a buy-bit.",
                "Because the buy-bit is set only for the first person who acts on a recommendation, we identify additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations must be preceded by a purchase.",
                "We call this type of evidence of purchase a buyedge.",
                "Note that buy-edges provide only a lower bound on the total number of purchases without discounts.",
                "It is possible for a customer to not be the first to act on a recommendation and also to not recommend the product to others.",
                "Unfortunately, this was not recorded in the data set.",
                "We consider, however, the buy-bits and buy-edges as proxies for the total number of purchases through recommendations.",

                "There is a surprisingly small number of DVD titles.",
                "On the other hand, DVDs account for more half of all recommendations in the dataset.",
                "The DVD network is also the most dense, having about 10 recommendations per node, while books and music have about 2 recommendations per node and videos have only a bit more than 1 recommendation per node.",
                "Music recommendations reached about the same number of people as DVDs but used more than 5 times fewer recommendations to achieve the same coverage of the nodes.",
                "Book recommendations reached by far the most people - 2.8 million.",
                "Notice that all networks have a very small number of unique edges.",
                "For books, videos and music the number of unique edges is smaller than the number of nodes - this suggests that the networks are highly disconnected [5].",
                "Figure 1(a) shows the fraction of nodes in largest weakly connected component over time.",
                "Notice the component is very small.",
                "Even if we compose a network using all the recommendations in the dataset, the largest connected component contains less than 2.5% (100,420) of the nodes, and the second largest component has only 600 nodes.",
                "Still, some smaller communities, numbering in the tens of thousands of purchasers of DVDs in categories such as westerns, classics and Japanese animated films (anime), had connected components spanning about 20% of their members.",
                "The insert in figure 1(a) shows the growth of the customer base over time.",
                "Surprisingly it was linear, adding on average 165,000 new users each month, which is an indication that the service itself was not spreading epidemically.",
                "Further evidence of non-viral spread is provided by the relatively high percentage (94%) of users who made their first recommendation without having previously received one.",
                "Back to table 1: given the total number of recommendations e and purchases (bb + be) influenced by recommendations we can estimate how many recommendations need to be independently sent over the network to induce a new purchase.",
                "Using this metric books have the most influential recommendations followed by DVDs and music.",
                "For books one out of 69 recommendations resulted in a purchase.",
                "For DVDs it increases to 108 recommendations per purchase and further increases to 136 for music and 203 for video.",
                "Even with these simple counts we can make the first few observations.",
                "It seems that some people got quite heavily involved in the recommendation program, and that they tended to recommend a large number of products to the same set of friends (since the number of unique edges is so small).",
                "This shows that people tend to buy more DVDs and also like to recommend them to their friends, while they seem to be more conservative with books.",
                "One possible reason is that a book is bigger time investment than a DVD: one usually needs several days to read a book, while a DVD can be viewed in a single evening.",
                "One external factor which may be affecting the recommendation patterns for DVDs is the existence of referral websites (www.dvdtalk.com).",
                "On these websites people, who want to buy a DVD and get a discount, would ask for recommendations.",
                "This way there would be recommendations made between people who dont really know each other but rather have an economic incentive to cooperate.",
                "We were not able to find similar referral sharing sites for books or CDs. 2.3 Forward recommendations Not all people who make a purchase also decide to give recommendations.",
                "So we estimate what fraction of people that purchase also decide to recommend forward.",
                "To obtain this information we can only use the nodes with purchases that resulted in a discount.",
                "The last 3 columns of table 1 show that only about a third of the people that purchase also recommend the product forward.",
                "The ratio of forward recommendations is much higher for DVDs than for other kinds of products.",
                "Videos also have a higher ratio of forward recommendations, while books have the lowest.",
                "This shows that people are most keen on recommending movies, while more conservative when recommending books and music.",
                "Figure 1(b) shows the cumulative out-degree distribution, that is the number of people who sent out at least kp recommendations, for a product.",
                "It shows that the deeper an individual is in the cascade, if they choose to make recommendations, they tend to recommend to a greater number of people on average (the distribution has a higher variance).",
                "This effect is probably due to only very heavily recommended products producing large enough cascades to reach a certain depth.",
                "We also observe that the probability of an individual making a recommendation at all (which can only occur if they make a purchase), declines after an initial increase as one gets deeper into the cascade. 2.4 Identifying cascades As customers continue forwarding recommendations, they contribute to the formation of cascades.",

                "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Although the retailer may have hoped to boost its revenues through viral marketing, the additional purchases that resulted from recommendations are just a drop in the bucket of sales that occur through the website.",
                "Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.",
                "Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.",
                "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the <br>recommendation network</br>.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",
                "So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread. 8.",

                "INTRODUCTION With consumers showing increasing resistance to traditional forms of advertising such as TV or newspaper ads, marketers have turned to alternate strategies, including viral marketing.",
                "Viral marketing exploits existing social networks by encouraging customers to share product information with their friends.",
                "Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]).",
                "But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.",
                "We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised viral marketing program.",
                "The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.",
                "Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor influencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for advertisers to tap into.",
                "Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication.",
                "Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.",
                "Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7].",
                "Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.",
                "Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.",
                "At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.",
                "Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a fat tail phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items.",
                "On Amazon.com, somewhere between 20 to 40 percent of unit sales fall outside of its top 100,000 ranked products [2].",
                "Rhapsody, a streaming-music service, streams more tracks outside than inside its top 10,000 tunes [1].",
                "Effectively advertising these niche products using traditional advertising approaches is impractical.",
                "Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the consumer, who would benefit from learning about new products.",
                "The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.",
                "Quantitative marketing techniques have been proposed [12], and the rating of products and merchants has been shown to effect the likelihood of an item being bought [13, 4].",
                "Of further help to the consumer are collaborative filtering recommendations of the form people who bought x also bought y feature [11].",
                "These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.",
                "It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.",
                "Our friends are also acquainted with our needs and tastes, and can make appropriate recommendations.",
                "A Lucid Marketing survey found that 68% of individuals consulted friends and relatives before purchasing home electronics - more than the half who used search engines to find product information [3].",

                "Richardson and Domingos [14] used Epinions trusted reviewer network to construct an algorithm to maximize viral marketing efficiency assuming that individuals probability of purchasing a product depends on the opinions on the trusted peers in their network.",

                "While these models address the question of maximizing the spread of influence in a network, they are based on assumed rather than measured influence effects.",
                "In contrast, in our study we are able to directly observe the effectiveness of person to person word of mouth advertising for hundreds of thousands of products for the first time.",
                "We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial <br>purchase</br> of a product.",

                "We propose a simple stochastic model that seems to explain the propagation of recommendations.",
                "Moreover, the characteristics of recommendation networks influence the <br>purchase</br> patterns of their members.",
                "For example, individuals likelihood of purchasing a product initially increases as they receive additional recommendations for it, but a saturation point is quickly reached.",
                "Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.",
                "We also propose models to identify products for which viral marketing is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a <br>purchase</br> more often.",
                "We also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are likely to be shopping online or reading email.",

                "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",

                "While on average recommendations are not very effective at inducing purchases and do not spread very far, we present a model that successfully identifies <br>product</br> and pricing categories for which viral marketing seems to be very effective.",

                "INTRODUCTION With consumers showing increasing resistance to traditional forms of advertising such as TV or newspaper ads, marketers have turned to alternate strategies, including viral marketing.",
                "Viral marketing exploits existing social networks by encouraging customers to share <br>product</br> information with their friends.",
                "Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]).",
                "But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.",
                "We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised viral marketing program.",
                "The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.",
                "Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor influencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for advertisers to tap into.",
                "Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing, because the <br>product</br> can be observed or advertised as part of the communication.",
                "Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.",
                "Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7].",
                "Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.",
                "Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.",
                "At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.",
                "Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a fat tail phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items.",
                "On Amazon.com, somewhere between 20 to 40 percent of unit sales fall outside of its top 100,000 ranked products [2].",

                "Effectively advertising these niche products using traditional advertising approaches is impractical.",
                "Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the consumer, who would benefit from learning about new products.",
                "The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online <br>product</br> and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized <br>product</br> comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.",
                "Quantitative marketing techniques have been proposed [12], and the rating of products and merchants has been shown to effect the likelihood of an item being bought [13, 4].",

                "These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.",
                "It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.",
                "Our friends are also acquainted with our needs and tastes, and can make appropriate recommendations.",
                "A Lucid Marketing survey found that 68% of individuals consulted friends and relatives before purchasing home electronics - more than the half who used search engines to find <br>product</br> information [3].",

                "Richardson and Domingos [14] used Epinions trusted reviewer network to construct an algorithm to maximize viral marketing efficiency assuming that individuals probability of purchasing a <br>product</br> depends on the opinions on the trusted peers in their network.",

                "We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial purchase of a <br>product</br>.",
                "However, occasionally a <br>product</br> will propagate through a very active recommendation network.",
                "We propose a simple stochastic model that seems to explain the propagation of recommendations.",

                "Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.",
                "We also propose models to identify products for which viral marketing is effective: We find that the category and price of <br>product</br> plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often.",
                "We also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are likely to be shopping online or reading email.",

                "Each time a person purchases a book, music, or a movie he or she is given the option of sending emails recommending the item to friends.",
                "The first person to purchase the same item through a referral link in the email gets a 10% discount.",
                "When this happens the sender of the recommendation receives a 10% credit on their purchase.",
                "The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users.",
                "The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003.",
                "In total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main <br>product</br> groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos.",
                "In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailers website to obtain <br>product</br> categories, reviews and ratings for all products.",
                "Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).",
                "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
                "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the <br>product</br> through the same vendor.",
                "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the <br>product</br>.",
                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a <br>product</br> they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
                "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
                "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
                "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the <br>product</br> because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
                "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the <br>product</br>, it might not be based on a direct observation of the <br>product</br>.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 Recommendation network statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the <br>product</br> and <br>product</br> price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount.",
                "The sender and receiver IDs were shadowed.",
                "We represent this data set as a directed multi graph.",
                "The nodes represent customers, and a directed edge contains all the information about the recommendation.",
                "The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended <br>product</br> p to customer j at time t. The typical process generating edges in the recommendation network is as follows: a node i first buys a <br>product</br> p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn.",
                "The j nodes can they buy the <br>product</br> and further recommend it.",
                "The only way for a node to recommend a <br>product</br> is to first buy it.",
                "Note that even if all nodes j buy a <br>product</br>, only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase (within a week after the recommendation) will be marked by a buy-bit.",
                "Because the buy-bit is set only for the first person who acts on a recommendation, we identify additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations must be preceded by a purchase.",
                "We call this type of evidence of purchase a buyedge.",
                "Note that buy-edges provide only a lower bound on the total number of purchases without discounts.",
                "It is possible for a customer to not be the first to act on a recommendation and also to not recommend the <br>product</br> to others.",
                "Unfortunately, this was not recorded in the data set.",
                "We consider, however, the buy-bits and buy-edges as proxies for the total number of purchases through recommendations.",
                "For each <br>product</br> group we took recommendations on all products from the group and created a network.",

                "The column eu shows the number of unique edges - disregarding multiple recommendations between the same source and recipient.",
                "In terms of the number of different items, there are by far the most music CDs, followed by books and videos.",
                "There is a surprisingly small number of DVD titles.",
                "On the other hand, DVDs account for more half of all recommendations in the dataset.",
                "The DVD network is also the most dense, having about 10 recommendations per node, while books and music have about 2 recommendations per node and videos have only a bit more than 1 recommendation per node.",
                "Music recommendations reached about the same number of people as DVDs but used more than 5 times fewer recommendations to achieve the same coverage of the nodes.",
                "Book recommendations reached by far the most people - 2.8 million.",
                "Notice that all networks have a very small number of unique edges.",
                "For books, videos and music the number of unique edges is smaller than the number of nodes - this suggests that the networks are highly disconnected [5].",
                "Figure 1(a) shows the fraction of nodes in largest weakly connected component over time.",
                "Notice the component is very small.",
                "Even if we compose a network using all the recommendations in the dataset, the largest connected component contains less than 2.5% (100,420) of the nodes, and the second largest component has only 600 nodes.",
                "Still, some smaller communities, numbering in the tens of thousands of purchasers of DVDs in categories such as westerns, classics and Japanese animated films (anime), had connected components spanning about 20% of their members.",
                "The insert in figure 1(a) shows the growth of the customer base over time.",
                "Surprisingly it was linear, adding on average 165,000 new users each month, which is an indication that the service itself was not spreading epidemically.",
                "Further evidence of non-viral spread is provided by the relatively high percentage (94%) of users who made their first recommendation without having previously received one.",
                "Back to table 1: given the total number of recommendations e and purchases (bb + be) influenced by recommendations we can estimate how many recommendations need to be independently sent over the network to induce a new purchase.",
                "Using this metric books have the most influential recommendations followed by DVDs and music.",
                "For books one out of 69 recommendations resulted in a purchase.",
                "For DVDs it increases to 108 recommendations per purchase and further increases to 136 for music and 203 for video.",
                "Even with these simple counts we can make the first few observations.",
                "It seems that some people got quite heavily involved in the recommendation program, and that they tended to recommend a large number of products to the same set of friends (since the number of unique edges is so small).",
                "This shows that people tend to buy more DVDs and also like to recommend them to their friends, while they seem to be more conservative with books.",
                "One possible reason is that a book is bigger time investment than a DVD: one usually needs several days to read a book, while a DVD can be viewed in a single evening.",
                "One external factor which may be affecting the recommendation patterns for DVDs is the existence of referral websites (www.dvdtalk.com).",
                "On these websites people, who want to buy a DVD and get a discount, would ask for recommendations.",
                "This way there would be recommendations made between people who dont really know each other but rather have an economic incentive to cooperate.",
                "We were not able to find similar referral sharing sites for books or CDs. 2.3 Forward recommendations Not all people who make a purchase also decide to give recommendations.",
                "So we estimate what fraction of people that purchase also decide to recommend forward.",
                "To obtain this information we can only use the nodes with purchases that resulted in a discount.",
                "The last 3 columns of table 1 show that only about a third of the people that purchase also recommend the <br>product</br> forward.",
                "The ratio of forward recommendations is much higher for DVDs than for other kinds of products.",
                "Videos also have a higher ratio of forward recommendations, while books have the lowest.",
                "This shows that people are most keen on recommending movies, while more conservative when recommending books and music.",
                "Figure 1(b) shows the cumulative out-degree distribution, that is the number of people who sent out at least kp recommendations, for a <br>product</br>.",
                "It shows that the deeper an individual is in the cascade, if they choose to make recommendations, they tend to recommend to a greater number of people on average (the distribution has a higher variance).",
                "This effect is probably due to only very heavily recommended products producing large enough cascades to reach a certain depth.",
                "We also observe that the probability of an individual making a recommendation at all (which can only occur if they make a purchase), declines after an initial increase as one gets deeper into the cascade. 2.4 Identifying cascades As customers continue forwarding recommendations, they contribute to the formation of cascades.",
                "In order to identify cascades, i.e. the causal propagation of recommendations, we track successful recommendations as they influence purchases and further recommendations.",
                "We define a recommendation to be successful if it reached a node before its first purchase.",

                "Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.",
                "Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.",
                "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a <br>product</br> increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a <br>product</br>, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of <br>product</br> reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",
                "So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread. 8.",

                "Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).",
                "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
                "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor.",
                "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product.",
                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
                "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
                "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
                "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
                "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 Recommendation network statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the product and product price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount.",
                "The sender and receiver IDs were shadowed.",
                "We represent this data set as a directed multi graph.",
                "The nodes represent customers, and a directed edge contains all the information about the recommendation.",
                "The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended product p to customer j at time t. The typical process generating edges in the recommendation network is as follows: a node i first buys a product p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn.",
                "The j nodes can they buy the product and further recommend it.",
                "The only way for a node to recommend a product is to first buy it.",
                "Note that even if all nodes j buy a product, only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase (within a week after the recommendation) will be marked by a buy-bit.",
                "Because the buy-bit is set only for the first person who acts on a recommendation, we identify additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations must be preceded by a purchase.",

                "Unfortunately, this was not recorded in the data set.",
                "We consider, however, the buy-bits and buy-edges as proxies for the total number of purchases through recommendations.",

                "For books one out of 69 recommendations resulted in a purchase.",
                "For DVDs it increases to 108 recommendations per purchase and further increases to 136 for music and 203 for video.",
                "Even with these simple counts we can make the first few observations.",
                "It seems that some people got quite heavily involved in the recommendation program, and that they tended to recommend a large number of products to the same set of friends (since the number of unique edges is so small).",
                "This shows that people tend to buy more DVDs and also like to recommend them to their friends, while they seem to be more conservative with books.",

                "One external factor which may be affecting the recommendation patterns for DVDs is the existence of referral websites (www.dvdtalk.com).",
                "On these websites people, who want to buy a DVD and get a discount, would ask for recommendations.",
                "This way there would be recommendations made between people who dont really know each other but rather have an economic incentive to cooperate.",
                "We were not able to find similar referral sharing sites for books or CDs. 2.3 Forward recommendations Not all people who make a purchase also decide to give recommendations.",
                "So we estimate what fraction of people that purchase also decide to recommend forward.",
                "To obtain this information we can only use the nodes with purchases that resulted in a discount.",
                "The last 3 columns of table 1 show that only about a third of the people that purchase also recommend the product forward.",

                "This effect is probably due to only very heavily recommended products producing large enough cascades to reach a certain depth.",
                "We also observe that the probability of an individual making a recommendation at all (which can only occur if they make a purchase), declines after an initial increase as one gets deeper into the cascade. 2.4 Identifying cascades As customers continue forwarding recommendations, they contribute to the formation of cascades.",
                "In order to identify cascades, i.e. the causal propagation of recommendations, we track successful recommendations as they influence purchases and further recommendations.",

                "Recommendations are also more likely to be accepted for certain religious categories: 4.3% for Christian living and theology and 4.8% for Bibles.",
                "In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower recommendation effectiveness.",

                "Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.",

                "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",

Huberman HP Labs Palo Alto, CA 94304 bernardo.huberman@hp.com ABSTRACT We present an analysis of a person-to-person recommendation network, consisting of 4 million people who made 16 million recommendations on half a million products.",
                "We observe the propagation of recommendations and the cascade sizes, which we explain by a simple stochastic model.",
                "We then establish how the recommendation network grows over time and how effective it is from the viewpoint of the sender and receiver of the recommendations.",
                "While on average recommendations are not very effective at inducing purchases and do not spread very far, we present a model that successfully identifies product and pricing categories for which viral marketing seems to be very effective.",

                "INTRODUCTION With consumers showing increasing resistance to traditional forms of advertising such as TV or newspaper ads, marketers have turned to alternate strategies, including viral marketing.",
                "Viral marketing exploits existing social networks by encouraging customers to share product information with their friends.",
                "Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]).",
                "But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.",
                "We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised viral marketing program.",
                "The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.",
                "Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor influencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for advertisers to tap into.",
                "Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication.",
                "Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.",
                "Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7].",
                "Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.",
                "Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.",
                "At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.",
                "Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a fat tail phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items.",
                "On Amazon.com, somewhere between 20 to 40 percent of unit sales fall outside of its top 100,000 ranked products [2].",

                "Effectively advertising these niche products using traditional advertising approaches is impractical.",
                "Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the <br>consumer</br>, who would benefit from learning about new products.",
                "The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.",
                "Quantitative marketing techniques have been proposed [12], and the rating of products and merchants has been shown to effect the likelihood of an item being bought [13, 4].",

                "These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.",
                "It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.",
                "Our friends are also acquainted with our needs and tastes, and can make appropriate recommendations.",
                "A Lucid Marketing survey found that 68% of individuals consulted friends and relatives before purchasing home electronics - more than the half who used search engines to find product information [3].",

                "Richardson and Domingos [14] used Epinions trusted reviewer network to construct an algorithm to maximize viral marketing efficiency assuming that individuals probability of purchasing a product depends on the opinions on the trusted peers in their network.",

                "In contrast, in our study we are able to directly observe the effectiveness of person to person word of mouth advertising for hundreds of thousands of products for the first time.",
                "We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial purchase of a product.",
                "However, occasionally a product will propagate through a very active recommendation network.",
                "We propose a simple stochastic model that seems to explain the propagation of recommendations.",
                "Moreover, the characteristics of recommendation networks influence the purchase patterns of their members.",
                "For example, individuals likelihood of purchasing a product initially increases as they receive additional recommendations for it, but a saturation point is quickly reached.",
                "Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.",
                "We also propose models to identify products for which viral marketing is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often.",
                "We also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are likely to be shopping online or reading email.",
                "We report on these and other findings in the following sections. 2.",
                "THE RECOMMENDATION NETWORK 2.1 Dataset description Our analysis focuses on the recommendation referral program run by a large retailer.",
                "The program rules were as follows.",
                "Each time a person purchases a book, music, or a movie he or she is given the option of sending emails recommending the item to friends.",
                "The first person to purchase the same item through a referral link in the email gets a 10% discount.",
                "When this happens the sender of the recommendation receives a 10% credit on their purchase.",
                "The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users.",
                "The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003.",
                "In total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos.",
                "In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailers website to obtain product categories, reviews and ratings for all products.",
                "Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).",
                "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
                "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor.",
                "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product.",
                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
                "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
                "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
                "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
                "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 Recommendation network statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the product and product price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount.",
                "The sender and receiver IDs were shadowed.",
                "We represent this data set as a directed multi graph.",
                "The nodes represent customers, and a directed edge contains all the information about the recommendation.",
                "The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended product p to customer j at time t. The typical process generating edges in the recommendation network is as follows: a node i first buys a product p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn.",
                "The j nodes can they buy the product and further recommend it.",
                "The only way for a node to recommend a product is to first buy it.",
                "Note that even if all nodes j buy a product, only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase (within a week after the recommendation) will be marked by a buy-bit.",
                "Because the buy-bit is set only for the first person who acts on a recommendation, we identify additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations must be preceded by a purchase.",
                "We call this type of evidence of purchase a buyedge.",
                "Note that buy-edges provide only a lower bound on the total number of purchases without discounts.",
                "It is possible for a customer to not be the first to act on a recommendation and also to not recommend the product to others.",
                "Unfortunately, this was not recorded in the data set.",
                "We consider, however, the buy-bits and buy-edges as proxies for the total number of purchases through recommendations.",
                "For each product group we took recommendations on all products from the group and created a network.",

                "There is a surprisingly small number of DVD titles.",
                "On the other hand, DVDs account for more half of all recommendations in the dataset.",
                "The DVD network is also the most dense, having about 10 recommendations per node, while books and music have about 2 recommendations per node and videos have only a bit more than 1 recommendation per node.",
                "Music recommendations reached about the same number of people as DVDs but used more than 5 times fewer recommendations to achieve the same coverage of the nodes.",
                "Book recommendations reached by far the most people - 2.8 million.",
                "Notice that all networks have a very small number of unique edges.",
                "For books, videos and music the number of unique edges is smaller than the number of nodes - this suggests that the networks are highly disconnected [5].",
                "Figure 1(a) shows the fraction of nodes in largest weakly connected component over time.",
                "Notice the component is very small.",
                "Even if we compose a network using all the recommendations in the dataset, the largest connected component contains less than 2.5% (100,420) of the nodes, and the second largest component has only 600 nodes.",
                "Still, some smaller communities, numbering in the tens of thousands of purchasers of DVDs in categories such as westerns, classics and Japanese animated films (anime), had connected components spanning about 20% of their members.",
                "The insert in figure 1(a) shows the growth of the customer base over time.",
                "Surprisingly it was linear, adding on average 165,000 new users each month, which is an indication that the service itself was not spreading epidemically.",
                "Further evidence of non-viral spread is provided by the relatively high percentage (94%) of users who made their first recommendation without having previously received one.",
                "Back to table 1: given the total number of recommendations e and purchases (bb + be) influenced by recommendations we can estimate how many recommendations need to be independently sent over the network to induce a new purchase.",
                "Using this metric books have the most influential recommendations followed by DVDs and music.",
                "For books one out of 69 recommendations resulted in a purchase.",
                "For DVDs it increases to 108 recommendations per purchase and further increases to 136 for music and 203 for video.",
                "Even with these simple counts we can make the first few observations.",
                "It seems that some people got quite heavily involved in the recommendation program, and that they tended to recommend a large number of products to the same set of friends (since the number of unique edges is so small).",
                "This shows that people tend to buy more DVDs and also like to recommend them to their friends, while they seem to be more conservative with books.",
                "One possible reason is that a book is bigger time investment than a DVD: one usually needs several days to read a book, while a DVD can be viewed in a single evening.",
                "One external factor which may be affecting the recommendation patterns for DVDs is the existence of referral websites (www.dvdtalk.com).",
                "On these websites people, who want to buy a DVD and get a discount, would ask for recommendations.",
                "This way there would be recommendations made between people who dont really know each other but rather have an economic incentive to cooperate.",
                "We were not able to find similar referral sharing sites for books or CDs. 2.3 Forward recommendations Not all people who make a purchase also decide to give recommendations.",
                "So we estimate what fraction of people that purchase also decide to recommend forward.",
                "To obtain this information we can only use the nodes with purchases that resulted in a discount.",
                "The last 3 columns of table 1 show that only about a third of the people that purchase also recommend the product forward.",
                "The ratio of forward recommendations is much higher for DVDs than for other kinds of products.",
                "Videos also have a higher ratio of forward recommendations, while books have the lowest.",
                "This shows that people are most keen on recommending movies, while more conservative when recommending books and music.",
                "Figure 1(b) shows the cumulative out-degree distribution, that is the number of people who sent out at least kp recommendations, for a product.",
                "It shows that the deeper an individual is in the cascade, if they choose to make recommendations, they tend to recommend to a greater number of people on average (the distribution has a higher variance).",
                "This effect is probably due to only very heavily recommended products producing large enough cascades to reach a certain depth.",
                "We also observe that the probability of an individual making a recommendation at all (which can only occur if they make a purchase), declines after an initial increase as one gets deeper into the cascade. 2.4 Identifying cascades As customers continue forwarding recommendations, they contribute to the formation of cascades.",
                "In order to identify cascades, i.e. the causal propagation of recommendations, we track successful recommendations as they influence purchases and further recommendations.",
                "We define a recommendation to be successful if it reached a node before its first purchase.",

                "Furthermore, for large variances, the lognormal distribution can behave like a power law for a range of values.",
                "In order to see this, take the logarithms on both sides of the equation (equivalent to a log-log plot) and one obtains ln(P(N)) = − ln(N) − ln( √ 2πσ2) − (ln (N) − μ)2 2σ2 (5) So, for large σ, the last term of the right hand side goes to zero, and since the the second term is a constant one obtains a power law behavior with exponent value of minus one.",

                "The purchases that resulted in a discount look like a negative image of the first two figures.",
                "This means that most of discounted purchases happened in the morning when the traffic (number of purchases/recommendations) on the retailers website was low.",
                "This makes a lot of sense since most of the recommendations happened during the day, and if the person wanted to get the discount by being the first one to purchase, she had the highest chances when the traffic on the website was the lowest. 5.",

                "Yet another explanation is that the median price of a work of fiction is lower than that of a technical book.",

                "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Although the retailer may have hoped to boost its revenues through viral marketing, the additional purchases that resulted from recommendations are just a drop in the bucket of sales that occur through the website.",
                "Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.",
                "Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.",
                "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",
                "So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread. 8.",

                "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
                "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor.",
                "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product.",
                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
                "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
                "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
                "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
                "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 Recommendation network statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the product and product price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount.",

                "The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended product p to customer j at time t. The typical process generating edges in the recommendation network is as follows: a node i first buys a product p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn.",
                "The j nodes can they buy the product and further recommend it.",
                "The only way for a node to recommend a product is to first buy it.",
                "Note that even if all nodes j buy a product, only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase (within a week after the recommendation) will be marked by a buy-bit.",
                "Because the buy-bit is set only for the first person who acts on a recommendation, we identify additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations must be preceded by a purchase.",
                "We call this type of evidence of purchase a buyedge.",
                "Note that buy-edges provide only a lower bound on the total number of purchases without discounts.",

                "Notice the component is very small.",

                "Further evidence of non-viral spread is provided by the relatively high percentage (94%) of users who made their first recommendation without having previously received one.",
                "Back to table 1: given the total number of recommendations e and purchases (bb + be) influenced by recommendations we can estimate how many recommendations need to be independently sent over the network to induce a new purchase.",
                "Using this metric books have the most influential recommendations followed by DVDs and music.",
                "For books one out of 69 recommendations resulted in a purchase.",
                "For DVDs it increases to 108 recommendations per purchase and further increases to 136 for music and 203 for video.",
                "Even with these simple counts we can make the first few observations.",
                "It seems that some people got quite heavily involved in the recommendation program, and that they tended to recommend a large number of products to the same set of friends (since the number of unique edges is so small).",

                "In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower recommendation effectiveness.",

                "There are exceptions of course.",
                "For example, Japanese anime DVDs have a strong following in the US, and this is reflected in their frequency and success in recommendations.",
                "Another example is that of gardening.",
                "In general, recommendations for books relating to gardening have only a modest chance of being accepted, which agrees with the individual prerogative that accompanies this hobby.",
                "At the same time, orchid cultivation can be a highly organized and social activity, with frequent shows and online communities devoted entirely to orchids.",

                "Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.",
                "Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.",
                "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",
                "So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread. 8.",

                "The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.",

                "Recommendations are also more likely to be accepted for certain religious categories: 4.3% for Christian living and theology and 4.8% for Bibles.",
                "In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower recommendation effectiveness.",

                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant <br>probability</br> of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the <br>probability</br> of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low <br>probability</br>.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a <br>probability</br> of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",

Huberman HP Labs Palo Alto, CA 94304 bernardo.huberman@hp.com ABSTRACT We present an analysis of a person-to-person recommendation network, consisting of 4 million people who made 16 million recommendations on half a million products.",
                "We observe the propagation of recommendations and the cascade sizes, which we explain by a simple stochastic model.",
                "We then establish how the recommendation network grows over time and how effective it is from the viewpoint of the sender and receiver of the recommendations.",
                "While on average recommendations are not very effective at inducing purchases and do not spread very far, we present a model that successfully identifies product and pricing categories for which viral marketing seems to be very effective.",

                "INTRODUCTION With consumers showing increasing resistance to traditional forms of advertising such as TV or newspaper ads, marketers have turned to alternate strategies, including viral marketing.",
                "Viral marketing exploits existing social networks by encouraging customers to share product information with their friends.",
                "Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]).",
                "But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.",
                "We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised viral marketing program.",
                "The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.",
                "Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor influencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for advertisers to tap into.",
                "Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication.",
                "Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.",
                "Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7].",
                "Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.",
                "Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.",
                "At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.",
                "Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a fat tail phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items.",
                "On Amazon.com, somewhere between 20 to 40 percent of unit sales fall outside of its top 100,000 ranked products [2].",
                "Rhapsody, a streaming-music service, streams more tracks outside than inside its top 10,000 tunes [1].",
                "Effectively advertising these niche products using traditional advertising approaches is impractical.",
                "Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the consumer, who would benefit from learning about new products.",
                "The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.",
                "Quantitative marketing techniques have been proposed [12], and the rating of products and merchants has been shown to effect the likelihood of an item being bought [13, 4].",
                "Of further help to the consumer are collaborative filtering recommendations of the form people who bought x also bought y feature [11].",
                "These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.",
                "It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.",
                "Our friends are also acquainted with our needs and tastes, and can make appropriate recommendations.",
                "A Lucid Marketing survey found that 68% of individuals consulted friends and relatives before purchasing home electronics - more than the half who used search engines to find product information [3].",
                "Several studies have attempted to model just this kind of network influence.",
                "Richardson and Domingos [14] used Epinions trusted reviewer network to construct an algorithm to maximize viral marketing efficiency assuming that individuals probability of purchasing a product depends on the opinions on the trusted peers in their network.",
                "Kempe, Kleinberg and Tardos [8] evaluate the efficiency of several algorithms for maximizing the size of influence set given various models of adoption.",
                "While these models address the question of maximizing the spread of influence in a network, they are based on assumed rather than measured influence effects.",
                "In contrast, in our study we are able to directly observe the effectiveness of person to person word of mouth advertising for hundreds of thousands of products for the first time.",
                "We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial purchase of a product.",
                "However, occasionally a product will propagate through a very active recommendation network.",
                "We propose a simple stochastic model that seems to explain the propagation of recommendations.",
                "Moreover, the characteristics of recommendation networks influence the purchase patterns of their members.",
                "For example, individuals likelihood of purchasing a product initially increases as they receive additional recommendations for it, but a saturation point is quickly reached.",
                "Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.",
                "We also propose models to identify products for which viral marketing is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often.",
                "We also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are likely to be shopping online or reading email.",
                "We report on these and other findings in the following sections. 2.",
                "THE RECOMMENDATION NETWORK 2.1 Dataset description Our analysis focuses on the recommendation referral program run by a large retailer.",
                "The program rules were as follows.",
                "Each time a person purchases a book, music, or a movie he or she is given the option of sending emails recommending the item to friends.",
                "The first person to purchase the same item through a referral link in the email gets a 10% discount.",
                "When this happens the sender of the recommendation receives a 10% credit on their purchase.",
                "The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users.",
                "The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003.",
                "In total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos.",
                "In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailers website to obtain product categories, reviews and ratings for all products.",
                "Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).",
                "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
                "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor.",
                "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product.",
                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
                "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
                "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
                "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
                "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 Recommendation network statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the product and product price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount.",
                "The sender and receiver IDs were shadowed.",
                "We represent this data set as a directed multi graph.",
                "The nodes represent customers, and a directed edge contains all the information about the recommendation.",
                "The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended product p to customer j at time t. The typical process generating edges in the recommendation network is as follows: a node i first buys a product p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn.",
                "The j nodes can they buy the product and further recommend it.",
                "The only way for a node to recommend a product is to first buy it.",
                "Note that even if all nodes j buy a product, only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase (within a week after the recommendation) will be marked by a buy-bit.",
                "Because the buy-bit is set only for the first person who acts on a recommendation, we identify additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations must be preceded by a purchase.",
                "We call this type of evidence of purchase a buyedge.",
                "Note that buy-edges provide only a lower bound on the total number of purchases without discounts.",
                "It is possible for a customer to not be the first to act on a recommendation and also to not recommend the product to others.",
                "Unfortunately, this was not recorded in the data set.",
                "We consider, however, the buy-bits and buy-edges as proxies for the total number of purchases through recommendations.",
                "For each product group we took recommendations on all products from the group and created a network.",

                "The column eu shows the number of unique edges - disregarding multiple recommendations between the same source and recipient.",
                "In terms of the number of different items, there are by far the most music CDs, followed by books and videos.",
                "There is a surprisingly small number of DVD titles.",
                "On the other hand, DVDs account for more half of all recommendations in the dataset.",
                "The DVD network is also the most dense, having about 10 recommendations per node, while books and music have about 2 recommendations per node and videos have only a bit more than 1 recommendation per node.",
                "Music recommendations reached about the same number of people as DVDs but used more than 5 times fewer recommendations to achieve the same coverage of the nodes.",
                "Book recommendations reached by far the most people - 2.8 million.",
                "Notice that all networks have a very small number of unique edges.",
                "For books, videos and music the number of unique edges is smaller than the number of nodes - this suggests that the networks are highly disconnected [5].",
                "Figure 1(a) shows the fraction of nodes in largest weakly connected component over time.",
                "Notice the component is very small.",
                "Even if we compose a network using all the recommendations in the dataset, the largest connected component contains less than 2.5% (100,420) of the nodes, and the second largest component has only 600 nodes.",
                "Still, some smaller communities, numbering in the tens of thousands of purchasers of DVDs in categories such as westerns, classics and Japanese animated films (anime), had connected components spanning about 20% of their members.",
                "The insert in figure 1(a) shows the growth of the customer base over time.",
                "Surprisingly it was linear, adding on average 165,000 new users each month, which is an indication that the service itself was not spreading epidemically.",
                "Further evidence of non-viral spread is provided by the relatively high percentage (94%) of users who made their first recommendation without having previously received one.",
                "Back to table 1: given the total number of recommendations e and purchases (bb + be) influenced by recommendations we can estimate how many recommendations need to be independently sent over the network to induce a new purchase.",
                "Using this metric books have the most influential recommendations followed by DVDs and music.",
                "For books one out of 69 recommendations resulted in a purchase.",
                "For DVDs it increases to 108 recommendations per purchase and further increases to 136 for music and 203 for video.",
                "Even with these simple counts we can make the first few observations.",
                "It seems that some people got quite heavily involved in the recommendation program, and that they tended to recommend a large number of products to the same set of friends (since the number of unique edges is so small).",
                "This shows that people tend to buy more DVDs and also like to recommend them to their friends, while they seem to be more conservative with books.",
                "One possible reason is that a book is bigger time investment than a DVD: one usually needs several days to read a book, while a DVD can be viewed in a single evening.",
                "One external factor which may be affecting the recommendation patterns for DVDs is the existence of referral websites (www.dvdtalk.com).",
                "On these websites people, who want to buy a DVD and get a discount, would ask for recommendations.",
                "This way there would be recommendations made between people who dont really know each other but rather have an economic incentive to cooperate.",
                "We were not able to find similar referral sharing sites for books or CDs. 2.3 Forward recommendations Not all people who make a purchase also decide to give recommendations.",
                "So we estimate what fraction of people that purchase also decide to recommend forward.",
                "To obtain this information we can only use the nodes with purchases that resulted in a discount.",
                "The last 3 columns of table 1 show that only about a third of the people that purchase also recommend the product forward.",
                "The ratio of forward recommendations is much higher for DVDs than for other kinds of products.",
                "Videos also have a higher ratio of forward recommendations, while books have the lowest.",
                "This shows that people are most keen on recommending movies, while more conservative when recommending books and music.",
                "Figure 1(b) shows the cumulative out-degree distribution, that is the number of people who sent out at least kp recommendations, for a product.",
                "It shows that the deeper an individual is in the cascade, if they choose to make recommendations, they tend to recommend to a greater number of people on average (the distribution has a higher variance).",
                "This effect is probably due to only very heavily recommended products producing large enough cascades to reach a certain depth.",
                "We also observe that the probability of an individual making a recommendation at all (which can only occur if they make a purchase), declines after an initial increase as one gets deeper into the cascade. 2.4 Identifying cascades As customers continue forwarding recommendations, they contribute to the formation of cascades.",
                "In order to identify cascades, i.e. the causal propagation of recommendations, we track successful recommendations as they influence purchases and further recommendations.",
                "We define a recommendation to be successful if it reached a node before its first purchase.",

                "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Although the retailer may have hoped to boost its revenues through viral marketing, the additional purchases that resulted from recommendations are just a drop in the bucket of sales that occur through the website.",
                "Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.",
                "Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.",
                "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly <br>connected individual</br>s play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",
                "So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread. 8.",

                "Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]).",
                "But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.",
                "We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised viral marketing program.",
                "The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.",
                "Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor influencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for advertisers to tap into.",
                "Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication.",
                "Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.",
                "Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7].",
                "Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.",
                "Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.",
                "At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.",
                "Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a fat tail phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items.",

                "Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the consumer, who would benefit from learning about new products.",
                "The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.",
                "Quantitative marketing techniques have been proposed [12], and the rating of products and merchants has been shown to effect the likelihood of an item being bought [13, 4].",
                "Of further help to the consumer are collaborative filtering recommendations of the form people who bought x also bought y feature [11].",
                "These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.",
                "It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.",

                "In contrast, in our study we are able to directly observe the effectiveness of person to person word of mouth advertising for hundreds of thousands of products for the first time.",
                "We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial purchase of a product.",

                "Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.",
                "We also propose models to identify products for which viral marketing is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often.",

                "Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).",
                "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
                "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor.",
                "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product.",
                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
                "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
                "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
                "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
                "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product.",

                "We present the histograms of the thinking time, i.e. the difference between the time of purchase and the time the last recommendation was received for the product prior to the purchase (figure 8).",
                "We use a bin size of 1 day.",
                "Around 35%40% of book and DVD purchases occurred within a day after the last recommendation was received.",
                "For DVDs 16% purchases occur more than a week after last recommendation, while this drops to 10% for books.",
                "In contrast, if we consider the lag between the purchase and the first recommendation, only 23% of DVD purchases are made within a day, while the proportion stays the same for books.",
                "This reflects a greater likelihood for a person to receive multiple recommendations for a DVD than for a book.",
                "At the same time, DVD recommenders tend to send out many more recommendations, only one of which can result in a discount.",
                "Individuals then often miss their chance of a discount, which is reflected in the high ratio (78%) of recommended DVD purchases that did not a get discount (see table 1, columns bb and be).",
                "In contrast, for books, only 21% of purchases through recommendations did not receive a discount.",
                "We also measure the variation in intensity by time of day for three different activities in the recommendation system: recommendations (figure 9(a)), all purchases (figure 9(b)), and finally just the purchases which resulted in a discount (figure 9(c)).",
                "Each is given as a total count by hour of day.",
                "The recommendations and purchases follow the same pattern.",
                "The only small difference is that purchases reach a sharper peak in the afternoon (after 3pm Pacific Time, 6pm Eastern time).",
                "The purchases that resulted in a discount look like a negative image of the first two figures.",
                "This means that most of discounted purchases happened in the morning when the traffic (number of purchases/recommendations) on the retailers website was low.",
                "This makes a lot of sense since most of the recommendations happened during the day, and if the person wanted to get the discount by being the first one to purchase, she had the highest chances when the traffic on the website was the lowest. 5.",
                "RECOMMENDATION EFFECTIVENESS BY BOOK CATEGORY Social networks are a product of the contexts that bring people together.",

                "For example, in small world experiments, where participants attempt to reach a target individual through their chain of acquaintances, profession trumped geography, which in turn was more useful in locating a target than attributes such as religion or hobbies [9, 17].",

                "For clarity, we group the results by 4 different category types: fiction, personal/leisure, professional/technical, and nonfiction/other.",
                "Fiction encompasses categories such as Sci-Fi and Romance, as well as childrens and young adult books.",
                "Personal/Leisure encompasses everything from gardening, photography and cooking to health and religion.",
                "First, we compare the relative number of recommendations to reviews posted on the site (column cav/rp1 of table 2).",
                "Surprisingly, we find that the number of people making personal recommendations was only a few times greater than the number of people posting a public review on the website.",
                "We observe that fiction books have relatively few recommendations compared to the number of reviews, while professional and technical books have more recommendations than reviews.",
                "This could reflect several factors.",
                "One is that people feel more confident reviewing fiction than technical books.",
                "Another is that they hesitate to recommend a work of fiction before reading it themselves, since the recommendation must be made at the point of purchase.",
                "Yet another explanation is that the median price of a work of fiction is lower than that of a technical book.",
                "This means that the discount received for successfully recommending a mystery novel or thriller is lower and hence people have less incentive to send recommendations.",
                "Next, we measure the per category efficacy of recommendations by observing the ratio of the number of purchases occurring within a week following a recommendation to the number of recommenders for each book subject category (column b of table 2).",
                "On average, only 2% of the recommenders of a book received a discount because their recommendation was accepted, and another 1% made a recommendation that resulted in a purchase, but not a discount.",
                "We observe marked differences in the response to recommendation for different categories of books.",
                "Fiction in general is not very effectively recommended, with only around 2% of recommenders succeeding.",
                "The efficacy was a bit higher (around 3%) for non-fiction books dealing with personal and leisure pursuits, but is significantly higher in the professional and technical category.",
                "Medical books have nearly double the average rate of recommendation acceptance.",
                "This could be in part attributed to the higher median price of medical books and technical books in general.",
                "As we will see in Section 6, a higher product price increases the chance that a recommendation will be accepted.",
                "Recommendations are also more likely to be accepted for certain religious categories: 4.3% for Christian living and theology and 4.8% for Bibles.",
                "In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower recommendation effectiveness.",
                "These results raise the interesting possibility that individuals have greater influence over one another in an organized context, for example through a professional contact or a religious one.",
                "There are exceptions of course.",
                "For example, Japanese anime DVDs have a strong following in the US, and this is reflected in their frequency and success in recommendations.",
                "Another example is that of gardening.",
                "In general, recommendations for books relating to gardening have only a modest chance of being accepted, which agrees with the individual prerogative that accompanies this hobby.",
                "At the same time, orchid cultivation can be a highly organized and social activity, with frequent shows and online communities devoted entirely to orchids.",
                "Perhaps because of this, the rate of acceptance of orchid book recommendations is twice as high as those for books on vegetable or tomato growing. 6.",

                "Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.",
                "Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.",
                "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",
                "So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread. 8.",

                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",

                "As we move to higher numbers of incoming recommendations, the number of observations drops rapidly.",
                "For example, there were 5 million cases with 1 incoming recommendation on a book, and only 58 cases where a person got 20 incoming recommendations on a particular book.",
                "The maximum was 30 incoming recommendations.",
                "For these reasons we cut-off the plot when the number of observations becomes too small and the error bars too large.",
                "Figure 5(a) shows that, overall, book recommendations are rarely followed.",
                "Even more surprisingly, as more and more recommendations are received, their success decreases.",
                "We observe a peak in probability of buying at 2 incoming recommendations and then a slow drop.",
                "For DVDs (figure 5(b)) we observe a saturation around 10 incoming recommendations.",
                "This means that after a person gets 10 recommendations on a particular DVD, they become immune to them - their probability of buying does not increase anymore.",

                "For the experiment we consider only node pairs (u, v), where there were at least a total of 10 recommendations sent from u to v. We perform the experiment using only recommendations from the same product group.",
                "Figure 6 shows the probability of buying as a function of the total number of exchanged recommendations between two persons up to that point.",
                "For books we observe that the effectiveness of recommendation remains about constant up to 3 exchanged recommendations.",
                "As the number of exchanged recommendations increases, the probability of buying starts to decrease to about half of the original value and then levels off.",
                "For DVDs we observe an immediate and consistent drop.",
                "This experiment shows that recommendations start to lose effect after more than two or three are passed between two people.",
                "We performed the experiment also for video and music, but the number of observations was too low and the measurements were noisy. 3.3 Success of outgoing recommendations In previous sections we examined the data from the viewpoint of the receiver of the recommendation.",
                "Now we look from the viewpoint of the sender.",
                "The two interesting questions are: how does the probability of getting a 10% credit change with the number of outgoing recommendations; and given a number of outgoing recommendations, how many purchases will they influence?",
                "One would expect that recommendations would be the most effective when recommended to the right subset of friends.",
                "If one is very selective and recommends to too few friends, then the chances of success are slim.",
                "One the other hand, recommending to everyone and spamming them with recommendations may have limited returns as well.",
                "The top row of figure 7 shows how the average number of purchases changes with the number of outgoing recommendations.",
                "For books, music, and videos the number of purchases soon saturates: it grows fast up to around 10 outgoing recommendations and then the trend either slows or starts to drop.",
                "DVDs exhibit different behavior, with the expected number of purchases increasing throughout.",
                "But if we plot the probability of getting a 10% credit as a function of the number of outgoing recommendations, as in the bottom row of figure 7, we see that the success of DVD recommendations saturates as well, while books, videos and music have qualitatively similar trends.",
                "The difference in the curves for DVD recommendations points to the presence of collisions in the dense DVD network, which has 10 recommendations per node and around 400 per product - an order of magnitude more than other product groups.",

                "In contrast, if we consider the lag between the purchase and the first recommendation, only 23% of DVD purchases are made within a day, while the proportion stays the same for books.",
                "This reflects a greater likelihood for a person to receive multiple recommendations for a DVD than for a book.",
                "At the same time, DVD recommenders tend to send out many more recommendations, only one of which can result in a discount.",
                "Individuals then often miss their chance of a discount, which is reflected in the high ratio (78%) of recommended DVD purchases that did not a get discount (see table 1, columns bb and be).",
                "In contrast, for books, only 21% of purchases through recommendations did not receive a discount.",
                "We also measure the variation in intensity by time of day for three different activities in the recommendation system: recommendations (figure 9(a)), all purchases (figure 9(b)), and finally just the purchases which resulted in a discount (figure 9(c)).",
                "Each is given as a total count by hour of day.",
                "The recommendations and purchases follow the same pattern.",
                "The only small difference is that purchases reach a sharper peak in the afternoon (after 3pm Pacific Time, 6pm Eastern time).",
                "The purchases that resulted in a discount look like a negative image of the first two figures.",
                "This means that most of discounted purchases happened in the morning when the traffic (number of purchases/recommendations) on the retailers website was low.",
                "This makes a lot of sense since most of the recommendations happened during the day, and if the person wanted to get the discount by being the first one to purchase, she had the highest chances when the traffic on the website was the lowest. 5.",

                "We observe that fiction books have relatively few recommendations compared to the number of reviews, while professional and technical books have more recommendations than reviews.",
                "This could reflect several factors.",
                "One is that people feel more confident reviewing fiction than technical books.",
                "Another is that they hesitate to recommend a work of fiction before reading it themselves, since the recommendation must be made at the point of purchase.",
                "Yet another explanation is that the median price of a work of fiction is lower than that of a technical book.",
                "This means that the discount received for successfully recommending a mystery novel or thriller is lower and hence people have less incentive to send recommendations.",
                "Next, we measure the per category efficacy of recommendations by observing the ratio of the number of purchases occurring within a week following a recommendation to the number of recommenders for each book subject category (column b of table 2).",

                "Recommendations are also more likely to be accepted for certain religious categories: 4.3% for Christian living and theology and 4.8% for Bibles.",
                "In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower recommendation effectiveness.",

                "Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.",
                "Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.",
                "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",

                "Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]).",
                "But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.",
                "We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised viral marketing program.",
                "The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.",
                "Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor influencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for advertisers to tap into.",
                "Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for viral marketing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication.",
                "Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.",
                "Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7].",
                "Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.",
                "Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.",
                "At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.",
                "Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a fat tail phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items.",

                "Effectively advertising these niche products using traditional advertising approaches is impractical.",
                "Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the consumer, who would benefit from learning about new products.",
                "The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.",

                "These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.",
                "It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.",

                "We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial purchase of a product.",

                "For example, individuals likelihood of purchasing a product initially increases as they receive additional recommendations for it, but a saturation point is quickly reached.",
                "Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.",
                "We also propose models to identify products for which viral marketing is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often.",
                "We also observe patterns in the timing of recommendations and purchases corresponding to times of day when people are likely to be shopping online or reading email.",
                "We report on these and other findings in the following sections. 2.",
                "THE RECOMMENDATION NETWORK 2.1 Dataset description Our analysis focuses on the recommendation referral program run by a large retailer.",
                "The program rules were as follows.",
                "Each time a person purchases a book, music, or a movie he or she is given the option of sending emails recommending the item to friends.",
                "The first person to purchase the same item through a referral link in the email gets a 10% discount.",
                "When this happens the sender of the recommendation receives a 10% credit on their purchase.",
                "The recommendation dataset consists of 15,646,121 recommendations made among 3,943,084 distinct users.",
                "The data was collected from June 5 2001 to May 16 2003.",
                "In total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos.",
                "In addition to recommendation data, we also crawled the retailers website to obtain product categories, reviews and ratings for all products.",
                "Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).",
                "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
                "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor.",
                "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product.",
                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
                "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
                "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
                "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
                "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 Recommendation network statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the product and product price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount.",
                "The sender and receiver IDs were shadowed.",
                "We represent this data set as a directed multi graph.",
                "The nodes represent customers, and a directed edge contains all the information about the recommendation.",
                "The edge (i, j, p, t) indicates that i recommended product p to customer j at time t. The typical process generating edges in the recommendation network is as follows: a node i first buys a product p at time t and then it recommends it to nodes j1, . . . , jn.",
                "The j nodes can they buy the product and further recommend it.",
                "The only way for a node to recommend a product is to first buy it.",
                "Note that even if all nodes j buy a product, only the edge to the node jk that first made the purchase (within a week after the recommendation) will be marked by a buy-bit.",
                "Because the buy-bit is set only for the first person who acts on a recommendation, we identify additional purchases by the presence of outgoing recommendations for a person, since all recommendations must be preceded by a purchase.",
                "We call this type of evidence of purchase a buyedge.",
                "Note that buy-edges provide only a lower bound on the total number of purchases without discounts.",
                "It is possible for a customer to not be the first to act on a recommendation and also to not recommend the product to others.",
                "Unfortunately, this was not recorded in the data set.",
                "We consider, however, the buy-bits and buy-edges as proxies for the total number of purchases through recommendations.",
                "For each product group we took recommendations on all products from the group and created a network.",

                "The column eu shows the number of unique edges - disregarding multiple recommendations between the same source and recipient.",
                "In terms of the number of different items, there are by far the most music CDs, followed by books and videos.",
                "There is a surprisingly small number of DVD titles.",
                "On the other hand, DVDs account for more half of all recommendations in the dataset.",
                "The DVD network is also the most dense, having about 10 recommendations per node, while books and music have about 2 recommendations per node and videos have only a bit more than 1 recommendation per node.",
                "Music recommendations reached about the same number of people as DVDs but used more than 5 times fewer recommendations to achieve the same coverage of the nodes.",
                "Book recommendations reached by far the most people - 2.8 million.",
                "Notice that all networks have a very small number of unique edges.",
                "For books, videos and music the number of unique edges is smaller than the number of nodes - this suggests that the networks are highly disconnected [5].",
                "Figure 1(a) shows the fraction of nodes in largest weakly connected component over time.",
                "Notice the component is very small.",
                "Even if we compose a network using all the recommendations in the dataset, the largest connected component contains less than 2.5% (100,420) of the nodes, and the second largest component has only 600 nodes.",
                "Still, some smaller communities, numbering in the tens of thousands of purchasers of DVDs in categories such as westerns, classics and Japanese animated films (anime), had connected components spanning about 20% of their members.",
                "The insert in figure 1(a) shows the growth of the customer base over time.",
                "Surprisingly it was linear, adding on average 165,000 new users each month, which is an indication that the service itself was not spreading epidemically.",
                "Further evidence of non-viral spread is provided by the relatively high percentage (94%) of users who made their first recommendation without having previously received one.",
                "Back to table 1: given the total number of recommendations e and purchases (bb + be) influenced by recommendations we can estimate how many recommendations need to be independently sent over the network to induce a new purchase.",
                "Using this metric books have the most influential recommendations followed by DVDs and music.",
                "For books one out of 69 recommendations resulted in a purchase.",
                "For DVDs it increases to 108 recommendations per purchase and further increases to 136 for music and 203 for video.",
                "Even with these simple counts we can make the first few observations.",
                "It seems that some people got quite heavily involved in the recommendation program, and that they tended to recommend a large number of products to the same set of friends (since the number of unique edges is so small).",
                "This shows that people tend to buy more DVDs and also like to recommend them to their friends, while they seem to be more conservative with books.",
                "One possible reason is that a book is bigger time investment than a DVD: one usually needs several days to read a book, while a DVD can be viewed in a single evening.",
                "One external factor which may be affecting the recommendation patterns for DVDs is the existence of referral websites (www.dvdtalk.com).",
                "On these websites people, who want to buy a DVD and get a discount, would ask for recommendations.",
                "This way there would be recommendations made between people who dont really know each other but rather have an economic incentive to cooperate.",
                "We were not able to find similar referral sharing sites for books or CDs. 2.3 Forward recommendations Not all people who make a purchase also decide to give recommendations.",
                "So we estimate what fraction of people that purchase also decide to recommend forward.",
                "To obtain this information we can only use the nodes with purchases that resulted in a discount.",
                "The last 3 columns of table 1 show that only about a third of the people that purchase also recommend the product forward.",
                "The ratio of forward recommendations is much higher for DVDs than for other kinds of products.",
                "Videos also have a higher ratio of forward recommendations, while books have the lowest.",
                "This shows that people are most keen on recommending movies, while more conservative when recommending books and music.",
                "Figure 1(b) shows the cumulative out-degree distribution, that is the number of people who sent out at least kp recommendations, for a product.",
                "It shows that the deeper an individual is in the cascade, if they choose to make recommendations, they tend to recommend to a greater number of people on average (the distribution has a higher variance).",
                "This effect is probably due to only very heavily recommended products producing large enough cascades to reach a certain depth.",
                "We also observe that the probability of an individual making a recommendation at all (which can only occur if they make a purchase), declines after an initial increase as one gets deeper into the cascade. 2.4 Identifying cascades As customers continue forwarding recommendations, they contribute to the formation of cascades.",

                "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Although the retailer may have hoped to boost its revenues through viral marketing, the additional purchases that resulted from recommendations are just a drop in the bucket of sales that occur through the website.",
                "Nevertheless, we were able to obtain a number of interesting insights into how viral marketing works that challenge common assumptions made in epidemic and rumor propagation modeling.",
                "Firstly, it is frequently assumed in epidemic models that individuals have equal probability of being infected every time they interact.",
                "Contrary to this we observe that the probability of infection decreases with repeated interaction.",
                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to viral marketing.",
                "So despite the relative ineffectiveness of the viral marketing program in general, we found a number of new insights which we hope will have general applicability to marketing strategies and to future models of viral information spread. 8.",

                "Previously, a few in depth studies have shown that social networks affect the adoption of individual innovations and products (for a review see [15] or [16]).",
                "But until recently it has been difficult to measure how influential person-to-person recommendations actually are over a wide range of products.",
                "We were able to directly measure and model the effectiveness of recommendations by studying one online retailers incentivised <br>viral market</br>ing program.",
                "The website gave discounts to customers recommending any of its products to others, and then tracked the resulting purchases and additional recommendations.",
                "Although word of mouth can be a powerful factor influencing purchasing decisions, it can be tricky for advertisers to tap into.",
                "Some services used by individuals to communicate are natural candidates for <br>viral market</br>ing, because the product can be observed or advertised as part of the communication.",
                "Email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo had very fast adoption curves because every email sent through them contained an advertisement for the service and because they were free.",
                "Hotmail spent a mere $50,000 on traditional marketing and still grew from zero to 12 million users in 18 months [7].",
                "Googles Gmail captured a significant part of market share in spite of the fact that the only way to sign up for the service was through a referral.",
                "Most products cannot be advertised in such a direct way.",
                "At the same time the choice of products available to consumers has increased manyfold thanks to online retailers who can supply a much wider variety of products than traditional brick-and-mortar stores.",
                "Not only is the variety of products larger, but one observes a fat tail phenomenon, where a large fraction of purchases are of relatively obscure items.",

                "Therefore using more targeted marketing approaches is advantageous both to the merchant and the consumer, who would benefit from learning about new products.",
                "The problem is partly addressed by the advent of online product and merchant reviews, both at retail sites such as EBay and Amazon, and specialized product comparison sites such as Epinions and CNET.",
                "Quantitative marketing techniques have been proposed [12], and the rating of products and merchants has been shown to effect the likelihood of an item being bought [13, 4].",
                "Of further help to the consumer are collaborative filtering recommendations of the form people who bought x also bought y feature [11].",
                "These refinements help consumers discover new products 228 and receive more accurate evaluations, but they cannot completely substitute personalized recommendations that one receives from a friend or relative.",
                "It is human nature to be more interested in what a friend buys than what an anonymous person buys, to be more likely to trust their opinion, and to be more influenced by their actions.",

                "In contrast, in our study we are able to directly observe the effectiveness of person to person word of mouth advertising for hundreds of thousands of products for the first time.",
                "We find that most recommendation chains do not grow very large, often terminating with the initial purchase of a product.",
                "However, occasionally a product will propagate through a very active recommendation network.",
                "We propose a simple stochastic model that seems to explain the propagation of recommendations.",

                "For example, individuals likelihood of purchasing a product initially increases as they receive additional recommendations for it, but a saturation point is quickly reached.",
                "Interestingly, as more recommendations are sent between the same two individuals, the likelihood that they will be heeded decreases.",
                "We also propose models to identify products for which <br>viral market</br>ing is effective: We find that the category and price of product plays a role, with recommendations of expensive products of interest to small, well connected communities resulting in a purchase more often.",

                "In total, 548,523 products were recommended, 99% of them belonging to 4 main product groups: Books, DVDs, Music and Videos.",

                "Of the products in our data set, 5813 (1%) were discontinued (the retailer no longer provided any information about them).",
                "Although the data gives us a detailed and accurate view of recommendation dynamics, it does have its limitations.",
                "The only indication of the success of a recommendation is the observation of the recipient purchasing the product through the same vendor.",
                "We have no way of knowing if the person had decided instead to purchase elsewhere, borrow, or otherwise obtain the product.",
                "The delivery of the recommendation is also somewhat different from one person simply telling another about a product they enjoy, possibly in the context of a broader discussion of similar products.",
                "The recommendation is received as a form email including information about the discount program.",
                "Someone reading the email might consider it spam, or at least deem it less important than a recommendation given in the context of a conversation.",
                "The recipient may also doubt whether the friend is recommending the product because they think the recipient might enjoy it, or are simply trying to get a discount for themselves.",
                "Finally, because the recommendation takes place before the recommender receives the product, it might not be based on a direct observation of the product.",
                "Nevertheless, we believe that these recommendation networks are reflective of the nature of word of mouth advertising, and give us key insights into the influence of social networks on purchasing decisions. 2.2 Recommendation network statistics For each recommendation, the dataset included the product and product price, sender ID, receiver ID, the sent date, and a buy-bit, indicating whether the recommendation resulted in a purchase and discount.",

                "Yet another explanation is that the median price of a work of fiction is lower than that of a technical book.",

                "Recommendations are also more likely to be accepted for certain religious categories: 4.3% for Christian living and theology and 4.8% for Bibles.",
                "In contrast, books not tied to organized religions, such as ones on the subject of new age (2.5%) and occult (2.2%) spirituality, have lower recommendation effectiveness.",

                "In general, recommendations for books relating to gardening have only a modest chance of being accepted, which agrees with the individual prerogative that accompanies this hobby.",
                "At the same time, orchid cultivation can be a highly organized and social activity, with frequent shows and online communities devoted entirely to orchids.",

                "Marketers should take heed that providing excessive incentives for customers to recommend products could backfire by weakening the credibility of the very same links they are trying to take advantage of.",
                "Traditional epidemic and innovation diffusion models also often assume that individuals either have a constant probability of converting every time they interact with an infected individual or that they convert once the fraction of their contacts who are infected exceeds a threshold.",
                "In both cases, an increasing number of infected contacts results in an increased likelihood of infection.",
                "Instead, we find that the probability of purchasing a product increases with the number of recommendations received, but quickly saturates to a constant and relatively low probability.",
                "This means individuals are often impervious to the recommendations of their friends, and resist buying items that they do not want.",
                "In network-based epidemic models, extremely highly connected individuals play a very important role.",
                "For example, in needle sharing and sexual contact networks these nodes become the super-spreaders by infecting a large number of people.",
                "But these models assume that a high degree node has as much of a probability of infecting each of its neighbors as a low degree node does.",
                "In contrast, we find that there are limits to how influential high degree nodes are in the recommendation network.",
                "As a person sends out more and more recommendations past a certain number for a product, the success per recommendation declines.",
                "This would seem to indicate that individuals have influence over a few of their friends, but not everybody they know.",
                "We also presented a simple stochastic model that allows for the presence of relatively large cascades for a few products, but reflects well the general tendency of recommendation chains to terminate after just a short number of steps.",
                "We saw that the characteristics of product reviews and effectiveness of recommendations vary by category and price, with more successful recommendations being made on technical or religious books, which presumably are placed in the social context of a school, workplace or place of worship.",
                "Finally, we presented a model which shows that smaller and more tightly knit groups tend to be more conducive to <br>viral market</br>ing.",
