Wellman University of Michigan AI Laboratory 1101 Beal Avenue Ann Arbor, MI 48109 ABSTRACT We develop a framework for trading in compound securities: financial instruments that pay off contingent on the outcomes of arbitrary statements in propositional logic. Buying or selling securities-which can be thought of as betting on or against a particular future outcome-allows agents both to hedge risk and to profit (in expectation) on subjective predictions. A compound securities market allows agents to place bets on arbitrary boolean combinations of events, enabling them to more closely achieve their optimal risk exposure, and enabling the market as a whole to more closely achieve the social optimum. The tradeoff for allowing such expressivity is in the complexity of the agents and auctioneers optimization problems. We develop and motivate the concept of a compound securities market, presenting the framework through a series of formal definitions and examples. We then analyze in detail the auctioneers matching problem. We show that, with n events, the matching problem is co-NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case. We show that the latter hardness result holds even under severe language restrictions on bids. With log n events, the problem is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case. We briefly discuss matching algorithms and tractable special cases.

INTRODUCTION Securities markets effectively allow traders to place bets on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions. Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like CBOE [17], futures markets like CME [30], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [11, 12], sports betting markets [7, 13, 32], horse racing markets [33], idea futures markets [16], decision markets [14] and even market games [4, 24, 25]. The economic value of securities markets is two-fold. First, they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes. For example, the owner of a stock might buy a put option (the right to sell the stock at a particular price) in order to insure against a stock downturn. Or the owner of a house may purchase an insurance contract to hedge against unforeseen damage to the house. Second, securities markets allow traders to speculate, or to obtain a subjective expected profit when market prices do not reflect their assessment of the likelihood of future outcomes. For example, a trader might buy a call option if he believes that the likelihood is high that the price of the underlying stock will go up, regardless of risk exposure to changes in the stock price. Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28]. Real securities markets have complex payoff structures with various triggers. However, these can all be modeled as collections of more basic or atomic Arrow-Debreu securities [1, 8, 20]. One unit of one Arrow-Debreu security pays off one dollar if and only if (iff) a corresponding binary event occurs; it pays nothing if the event does not occur. So, for example, one unit of a security denoted Acme100 might pay $1 iff Acmes stock is above $100 on January 4, 2004. An Acme stock option as it would be defined on a finan144 cial exchange can be though of as a portfolio of such atomic securities.1 In this paper, we develop and analyze a framework for trading in compound securities markets with payoffs contingent on arbitrary logical combinations of events, including conditionals. For example, given binary events A, B, and C, one trader might bid to buy three units of a security denoted A ∧ ¯B ∨ C that pays off $1 iff the compound event A ∧ ¯B ∨ C occurs for thirty cents each. Another trader may bid to sell six units of a security A|C that pays off $1 iff A occurs for fifty-five cents each, conditional on event C occurring, meaning that the transaction is revoked if C does not occur (i.e., no payoff is given and the price of the security is refunded) [5]. Bids may also be divisible, meaning that bidders are willing to accept less than the requested quantity, or indivisible, meaning that bids must be fulfilled either completely or not at all. Given a set of such bids, the auctioneer faces a complex matching problem to decide which bids are accepted for how many units at what price. Typically, the auctioneer seeks to take on no risk of its own, only matching up agreeable trades among the bidders, but we also consider alternative formulations where the auctioneer acts as a market maker willing to accept some risk. We examine the computational complexity of the auctioneers matching problem. Let the length of the description of all the available securities be O(n). With n events, the matching problem is co-NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case. This Σp 2-complete hardness holds even when the bidding language is significantly restricted. With log n events, the problem is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case. Section 2 presents some necessary background information, motivation, and related work. Section 3 formally describes our framework for compound securities, and defines the auctioneers matching problem. Section 4 briefly discusses natural algorithms for solving the matching problem. Section 5 proves our central computational complexity results. Section 6 discusses the possibility of tractable special cases. Section 7 concludes with a summary and some ideas of future directions. 2. PRELIMINARIES 2.1 Background and notation Imagine a world where there are only two future uncertain events of any consequence: (1) the event that ones house is struck by lightning by December 31, 2003, denoted struck, and (2) the event that Acmes stock price goes above $100 by January 4, 2004, denoted acme100. In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100. Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states. For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is. Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not. Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk. For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state. In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18]. All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω. Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily. So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events. Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes. Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events. Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon). Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires. Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally. If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20]. In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable. No truly complete market exists or will ever exist. One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible. Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids. The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1]. The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation. In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization. Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete. For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options. Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness. Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities. The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23]. They show that, if all agents risk-neutral independencies agree with the independencies encoded in the market structure, then the market is operationally complete. For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient. Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities. If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders. The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation. Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading. CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events. For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B . Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures. Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods. In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions. Compound securities differ from combinatorial auctions in concept and complexity. Compound securities allow bidders to construct an arbitrary bet on any of the 22n possible compound events expressible as logical functions of the n base events, conditional on any other of the 22n compound events. Agents optimize based on their own subjective probabilities and risk attitude (and in general, their beliefs about other agents beliefs and utilities, ad infinitum). The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk. Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods. Typically, 3 Specifically, one unit of each pays off $2 iff both A and B occur, $1 iff A or B occurs (but not both), and $0 otherwise. uncertainty-and thus risk-is not considered. The central auctioneer problem is to maximize social welfare. Also note that the problems lie in different complexity classes. While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case. In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2). There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size. Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods. The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk. Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods. Hanson [15] develops a market mechanism called a market scoring rule that is especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes. The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation. At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution. In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution. In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate. Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments. The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded. Though Hanson offers some initial suggestions, several open problems remain, including efficient methods for representing and updating the joint distribution and recording traders positions and portfolios, without resorting to exponential time and space algorithms. Fagin, Halpern, and Megiddo [9] give a sound and complete axiomatization for deciding whether sets of probabilistic inequalities are consistent. Bids for compound securities can be thought of as expressions of probabilistic inequalities: for example, a bid to buy A ∧ B at price 0.3 is a statement that the probability of A ∧ B is greater than 0.3. If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match. However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes. We address these issues below. 146 3. FRAMEWORK FOR TRADING IN COMPOUND SECURITIES 3.1 High-level description Common knowledge among agents is the set of events A. There are no predefined securities. Instead, agents offer to buy or sell securities of their own design that pay off contingent on logical combinations of events and event negations. Combination operators may include conjunctions, disjunctions, and conditionals. For all practical purposes, it is impossible for agents to trade in enough securities (2n ) to form a complete market, so agents must devise their best tradeoff between the number and complexity of their bids, and the extent to which their risks are hedged and desirable bets are placed. In its most general form, the problem is game-theoretic in nature, since what an agent should offer depends on what it believes other agents will accept. At the other end of the spectrum, a simplified version of the problem is to optimize bids only on currently available securities at current prices. In between these two formulations are other possible interesting optimization problems. Approximation algorithms might also be pursued. The auctioneer faces a nontrivial problem of matching buy and sell orders to maximize surplus (the cash and securities left over after accepted bids are fulfilled). For example, offers to sell A1A2 at $0.2 and A1 ¯A2 at $0.1 can match with an offer to buy A1 at $0.4, with surplus $0.1. Or an offer to sell A1 at $0.3 can match with an offer to buy A1A2 at $0.4, with surplus $0.1 in cash and A1 ¯A2 in securities. In general, a single security might qualify for multiple matches, but only one can be transacted. So the auctioneer must find the optimal set of matches that maximizes surplus, which could be measured in a number of ways. Again, approximation algorithms might be considered. In another formulation, the auctioneer functions as a market maker willing to take on a certain amount of risk. Informally, our motivation is to provide a mechanism that allows a very high degree of expressivity in placing hedges and bets, and is also capable of approximating the optimal (complete-market) allocation of risk, trading off the number and complexity of securities and transactions needed. 3.2 Formal description 3.2.1 Securities We use φ and ψ to denote arbitrary boolean formulas, or logical combinations of events in A. We denote securities φ|ψ . Securities pay off $1 if and only if (iff) φ and ψ are true, pay off $0 iff φ is false and ψ is true, and are canceled (i.e., any price paid is refunded) iff ψ is false. We define T ≡ Ω to be the event true and F ≡ ∅ to be the event false. We abbreviate φ|T as φ . 3.2.2 Orders Agents place orders, denoted o, of the form q units of φ|ψ at price p per unit, where q > 0 implies a buy order and q < 0 implies a sell order. We assume agents submitting buy (sell) orders will accept any price p∗ ≤ p (p∗ ≥ p). We distinguish between divisible and indivisible orders. Agents submitting divisible orders will accept any quantity αq where 0 < α ≤ 1. Agents submitting indivisible orders will accept only exactly q units, or none at all. We believe that, given the nature of what is being traded (state-contingent dollars), most agents will be content to trade using divisible orders. Every order o can be translated into a payoff vector Υ across all states ω ∈ Ω. The payoff Υ ω in state ω is q · 1ω∈ψ(1ω∈φ − p), where 1ω∈E equals 1 iff ω ∈ E and zero otherwise. Recall that the 2n states correspond to the 2n possible combinations of event outcomes. We index multiple orders with subscripts (e.g., oi and Υi). Let the set of all orders be O and the set of all corresponding payoff vectors be P. Example 1. (Translating orders into payoff vectors) Suppose that |A| = 3. Consider an order to buy two units of A2 ∨ A3|A1 at price $0.8. The corresponding payoff vector is: Υ = Υ A1A2A3 , Υ A1A2 ¯A3 , Υ A1 ¯A2A3 , . . . , Υ ¯A1 ¯A2 ¯A3 = 2 · 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, −0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0 2 3.2.3 The matching problem The auctioneers task, called the matching problem, is to determine which orders to accept among all orders o ∈ O. Let αi be the fraction of order oi accepted by the auctioneer (in the indivisible case, αi must be either 0 or 1; in the divisible case, αi can range from 0 to 1). If αi = 0, then order oi is considered rejected and no transactions take place concerning this order. For accepted orders (αi > 0), the auctioneer receives the money lost by bidders and pays out the money won by bidders, so the auctioneers payoff vector is: Υauc = X Υi∈P −αiΥi. We also call the auctioneers payoff vector the surplus vector, since it is the (possibly state-contingent) money left over after all accepted orders are filled. Assume that the auctioneer wants to choose a set of orders so that it is guaranteed not to lose any money in any future state, but that the auctioneer does not necessarily insist on obtaining a positive benefit from the transaction (i.e., the auctioneer is content to break even). Definition 1. (Matching problem, indivisible case) Given a set of orders O, does there exist αi ∈ {0, 1} with at least one αi = 1 such that ∀ω, Υ ω auc ≥ 0? In other words, does there exist a nonempty subset of orders that the auctioneer can accept without risk? 2 If ∀ω, Υ ω auc = c where c is nonnegative, then the surplus leftover after processing this match is c dollars. Let m = minω[Υ ω auc]. In general, processing a match leaves m dollars in cash and Υ ω auc − m in state-contingent dollars, which can then be translated into securities. Example 2. (Indivisible order matching) Suppose |A| = 2. Consider an order to buy one unit of A1A2 at price 0.4 and an order to sell one unit of A1 at price 0.3. The 147 corresponding payoff vectors are: Υ1 = Υ A1A2 1 ,Υ A1 ¯A2 1 ,Υ ¯A1A2 1 ,Υ ¯A1 ¯A2 1 = 0.6, −0.4, −0.4, −0.4 Υ2 = −0.7, −0.7, 0.3, 0.3 The auctioneers payoff vector (the negative of the componentwise sum of the above two vectors) is: Υauc = −Υ1 − Υ2 = 0.1, 1.1, 0.1, 0.1 . Since all components are nonnegative, the two orders match. The auctioneer can process both orders, leaving a surplus of $0.1 in cash and one unit of A1 ¯A2 in securities. 2 Now consider the divisible case, where order can be partially filled. Definition 2. (Matching problem, divisible case) Given a set of orders O, does there exist αi ∈ [0, 1] with at least one αi > 0 such that ∀ω, Υ ω auc ≥ 0, 2 Example 3. (Divisible order matching) Suppose |A| = 2. Consider an order to sell one unit of A1 at price $0.5, an order to buy one unit of A1A2|A1 ∨ A2 at price $0.5, and an order to buy one unit of A1| ¯A2 at price $0.4. The corresponding payoff vectors are: Υ1 = Υ A1A2 1 ,Υ A1 ¯A2 1 ,Υ ¯A1A2 1 ,Υ ¯A1 ¯A2 1 = −0.5, −0.5, 0.5, 0.5 Υ2 = 0.5, −0.5, −0.5, 0 Υ3 = 0, 0.6, 0, −0.4 It is clear by inspection that no non-empty subset of whole orders constitutes a match: in all cases where αi ∈ {0, 1} (other than all αi = 0), at least one state sums to a positive amount (negative for the auctioneer). However, if α1 = α2 = 3/5 and α3 = 1, then the auctioneers payoff vector is: Υauc = − 3 5 Υ1 − 3 5 Υ2 − Υ3 = 0, 0, 0, 0.1 , constituting a match. The auctioneer can process 3/5 of the first and second orders, and all of the third order, leaving a surplus of 0.1 units of ¯A1 ¯A2 . In this example, a divisible match exists even though an indivisible match is not possible; we examine the distinction in detail in Section 5, where we separate the two matching problems into distinct complexity classes. 2 The matching problems defined above are decision problems: the task is only to show the existence or nonexistence of a match. However, there may be multiple matches from which the auctioneer can choose. Sometimes the choices are equivalent from the auctioneers perspective; alternatively, an objective function can be used to find an optimal match according to that objective. Example 4. (Auctioneer alternatives I) Suppose |A| = 2. Consider an order to sell one unit of A1 at price $0.7, an order to sell one unit of A2 at price $0.7, an order to buy one unit of A1A2 at price $0.4, an order to buy one unit of A1 ¯A2 at price $0.4, and an order to buy one unit of ¯A1A2 at price $0.4. The corresponding payoff vectors are: Υ1 = −0.3,−0.3, 0.7, 0.7 Υ2 = −0.3, 0.7,−0.3, 0.7 Υ3 = 0.6,−0.4,−0.4,−0.4 Υ4 = −0.4, 0.6,−0.4,−0.4 Υ5 = −0.4,−0.4, 0.6,−0.4 Consider the indivisible case. The auctioneer could choose to accept bids 1, 3, and 4 together, or the auctioneer could choose to accept bids 2, 3, and 5 together. Both constitute matches, and in fact both yield identical payoffs (Υauc = 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 , or $0.1 in cash) for the auctioneer. 2 Example 5. (Auctioneer alternatives II) Suppose |A| = 2. Consider an order to sell two units of A1 at price $0.6, an order to buy one unit of A1A2 at price $0.3, and an order to buy one unit of A1 ¯A2 at price $0.5. The corresponding payoff vectors are: Υ1 = −0.4,−0.4, 0.6, 0.6 Υ2 = 0.7,−0.3,−0.3,−0.3 Υ3 = −0.5, 0.5,−0.5,−0.5 Consider the divisible case. The auctioneer could choose to accept one unit each of all three bids, yielding a payoff to the auctioneer of $0.2 in cash (Υauc = 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2 ). Alternatively, the auctioneer could choose to accept 4/3 units of bid 1, and one unit each of bids 2 and 3, yielding a payoff to the auctioneer of 1/3 units of security A1 . Both choices constitute matches (in fact, accepting any number of units of bid 1 between 1 and 4/3 can be part of a match), though depending on the auctioneers objective, one choice might be preferred over another. For example, if the auctioneer believes that A1 is very likely to occur, it may prefer to accept 4/3 units of bid 1. 2 There are many possible criteria for the auctioneer to decide among matches, all of which seem reasonable in some circumstances. One natural quantity to maximize is the volume of trade among bidders; another is the auctioneers utility, either with or without the arbitrage constraint. Definition 3. (Trade maximization problem) Given a set of indivisible (divisible) orders O, choose αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈ [0, 1]) to maximize X i αiqi, under the constraint that ∀ω, Υ ω auc ≥ 0. 2 Another reasonable variation is to maximize the total percent of orders filled, or P i αi, under the same (risk-free) constraint that ∀ω, Υ ω auc ≥ 0. Definition 4. (Auctioneer risk-free utility-maximization problem) Let the auctioneers subjective probability for each state ω be Pr(ω), and let the auctioneers utility for y dollars be u(y). Given a set of indivisible (divisible) orders O, choose αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈ [0, 1]) to maximize X ω∈Ω Pr(ω)u(Υ ω auc), 148 under the constraint that ∀ω, Υ ω auc ≥ 0. 2 Definition 5. (Auctioneer standard utility-maximization problem) Let the auctioneers subjective probability for each state ω be Pr(ω), and let the auctioneers utility for y dollars be u(y). Given a set of indivisible (divisible) orders O, choose αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈ [0, 1]) to maximize X ω∈Ω Pr(ω)u Υ ω auc . 2 This last objective function drops the risk-free (arbitrage) constraint. In this case, the auctioneer is a market maker with beliefs about the likelihood of outcomes, and the auctioneer may actually lose money is some outcomes. Still other variations and other optimization criteria seem reasonable, including social welfare, etc. It also seems reasonable to suppose that the surplus be shared among bidders and the auctioneer, rather than retained solely by the auctioneer. This is analogous to choosing a common transaction price in a double auction (e.g., the midpoint between the bid and ask prices), rather than the buyer paying the bid price and the seller receiving the ask price, with the difference going to the auctioneer. The problem becomes more complicated when dividing surplus securities, in part because they are valued differently by different agents. Formulating reasonable sharing rules and examining the resulting incentive properties seems a rich and promising avenue for further investigation. 4. MATCHING ALGORITHMS The straightforward algorithm for solving the divisible matching problem is linear programming; we set up an appropriate linear program in Section 5.1. The straightforward algorithm for solving the indivisible matching problem is integer programming. With n events, to set up the appropriate linear or integer programs, simply writing out the payoff vectors in the straightforward way requires O(2n ) space. There is some hope that specialized algorithms that exploit structure among bids can perform better in terms of average-case time and space complexity. For example, in some cases matches can be identified using logical reduction techniques, without writing down the full payoff vectors. So a match between the following bids: • sell 1 of A1A2 at $0.2 • sell 1 of A1 ¯A2 at $0.1 • buy 1 of A1 at $0.4 can be identified by reducing the first two bids to an equivalent offer to sell A1 at $0.3 that clearly matches with the third bid. Formalizing a logical-reduction algorithm for matching, or other algorithms that can exploit special structure among the bids, is a promising avenue for future work. 5. THE COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF MATCHING In this section we examine the computational complexity of the auctioneers matching problem. Here n refers to the problems input size that includes descriptions of all of the buy and sell orders. We also assume that n bounds the number of base securities. We consider four cases based on two parameters: 1. Whether to allow divisible or indivisible orders. 2. The number of securities. We consider two possibilities: (a) O(log n) base securities yielding a polynomial number of states. (b) An unlimited number of base securities yielding an exponential number of states. We show the following results. Theorem 1. The matching problem is 1. computable in polynomial-time for O(log n) base securities with divisible orders. 2. co-NP-complete for unlimited securities with divisible orders. 3. NP-complete for O(log n) base securities with indivisible orders. 4. Σp 2-complete for unlimited securities with indivisible orders. 5.1 Small number of securities with divisible orders We can build a linear program based on Definition 2. We have variables αi. For each i, we have 0 ≤ αi ≤ 1 and for each state ω in Ω we have the constraint Υ ω auc = X i −αiΥ ω i ≥ 0. Given these constraints we maximize X i αi. A set of orders has a matching exactly when P i αi > 0. With O(log n) base securities, we have |Ω| bounded by a polynomial so we can solve this linear program in polynomial time. Note that one might argue that one should maximize some linear combination of the −Υ ω i s to maximize the surplus. However this approach will not find matchings that have zero surplus. 5.2 Large number of securities with divisible orders With unlimited base securities, the linear program given in Section 5.1 has an exponential number of constraint equations. Each constraint is short to describe and easily computable given ω. 149 Let m ≤ n be the total number of buy and sell orders. By the theory of linear programming, an upper bound on the objective function can be forced by a collection of m + 1 constraints. So if no matching exists there must exist m + 1 constraints that force all the αi to zero. In nondeterministic polynomial-time we can guess these constraints and solve the reduced linear program. This shows that matching is in co-NP. To show co-NP-completeness we reduce the NP-complete problem of Boolean formula satisfiability to the nonexistence of a matching. Fix a formula φ. Let the base securities be the variables of φ and consider the single security φ with a buy order of 0.5. If the formula φ is satisfiable then there is some state with payoff 0.5 and no fractional unit of the security φ is a matching. If the formula φ is not satisfiable then every state has an auctioneers payoff of 0.5 and a single unit of the security φ is a matching. One could argue that if the formula φ is not satisfiable then no fully rational buyer would want to buy φ for a cost of 0.5. We can get around this problem by adding auxiliary base securities, A and B, and defining two securities τ = (φ ∧ A) ∨ (A ∧ B) τ = (φ ∧ A) ∨ (A ∧ B) with separate buy orders of 0.5 on each. If φ were satisfiable then in the state corresponding to the satisfying assignment and both A and B to be true, τ and τ both have an auctioneers payoff of −0.5 so even no divisible matching can exist. If φ were not satisfiable then one unit of each would be a matching since in every state at least one of τ or τ are false. 5.3 Small number of securities with indivisible orders This case is easily seen to be in NP: Just nondeterministically guess a nonempty subset S of orders and check for each state ω in Ω that Υ ω auc = X i∈S −Υ ω i ≥ 0. Since |Ω| and |S| are bounded by a polynomial in n, the verification can be done in polynomial time. To show that matching is NP-complete we reduce the NPcomplete problem EXACT COVER BY 3-SETS (X3C) to a matching of securities. The input to X3C consists of a set X and a collection C of 3-element subsets of X. The input (X, C) is in X3C if C contains an exact cover of X, i.e., there is a subcollection C of C such that every element of X occurs in exactly one member of C . Karp showed that X3C is NP-complete. Suppose we have an instance (X, C) with the vector X = {x1, . . . , x3q} and C = {c1, . . . , cm}. We set Ω = {e1, . . . , e3q, r, s} and define securities labelled φ1 , . . . , φm , ψ1 , . . . , ψq and τ , as follows: • Security φi is true in state r, and is true in state ek if k is not in ci. • Security ψj is true only in state s. • Security τ is true in each state ek but not r or s. We have buy orders on each φi and ψj security for 0.5 − 1 8q and a buy order on τ for 0.5. We claim that a matching exists if and only if (X, C) is in X3C. If (X, C) is in X3C, let C be the subcollection that covers each element of X exactly once. Note that |C | = q. We claim the collection consisting of φi for each ci in C , every ψj and τ has a matching. In each state ek we have an auctioneers payoff of (.5 − 1 8q ) + (q − 1)(−.5 − 1 8q ) + q(.5 − 1 8q ) − .5 = .5 − 2q 1 8q = .25 ≥ 0. In states r and s the auctioneers payoffs are −q(.5 + 1 8q ) + −q(−.5 + 1 8q ) + .5 = −5 − 2q 1 8q = .25 ≥ 0. Suppose now that (X, C) is not in X3C but there is a matching. Consider the number q of the φi in that matching and q the number of ψj in the matching. Since a matching requires a nonempty subset of the orders and τ by itself is not a matching we have q + q > 0. We have three cases. q > q: In state r, the auctioneers payoff is −q (.5 + 1 8q ) − q(−.5 + 1 8q ) + .5 ≤ −(q + q) 1 8q < 0. q > q : In state s, the auctioneers payoff is −q (.5 + 1 8q ) − q (−.5 + 1 8q ) + .5 ≤ −(q + q ) 1 8q < 0. q ≤ q ≤ q: Consider the set C consisting of the ci where φi is in the matching. There must be some state ek not in any of the ci or C would be an exact cover. The auctioneers payoff in ek is at most −q (.5 + 1 8q ) − q (−.5 + 1 8q ) ≤ −(q + q ) 1 8q < 0. 5.4 Large Number of Securities with Indivisible Orders The class Σp 2 is the second level of the polynomial-time hierarchy. A language L is in Σp 2 if there exists a polynomial p and a set A in P such that x is in L if and only if there is a y with |y| = p(|x|) such that for all z, with |z| = p(|x|), (x, y, z) is in A. The class Σp 2 contains both NP and coNP. Unless the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses (which is considered unlikely), a problem that is complete for Σp 2 is not contained in NP or co-NP. We will show that computing a matching is Σp 2-complete, and remains so even for quite restricted types of securities, and hence is (likely) neither in NP or co-NP. While it may seem that being NP-complete or co-NP-complete is hard enough, there are further practical consequences of being outside of NP and co-NP. If the matching problem were in NP, one could use heuristics to search for and verify a match if it exists; even if such heuristics fail in the worst case, they may succeed for most examples in practice. Similarly, if the matching problem were in co-NP, one might hope to at least heuristically rule out the possibility of matching. But for problems outside of NP or co-NP, there is no framework for verifying that a heuristically derived answer is correct. Less formally, for NP (or co-NP)-complete problems, you have to be lucky; for Σp 2-complete problems, you cant even tell if youve been lucky. 150 We note that the existence of a matching is in Σp 2: We use y to choose a subset of the orders and z to represent a state ω with (x, y, z) in A if the set of orders has a total nonpositive auctioneers payoff in state ω. We prove a stronger theorem which implies that matching is in Σp 2. Let S1, . . . , Sn be a set of securities, where each security Si has cost ci and pays off pi whenever formula Ci is satisfied. The 0 − 1-matching problem asks whether one can, by accepting either 0 or 1 of each security, guarantee a worst-case payoff strictly larger than the total cost. Theorem 2. The 0−1-matching problem is Σp 2-complete. Furthermore, the problem remains Σp 2-complete under the following two special cases: 1. For all i, Ci is a conjunction of 3 base events (or their negations), pi = 1, and ci = cj for all i and j. 2. For all i, Ci is a conjunction of at most 2 base securities (or their negations). These hardness results hold even if there is a promise that no subset of the securities guarantees a worst-case payoff identical to their cost. To prove Theorem 2, we reduce from the standard Σp 2 problem that we call T∃∀BF. Given a boolean formula φ with variables x1, . . . , xn and y1, . . . , yn is the following fullyquantified formula true ∃x1 . . . ∃xn∀y1 . . . ∀yn φ(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn)? The problem remains Σp 2-complete when φ(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn) is restricted to being a disjunction of conjunctions of at most 3 variables (or their negations), e.g., φ(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn) = (x1 ∧ ¯x3 ∧ y2) ∨ (x2 ∧ y3 ∧ y7) ∨ · · · . This form, without the bound on the conjunction size, is known as disjunctive normal form (DNF); the restriction to conjunctions of 3 variables is 3-DNF. We reduce T∃∀BF to finding a matching. For the simplest reduction, we consider the matching problem where one has a set of Arrow-Debreu securities whose payoff events are conjunctions of the base securities, or their negations. The auctioneer has the option of accepting either 0 or 1 of each of the given securities. We first reduce to the case where the payoff events are conjunctions of arbitrarily many base events (or their negations). By a standard trick we can reduce the number of base events in each conjunction to 3, and with a slight twist we can even ensure that all securities have the same price as well as the same payoff. Finally, we show that the problem remains hard even if only conjunctions of 2 variables are allowed, though with securities that deviate slightly from Arrow-Debreu securities in that they may have varying, non unit payoffs. 5.4.1 The basic reduction Before describing the securities, we give some intuition. The T∃∀BFproblem may be viewed as a game between a selector and an adversary. The selector sets the xi variables, and then the adversary sets the yi variables so as to falsify the formula φ. We can view the 0 − 1-matching problem as one in which the auctioneer is a buyer who buys securities corresponding to disjunctions of the base events, and then the adversary sets the values of the base events to minimize the payoff from the securities. We construct our securities so that the optimal buying strategy is to buy n expensive securities along with a set of cheap securities, of negligible cost (for some cases we can modify the construction so that all securities have the same cost). The total cost of the securities will be just under 1, and each security pays off 1, so the adversary must ensure that none of the securities pays off. Each expensive security forces the adversary to set some variable, xi to a particular value to prevent the security from paying off; this corresponds to setting the xi variables in the original game. The cheap securities are such that preventing every one of of these securities from paying off is equivalent to falsifying φ in the original game. Among the technical difficulties we face is how to prevent the buyer from buying conflicting securities, e.g., one that forces xi = 0 and the other that forces xi = 1, allowing for a trivial arbitrage. Secondly, for our analysis we need to ensure that a trader cannot spend more to get more, say by spending 1.5 for a set of securities with the property that at least 2 securities pay off under all possible events. For each of the variables {xi}, {yi} in φ, we add a corresponding base security (with the same labels). For each existential variable xi we add additional base securities, ni and zi. We also include a base security Q. In our basic construction, each expensive security costs C and each cheap security costs ; all securities pay off 1. We require that Cn+ (|cheap securities|) < 1 and C(n+1) > 1. That is, one can buy n expensive securities and all of the cheap securities for less than 1, but one cannot buy n + 1 expensive securities for less than 1. We at times refer to a security by its payoff clause. Remark: We may loosely think of as 0. However, this would allow one to buy a security for nothing that pays (in the worst case) nothing. By making > 0 , we can show it hard to distinguish portfolios that guarantee a positive profit from those that risk a positive loss. Setting > 0 will also allow us to show hardness results for the case where all securities have the same cost. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we have two expensive securities with payoff clauses (¯xi ∧Q) and (¯ni ∧Q) and two cheap securities with payoff clauses (xi ∧ ¯zi) and (ni ∧ ¯zi). For each clause C ∈ φ, we convert every negated variable ¯xi into ni and add the conjunction z1 ∧ · · · ∧ zn. Thus, for a clause C = (x2 ∧ ¯x7 ∧ ¯y5) we construct a cheap security SC, with payoff clause (z1 ∧ · · · ∧ zn ∧ x2 ∧ n7 ∧ ¯y5). Finally, we have a cheap security with payoff clause ( ¯Q). We now argue that a matching exists iff ∃x1 . . . ∃xn∀y1 . . . ∀yn φ(x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn). We do this by successively constraining the buyer and the adversary, eliminating behaviors that would cause the other player to win. The resulting reasonable strategies correspond exactly to the game version of T∃∀BF. First, observe that if the adversary sets all of the base securities to false (0), then only the ( ¯Q) security will pay off. 151 Thus, no buyer can buy more than n expensive securities and guarantee a profit. The problem is thus whether one can buy n expensive securities and all the cheap securities, so that at for any setting of the base events at least one security will pay off. Clearly, the adversary must make Q hold, or the ( ¯Q) security will pay off. Next, we claim that for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ i, the auctioneer must buy at least one of the (¯xi ∧ Q) and (¯ni ∧ Q) securities. This follow from the fact that if the adversary sets xi, ni and zi to be false, and every other base event to be true, then only the (¯xi ∧ Q) and (¯ni ∧ Q) securities will pay off. As no auctioneer can buy more than n expensive securities, it must therefore buy exactly one of (¯xi ∧ Q) or (¯ni ∧ Q), for each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n. For the rest of the analysis, we assume that the auctioneer follows this constraint. Suppose that the buyer buys (¯xi ∧Q). Then the adversary must set xi to be true (since it must set Q to be true), or the security will pay off. It must then set zi to be true or (xi∧¯zi) will pay off. Since the buyer doesnt buy (¯ni ∧ Q) (by the above constraint), and all the other securities pay the same or less when ni is made false, we can assume without loss of generality that the adversary sets ni to be false. Similarly, if the buyer buys (¯ni ∧ Q), then the adversary must set ni and zi to be true, and we can assume without loss of generality that the adversary sets xi to be false. Note that the adversary must in all cases set each zi event to be true. Summarizing the preceding argument, there is an exact correspondence between the rational strategies of the buyer and settings for the xi variables forced on the adversary. Furthermore, the adversary is also constrained to set the variables Q, z1, . . . , zn to be true, and without loss of generality may be assumed to set ni = ¯xi. Under these constraints, those securities not corresponding to clauses in φ are guaranteed to not pay off. The adversary also decides the value of the y1, . . . , ym base events. Recall that for each clause C ∈ φ there is a corresponding security SC. Given that zi is true and ni = ¯xi (without loss of generality), it follows from the construction of SC that the setting of the yis causes SC to pay off iff it satisfies C. This establishes the reduction from T∃∀BF to the matching problem, when the securities are constrained to be a conjunction of polynomially many base events or their negations. 5.4.2 Reducing to 3-variable conjunctions There are standard methods for reducing DNF formulae to 3-DNF formulae, which are trivially modifiable to our securities framework; we include the reduction for completeness. Given a security S whose payoff clause is C = (v1 ∧ v2 ∧ · · · ∧ vk) (variable negations are irrelevant to this discussion), cost c and payoff p, introduce a new auxiliary variable, w, and replace the security with two securities, S1 and S2, with payoff clauses, C1 = (v1 ∧ v2 ∧ w) and C2 = ( ¯w ∧ v3 ∧ · · · ∧ vk). The securities both have payoff p, and their costs can be any positive values that sum to c. Note that at most one of the securities can pay off at a time. If only one security is bought, then the adversary can always set w so that it wont pay off; hence the auctioneer will buy either both or neither, for a total cost of c (here we use the fact that one is only allowed to buy either 0 or 1 shares of each security). Then, it may be verified that, given the ability to set w arbitrarily, the adversary can cause C to be unsatisfied iff it can cause both C1 and C2 to be unsatisfied. Hence, owning one share each of S1 and S2 is equivalent to owning one share of S. Note that C1 has three variables and C2 has k−1 variables. By applying the transformation successively, one obtains an equivalent set of securities, of polynomial size, whose payoff clauses have at most 3 variables. We note that in the basic construction, all of the clauses with more than 3 variables are associated with cheap securities (cost ). Instead of subdividing costs, we can simply make all of the resulting securities have cost ; the constraints on C and must reflect the new, larger number of cheap securities. One can ensure that all of the payoff clauses have exactly 3 variables, with a similar construction. A security S with cost c, payoff p and defining clause (x ∧ y) can be replaced by securities S1 and S2 with cost c/2, payoff p and defining clauses (x∧y∧w) and (x∧y∧ ¯w), where w is a new auxiliary variable. Essentially the same analysis as given above applies to this case. The case of single-variable payoff clauses is handled by two applications of this technique. 5.4.3 Reducing to equi-cost securities By setting C and appropriately, one can ensure that in the basic reduction every security costs a polynomially bounded integer multiple of ; call this ratio r. We now show how to reduce this case to the case where every security costs . Recall that the expensive securities have payoff clauses (¯xi ∧ Q) or (¯ni ∧ Q). Assume that security S has payoff clause (¯xi ∧ Q) (the other case is handled identically). Replace S with security S , with payoff clause (¯xi ∧ Q ∧ w1) (w1, . . . , wr−1 are auxiliary variables; fresh variables are chosen for each clause), and also S1, . . . , Sr−1, with payoff clauses ( ¯w1 ∧ w2), ( ¯w2 ∧ w3), . . . , ( ¯wr−2 ∧ wr−1), and( ¯wr−1 ∧ ¯w1). Clearly, buying none of the new securities is equivalent to not buying the original security. We show that buying all of the new securities is equivalent to buying the original security, and that buying a proper, nonempty subset of the securities is irrational. We first note that if the buyer buys securities S1, . . . , Sr−1, then the adversary must set w1 to be true, or one of the securities will pay off. To see this, note that if wi is set to false, then ( ¯wi ∧wi+1) will be true unless wi+1 is set to false; thus, setting w1 to false forces the adversary to set wr−1 to false, causing the final clause to be true. Having set w1 true, the adversary can set w2, . . . , wr−1 to false, ensuring that none of the securities S1, . . . , Sr−1 pays out. If wi is true, then (¯xi ∧ Q ∧ w1) is equivalent to (¯xi ∧ Q). So buying all of the replacement securities for each is equivalent to buying the original security for r. It remains to show that buying a proper, nonempty subset of the securities is irrational. If one doesnt buy S , then the adversary can set the w variables so that none of S1, . . . , Sr−1 will pay off; any money spent on these securities is wasted. If one doesnt buy Sr−1, the adversary can set all w to false, in which case none of the new clauses will pay off, regardless of the value of xi and Q. Similarly, if one 152 doesnt buy Si, for 1 ≤ i ≤ r −2, the adversary can set wi+1 to be true, all the other w variables to be false, and again there is no payoff, regardless of the value of xi and Q. Thus, buying a proper subset of these securities will not increase ones payoff. We note that this reduction can be combined trivially with the reduction that ensures that all of the defining clauses have 3 or fewer variables. With a slightly messier argument, all of the defining clauses can be set up to have exactly 3 variables. 5.4.4 Reducing to clauses of at most 2 variables If we allow securities to have variable payoffs and prices, we can reduce to the case where each securitys payoff clause is a conjunction of at most 2 variables or their negations. Given a security s with payoff clause (X ∧ Y ∧ Z), cost c and payoff 1, we introduce fresh auxiliary variables, w1, w2 and w3 (new variables are used for each clause) and replace S with the following securities: • Securities S1, S2 and S3, each with cost c/3 and payoff 1, with respective payoff clauses (X ∧ w1), (Y ∧ w2) and (Z ∧ w3). • Securities S1, . . . , S6, each with cost 4 and payoff 24 − 2, with payoff clauses, (w1 ∧ w2) (w1 ∧ w3) (w2 ∧ w3) ( ¯w1 ∧ ¯w2) ( ¯w1 ∧ ¯w3) ( ¯w2 ∧ ¯w3) Here, 2 is a tiny positive quantity, described later. By a simple case analysis, we have the following. Observations: 1. For any i, there exists a setting of w1, w2 an w3 such that of the S securities only Si pays off. 2. For any setting of w1, w2 and w3, at least one of the S securities will pay off. 3. If w1, w2 and w3 are all false, all of the S securities will pay off. 4. Setting one of w1, w2 or w3 to be true, and the others to be 0, will cause exactly one of the S securities to pay off. By Observation 1, there is no point in buying a nonempty proper subset of the S securities: The adversary can ensure that none of the bought securities will pay off, and even if all the S securities pay off, it will not be sufficient to recoup the cost of buying a single S security. By Observation 2, if one buys all the S securities, one is guaranteed to almost make back ones investment (except for 2), in which case by Observations 3 and 4, the adversaries optimal strategy is to make exactly one of w1, w2 or w3 true. We set C, and 2 so that Cn + (|cheap securities|) + 2(|clauses|) < 1. Thus, the accumulated losses of 2 can never spell the difference between making a guaranteed profit and making no profit at all. Note also that by making 2 positive we prevent the existence of break-even buying strategies in which the buyer only purchases S securities. Summarizing the previous argument, we may assume without loss of generality that the buyer buys all of the S securities (for all clauses), and that for each clause the adversary sets exactly one of that clauses auxiliary variables w1, w2 or w3 to be true. For the rest of the discussion, we assume that the players follow these constraints. We next claim that a rational buyer will either buy all of S1, S2 or S3, or none of them. If the buyer doesnt buy S1, then if the adversary makes w1 true and w2 and w3 false, neither S2 nor S3 will pay off, regardless of how the adversary sets X, Y and Z. Hence, there is no point in buying either S2 or S3 if one doesnt buy S1. Applying the same argument to S2 and S3 establishes the claim. Clearly, buying none of S1, S2 and S3 has, up to negligible 2 factors, the same price/payoff behavior as not buying S. We next argue that, subject to the established constraints put on the players behaviors, buying all of S1, S2 and S3 has the same price/payoff behavior (again ignoring 2 factors) as buying S, regardless of how the adversary sets X, Y and Z. First, in both cases, the cost is c. If the adversary makes X, Y and Z true, then S pays off 1, and (assuming that exactly one of w1, w2 and w3 is true), exactly one of S1, S2 or S3 will pay off 1. If X is false, then S doesnt pay off, and the adversary can set w1 true (and w2 and w3 false), ensuring that none of S1, S2 and S3 pays off. The same argument holds if Y or Z are false. 6. TRACTABLE CASES The logical question to ask in light of these complexity results is whether further, more severe restrictions on the space of securities can enable tractable matching algorithms. Although we have not systematically explored the possibilities, the potential for useful tractable cases certainly exists. Suppose, for example, that bids are limited to unit quantities of securities of the following two forms: 1. Disjunctions of positive events: A1 ∨ · · · ∨ Ak . 2. Single negative events: ¯Ai . Let p be the price offered for a disjunction A1 ∨ · · · ∨ Ak , and qi the maximal price offered for the respective negated disjuncts. This disjunction bid is part of a match iff p +P i qi ≥ k. Evaluating whether this condition is satisfied by a subset of bids is quite straightforward. Although this example is contrived, its application is not entirely implausible. For example, the disjunctions may correspond to insurance customers, who want an insurance contract to cover all the potential causes of their asset loss. The atomic securities are sold by insurers, each of whom specialize in a different form of disaster cause. 7. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS We have analyzed the computational complexity of matching for securities based on logical formulas. Many possible avenues for future work exist, including 1. Analyzing the agents optimization problem: • How to choose quantities and bid/ask prices for a collection of securities to maximizes ones expected utility, both for linear and nonlinear utility functions. 153 • How to choose securities; that is, deciding on what collection of boolean formulas to offer to trade, subject to constraints or penalties on the number or complexity of bids. • How do make the above choices in a game theoretically sound way, taking into account the choices of other traders, their reasoning about other traders, etc. 2. Although matching is likely intractable, are there good heuristics that achieve matches in many cases or approximate a matching? 3. Exploring sharing rules for dividing the surplus, and incentive properties of the resulting mechanisms. 4. We may consider a market to be in computational equilibrium if no computationally-bounded player can find a strategy that increases utility. With few exceptions [3, 22], little is known about computational equilibriums. A natural question is to determine whether a market can achieve a computational equilibrium that is not a true equilibrium, and under what circumstances this may occur.

Pennock ∗ Oventure Services, Inc., 3er piso 74 N. Pasadena Ave pasadena, CA, CA91103 Michael P. Wellman University of Michigan AI Laboratory 1101 Beal Avenue Ann Arbor, MI 48109 Resumen Desarrollamos un marco para operar en valores compuestos: instrumentos financieros que pagan dependiendo de los resultados de declaraciones arbitrarias en la lógica proposicional. Comprar o vender valores, que se puede considerar como apuestas sobre o en contra de los agentes de permisos futuros particulares, tanto para cubrir el riesgo como para obtener ganancias (en expectativas) en predicciones subjetivas. Un mercado de valores compuestos permite a los agentes hacer apuestas en combinaciones arbitrarias de eventos booleanos, permitiéndoles lograr más de cerca su exposición óptima al riesgo y permitir que el mercado en su conjunto alcance más de cerca el óptimo social. La compensación para permitir dicha expresividad está en la complejidad de los problemas de optimización de agentes y subastadores. Desarrollamos y motivamos el concepto de un mercado de valores compuestos, presentando el marco a través de una serie de definiciones y ejemplos formales. Luego analizamos en detalle el problema de coincidencia de los subastadores. Mostramos que, con n eventos, el problema de correspondencia es CO-NP-complete en el caso divisible y σp 2-completan en el caso indivisible. Mostramos que este último resultado de dureza se mantiene incluso bajo restricciones de lenguaje severas en las ofertas. Con los eventos log n, el problema es polinomio en el caso divisible y NP-complete en el caso indivisible. Discutimos brevemente algoritmos coincidentes y casos especiales manejables.

Introducción Los mercados de valores permiten efectivamente a los comerciantes hacer apuestas sobre los resultados de las proposiciones futuras inciertas. Los ejemplos incluyen mercados de valores como NASDAQ, mercados de opciones como CBOE [17], mercados de futuros como CME [30], otros mercados de derivados, mercados de seguros, mercados de valores políticos [11, 12], mercados de apuestas deportivas [7, 13, 32],Los mercados de carreras de caballos [33], los mercados de futuros de ideas [16], los mercados de decisiones [14] e incluso los juegos de mercado [4, 24, 25]. El valor económico de los mercados de valores es doble. Primero, permiten a los comerciantes cubrir el riesgo, o asegurarse contra resultados indeseables. Por ejemplo, el propietario de una acción podría comprar una opción de venta (el derecho de vender la acción a un precio particular) para asegurar una recesión de acciones. O el propietario de una casa puede comprar un contrato de seguro para protegerse contra daños imprevistos a la casa. En segundo lugar, los mercados de valores permiten a los operadores especular, o obtener una ganancia subjetiva esperada cuando los precios del mercado no reflejan su evaluación de la probabilidad de resultados futuros. Por ejemplo, un operador podría comprar una opción de compra si cree que la probabilidad es alta que el precio de las acciones subyacentes aumente, independientemente de la exposición al riesgo a los cambios en el precio de las acciones. Debido a que los comerciantes tienen ganancias si pueden obtener evaluaciones de probabilidad efectivas, a menudo los precios en los mercados financieros producen pronósticos agregados muy precisos de eventos futuros [10, 29, 27, 28]. Los mercados de valores reales tienen estructuras de pago complejas con varios desencadenantes. Sin embargo, todas estas pueden modelarse como colecciones de valores de DEBREU de flecha más básicos o atómicos [1, 8, 20]. Se produce una unidad de una seguridad de flecha-debreu paga un dólar si y solo si (iff) ocurre un evento binario correspondiente;No paga nada si el evento no ocurre. Entonces, por ejemplo, una unidad de un ACME100 denotado de seguridad podría pagar $ 1 Las acciones de IFF ACMES están por encima de $ 100 el 4 de enero de 2004. Una opción de acciones de ACME, ya que se definiría en un intercambio cial finan144, aunque puede ser como una cartera de tales valores atómicos.1 En este documento, desarrollamos y analizamos un marco para negociar en mercados de valores compuestos con pagos que dependen de combinaciones lógicas arbitrariasde eventos, incluidos condicionales. Por ejemplo, dados los eventos binarios A, B y C, un comerciante podría ofertar para comprar tres unidades de una seguridad denotó un ∧ ¯b ∨ c que paga $ 1 si el evento compuesto a ∧ ¯b ∨ c ocurre por treinta centavos cada uno cada uno. Otro comerciante puede ofertar para vender seis unidades de seguridad a | C que paga $ 1 IFF A ocurre por cincuenta y cinco centavos cada una, condicionada al evento C que ocurre, lo que significa que la transacción se revoca si C no ocurre (es decir, no hay pagos, sin pago.se da y el precio de la seguridad se reembolsa) [5]. Las ofertas también pueden ser divisibles, lo que significa que los licitadores están dispuestos a aceptar menos de la cantidad solicitada, o indivisible, lo que significa que las ofertas deben cumplirse completamente o no. Dado un conjunto de tales ofertas, el subastador enfrenta un problema de correspondencia complejo para decidir qué ofertas son aceptadas por cuántas unidades a qué precio. Por lo general, el subastador busca asumir ningún riesgo propio, solo coinciden con operaciones agradables entre los postores, pero también consideramos formulaciones alternativas donde el subastador actúa como un fabricante de mercado dispuesto a aceptar cierto riesgo. Examinamos la complejidad computacional del problema de coincidencia de los subastadores. Deje que la longitud de la descripción de todos los valores disponibles sea o (n). Con N eventos, el problema de correspondencia es CO-NP-COMPLETO en el caso divisible y σp 2 complete en el caso indivisible. Esta dureza completa de σp 2 se mantiene incluso cuando el lenguaje de licitación está significativamente restringido. Con los eventos log n, el problema es polinomio en el caso divisible y NP-complete en el caso indivisible. La Sección 2 presenta la información de fondo, la motivación y el trabajo relacionado necesarios. La Sección 3 describe formalmente nuestro marco para valores compuestos y define el problema de coincidencia de los subastadores. La Sección 4 analiza brevemente los algoritmos naturales para resolver el problema de correspondencia. La Sección 5 prueba nuestros resultados de complejidad computacional central. La Sección 6 analiza la posibilidad de casos especiales manejables. La Sección 7 concluye con un resumen y algunas ideas de direcciones futuras.2. Preliminares 2.1 Antecedentes y notación Imagine un mundo donde solo hay dos eventos inciertos futuros de cualquier consecuencia: (1) el evento de que Ones House es alcanzado por Lightning antes del 31 de diciembre de 2003, denotó Struck, y (2) el evento de que Acmes StockEl precio supera los $ 100 antes del 4 de enero de 2004, denotó ACME100. En este mundo simple hay cuatro posibles estados futuros, todas las combinaciones posibles de los resultados de los eventos binarios: golpeó ∧ acme100, golpeó ∧ acme100, golpeó ∧ acme100, golpeó ∧ acme100. El riesgo de cobertura puede considerarse como una acción para mover dinero entre varios posibles estados futuros. Por ejemplo, Insur1 técnicamente, una opción es una cartera de valores atómicos infinitamente, aunque puede modelarse aproximadamente con un número finito.La casa de la casa transfiere dinero de futuros estados donde golpeado no es fiel a los estados donde está. Vender un ACME100 denotado de seguridad que paga $ 1 IFF El evento ACME100 ocurre que transfiere dinero de futuros estados donde el precio de ACMES es superior a $ 100 el 4 de enero para los estados donde no está. Especular también es un acto de transferir dinero entre futuros estados, aunque generalmente se asocia con la maximización del rendimiento esperado en lugar de reducir el riesgo. Por ejemplo, apostar a un equipo de fútbol mueve dinero del equipo pierde el estado ante el equipo gana el estado. En la práctica, los agentes participan en una mezcla de cobertura y especulación, y no hay una línea divisoria clara entre los dos [18]. Todos los resultados futuros posibles forman un espacio de estado Ω, que consiste en estados mutuamente excluyentes y exhaustivos ω ∈ Ω. A menudo, una forma más natural de pensar en posibles resultados futuros es como un espacio de eventos de eventos linealmente independientes a ∈ A que puede superponerse arbitrariamente. Entonces, en nuestro ejemplo de juguete, golpeó ∧ ACME100 es uno de los cuatro estados disjuntos, mientras que Struck es uno de los dos eventos. Tenga en cuenta que un conjunto de n eventos linealmente independientes define un espacio de estado Ω de tamaño 2n que consiste en todas las combinaciones posibles de los resultados del evento. Por el contrario, cualquier espacio de estado ω se puede tener en cuenta en log | ω |eventos. Supongamos que una cubierta exhaustiva todos los resultados futuros significativos (es decir, cubre todas las eventualidades que los agentes pueden desear cubrir y/o especular). Entonces la existencia de 2n de valores linealmente independientes calculó a los agentes de mercado completos para distribuir su riqueza arbitrariamente en los estados futuros.2 Un agente puede crear cualquier cobertura o especulación que desee. En condiciones clásicas, los agentes que cotizan en un mercado completo forman un equilibrio donde el riesgo se asigna pareto de manera óptima. Si el mercado está incompleto, lo que significa que consiste en menos de 2n valores linealmente independientes, entonces en general, los agentes no pueden construir setos arbitrarios y las asignaciones de equilibrio pueden ser no óptimas [1, 8, 19, 20]. En la configuración del mundo real, el número de eventos significativos n es grande y, por lo tanto, el número de valores requeridos para la integridad es intratable. No existirá ni existirá ningún mercado verdaderamente completo. Una motivación detrás de los mercados de valores compuestos es proporcionar un mecanismo que respalde la mayor transferencia de riesgo utilizando el menor número de transacciones posibles. Los valores compuestos permiten un alto grado de expresividad en la construcción de ofertas. La compensación por una mayor expresividad es una mayor complejidad computacional, tanto desde el punto de vista de los postores como de los subastadores.2.2 Trabajo relacionado La búsqueda para reducir el número de instrumentos financieros necesarios para respaldar una asignación óptima de las fechas de riesgo a las flechas del trabajo original [1]. El requisito indicado anteriormente de solo 2n valores independientes linealmente es una reducción de la formulación más directa. En una economía con k bienes estándar, el mercado completo más sencillo contiene K · 2n valores, cada uno de los cuales vale la pena en una buena realización de un estado. Arrow [1] mostró que un mercado donde los valores y los bienes están esencialmente separados, con 2n valores que dan sus frutos en un solo Numeroire Good Plus K Spot Markets en los bienes estándar, también se completa. Para nuestros propósitos, necesitamos considerar solo el mercado de valores.2 Por valores linealmente independientes, queremos decir que los vectores de pagos en todos los estados futuros de estos valores son linealmente independientes.145 Varian [34] muestra que se puede construir un mercado completo utilizando menos de 2n valores, reemplazando los valores faltantes con opciones. Aún así, el número de seguridad de instrumentos financieros linealmente independientes más opciones debe ser 2n para garantizar la integridad. Aunque el requisito de 2n instrumentos financieros no puede relajarse si uno quiere garantizar la integridad en todas las circunstancias, Pennock y Wellman [26] exploran las condiciones bajo las cuales un mercado de valores más pequeño puede estar operativamente completo, lo que significa que su equilibrio es pareto óptimo con respecto a laAgentes involucrados, incluso si el mercado contiene menos de 2n valores. Los autores muestran que, en algunos casos, el mercado puede estructurarse y compactarse en analogía con las representaciones de la red bayesiana de distribuciones de probabilidad conjunta [23]. Muestran que, si todas las independencias neutrales en el riesgo de los agentes están de acuerdo con las independencias codificadas en la estructura del mercado, entonces el mercado está operacionalmente completo. Para las colecciones de agentes, todos con aversión constante al riesgo absoluto, el acuerdo sobre las independencias de Markov es suficiente. Bossaerts, Fine y Ledyard [2] desarrollan un mecanismo que llaman al comercio de valor combinado (CVT) que permite a los comerciantes ordenar una cartera arbitraria de valores en una oferta, en lugar de romper el orden en una secuencia de ofertas en valores individuales. Si se acepta la orden de la cartera, todas las operaciones implícitas en valores individuales se ejecutan simultáneamente, eliminando así el llamado riesgo de ejecución de que los precios cambian en el medio de una secuencia planificada de pedidos. Los autores realizan experimentos de laboratorio que muestran que, incluso en mercados delgados donde se descompone el comercio secuencial ordinario, CVT admite precios y asignación eficientes. Tenga en cuenta que la CVT difiere significativamente de la negociación de valores compuestos. CVT permite el comercio instantáneo de cualquier combinación lineal de valores, mientras que los valores compuestos permiten valores más expresivos que pueden codificar combinaciones booleanas no lineales de eventos. Por ejemplo, CVT puede permitir que un agente ordene los valores A y B en un paquete que vale la pena como una combinación lineal de A y B, 3, pero CVT no permitirá la construcción de una seguridad compuesta A ∧ B que paga $ 1 tantoy b ocurren, o una seguridad compuesta a | b. Se relacionan con CVT subastas combinatorias [6, 21] e intercambios [31], mecanismos que recientemente han recibido bastante atención en la literatura de economía y ciencias de la computación. Las subastas combinatorias permiten a los licitadores colocar valores distintos en todos los paquetes posibles de bienes en lugar de solo en bienes individuales. De esta manera, los licitadores pueden expresar la sustituibilidad y las relaciones de complementariedad entre los bienes que no pueden expresarse en subastas paralelas o secuenciales estándar. Los valores compuestos difieren de las subastas combinatorias en concepto y complejidad. Los valores compuestos permiten a los licitadores construir una apuesta arbitraria en cualquiera de los 22 nidos eventos compuestos posibles expresados como funciones lógicas de los n eventos básicos, condicionales en cualquier otro de los 22n eventos compuestos. Los agentes optimizan en función de sus propias probabilidades subjetivas y actitud de riesgo (y en general, sus creencias sobre las creencias y servicios públicos de otros agentes, ad Infinitum). El problema central del subastador es identificar oportunidades de arbitraje: es decir, coincidir con las apuestas juntas sin asumir ningún riesgo. Las subastas combinatorias, por otro lado, permiten ofertas en cualquiera de los 2n paquetes de productos n. Por lo general, 3 específicamente, una unidad de cada uno paga $ 2 IFF tanto A como B ocurren, $ 1 IFF A o B ocurre (pero no ambos) y $ 0 de ninguna manera.incertidumbre y, por lo tanto, el riesgo no se considera. El problema del subastador central es maximizar el bienestar social. También tenga en cuenta que los problemas se encuentran en diferentes clases de complejidad. Si bien la limpieza de una subasta combinatoria es polinomio en el caso divisible y NP-complete en el caso indivisible, la coincidencia en un mercado de valores compuestos es NP-NP en el caso divisible y σp 2-complete en el caso indivisible. De hecho, incluso el problema de decidir si dos ofertas en valores compuestos coinciden, incluso en el caso divisible, es NP-complete (ver Sección 5.2). Existe un sentido en el que es posible traducir nuestro problema de correspondencia para valores compuestos en un problema análogo para limpiar los intercambios combinatorios de dos lados [31] de tamaño exponencial. Específicamente, si consideramos el pago en un estado en particular como bien, entonces los valores compuestos pueden verse como paquetes de (cantidades fraccionales de) dichos bienes. La restricción de equilibrio material que enfrenta el subastador combinatorial corresponde a una restricción de que el subastador de seguridad compuesta se no permitir que suponga ningún riesgo. Tenga en cuenta que esta traducción no es útil para abordar el problema de coincidencia de seguridad compuesta, ya que el intercambio combinatorio resultante tiene un número exponencial de bienes. Hanson [15] desarrolla un mecanismo de mercado llamado una regla de puntuación del mercado que es especialmente adecuada para permitir apuestas en un número combinatorio de resultados. El mecanismo mantiene una distribución de probabilidad conjunta en todos los estados 2n, ya sea explícita o implícitamente utilizando una red bayesiana u otra representación compacta. En cualquier momento, cualquier comerciante que crea que las probabilidades son incorrectas puede cambiar cualquier parte de la distribución aceptando un boleto de lotería que valga la pena de acuerdo con una regla de puntuación (por ejemplo, la regla de puntuación logarítmica) [35], siempre y cuando ese comerciante también esté de acuerdoPara pagar a la persona más reciente para cambiar la distribución. En el límite de un solo comerciante, el mecanismo se comporta como una regla de puntuación, adecuada para encuestar a un solo agente para su distribución de probabilidad. En el límite de muchos comerciantes, produce una estimación combinada. Dado que el mercado siempre tiene un conjunto completo de precios publicados para todos los resultados posibles, el mecanismo evita el problema de los mercados delgados, o la iliquidez, que necesariamente afecta a cualquier mercado que contenga un número exponencial de inversiones alternativas. El mecanismo requiere que un patrón pague a la persona final para cambiar la distribución, aunque el pago de los clientes está limitado. Aunque Hanson ofrece algunas sugerencias iniciales, quedan varios problemas abiertos, incluidos métodos eficientes para representar y actualizar las posiciones y carteras de la distribución y registro de los operadores de registro, sin recurrir a algoritmos de tiempo y espacio exponenciales. Fagin, Halpern y Megiddo [9] dan una axiomatización sólida y completa para decidir si los conjuntos de desigualdades probabilísticas son consistentes. Las ofertas para valores compuestos pueden considerarse como expresiones de desigualdades probabilísticas: por ejemplo, una oferta para comprar un ∧ B al precio 0.3 es una declaración de que la probabilidad de A ∧ B es mayor que 0.3. Si un conjunto de ofertas de una sola unidad corresponde a un conjunto de desigualdades probabilísticas inconsistentes, entonces hay una coincidencia. Sin embargo, debido a que están interesados en un marco muy diferente, Fagin et al.No considere varios factores complicados específicos para el marco del mercado de valores: a saber, manejar cantidades de ofertas múltiples o fraccionadas, identificar coincidencias, elegir entre múltiples coincidencias y optimizar según las probabilidades y las actitudes de riesgo. Abordamos estos problemas a continuación.146 3. Marco para el comercio de valores compuestos 3.1 Descripción de alto nivel El conocimiento común entre los agentes es el conjunto de eventos A. No hay valores predefinidos. En cambio, los agentes ofrecen comprar o vender valores de su propio diseño que pagan contingentes en combinaciones lógicas de eventos y negaciones de eventos. Los operadores de combinación pueden incluir conjunciones, disyunciones y condicionales. Para todos los fines prácticos, es imposible que los agentes intercambien suficientes valores (2n) para formar un mercado completo, por lo que los agentes deben idear su mejor compensación entre el número y la complejidad de sus ofertas, y la medida en que sus riesgos están cubiertos ySe colocan apuestas deseables. En su forma más general, el problema es la naturaleza teórica del juego, ya que lo que debe ofrecer un agente depende de lo que crea que otros agentes aceptarán. En el otro extremo del espectro, una versión simplificada del problema es optimizar las ofertas solo en los valores disponibles actualmente a los precios actuales. Entre estas dos formulaciones hay otros posibles problemas de optimización interesantes. También se pueden seguir algoritmos de aproximación. El subastador enfrenta un problema no trivial de igualar los pedidos de compra y venta para maximizar el excedente (el efectivo y los valores que quedan después de que se cumplen las ofertas aceptadas). Por ejemplo, las ofertas de vender A1A2 a $ 0.2 y A1 ¯a2 a $ 0.1 pueden igualar con una oferta de comprar A1 a $ 0.4, con excedente $ 0.1. O una oferta de vender A1 a $ 0.3 puede igualar con una oferta de comprar A1A2 a $ 0.4, con excedentes de $ 0.1 en efectivo y A1 ¯a2 en valores. En general, una sola seguridad podría calificar para múltiples coincidencias, pero solo uno puede ser transacciones. Por lo tanto, el subastador debe encontrar el conjunto óptimo de coincidencias que maximiza el excedente, que podría medirse de varias maneras. Nuevamente, se pueden considerar algoritmos de aproximación. En otra formulación, el subastador funciona como un fabricante de mercado dispuesto a asumir una cierta cantidad de riesgo. Informalmente, nuestra motivación es proporcionar un mecanismo que permita un grado muy alto de expresividad para colocar setos y apuestas, y también es capaz de aproximar la asignación óptima (mercado completo) de riesgo, negociando el número y la complejidad de los valores y las transaccionesnecesario.3.2 Descripción formal 3.2.1 Valores Usamos φ y ψ para denotar fórmulas booleanas arbitrarias, o combinaciones lógicas de eventos en A. Los valores pagan $ 1 si y solo if (iff) φ y ψ son verdaderos, pagan $ 0 IFF φ es falso y ψ es verdadero, y se cancelan (es decir, cualquier precio pagado se reembolsa) IFF ψ es falso. Definimos que T ≡ Ω es el evento verdadero y f ≡ ∅ como el evento falso. Abreviamos φ | t como φ.3.2.2 Pedidos Los agentes colocan pedidos, denotados o, de la forma Q unidades de φ | ψ al precio P por unidad, donde q> 0 implica una orden de compra y q <0 implica un pedido de venta. Suponemos que los agentes que envían pedidos de compra (venta) aceptarán cualquier precio P ∗ ≤ P (P ∗ ≥ P). Distinguemos entre órdenes divisibles e indivisibles. Los agentes que presentan órdenes divisibles aceptarán cualquier cantidad αq donde 0 <α ≤ 1. Los agentes que presentan órdenes indivisibles aceptarán solo exactamente las unidades Q, o ninguna. Creemos que, dada la naturaleza de lo que se está negociando (dólares contingentes del estado), la mayoría de los agentes se contentarán con comerciar utilizando órdenes divisibles. Cada orden o se puede traducir a un vector de pago υ en todos los estados Ω ∈ Ω. El pago υ ω en el estado ω es q · 1Ω∈ψ (1Ω∈uaciónst. Recuerde que los estados 2N corresponden a las posibles combinaciones de resultados del evento. Indexamos múltiples pedidos con subíndices (por ejemplo, OI y υi). Deje que el conjunto de todos los pedidos sea O y el conjunto de todos los vectores de pago correspondientes sea P. Ejemplo 1. (Traducir órdenes en vectores de pago) Suponga que | A |= 3. Considere una orden para comprar dos unidades de A2 ∨ A3 | A1 al precio $ 0.8. El vector de pago correspondiente es: υ = υ a1a2a3, υ a1a2 ¯a3, υ a1 ¯a2a3 ,..., Υ ¯a1 ¯a2 ¯a3 = 2 · 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, −0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0 2 3.2.3 El problema de correspondencia La tarea de los subastadores, llamada problema coincidente, es determinar qué órdenes aceptarEntre todos los órdenes o ∈ O. Sea αi la fracción de orden de aceptación por el subastador (en el caso indivisible, αi debe ser 0 o 1; en el caso divisible, αi puede variar de 0 a 1). Si αi = 0, entonces el orden OI se considera rechazado y no se realizan transacciones con respecto a este orden. Para los pedidos aceptados (αi> 0), el subastador recibe el dinero perdido por los postores y paga el dinero ganado por los postores, por lo que el vector de pago de los subastadores es: υAuc = x υi∈P −αiυi. También llamamos al vector de pago de los subastadores el vector excedente, ya que es el dinero (posiblemente contingente del estado) que queda después de que se completen todos los pedidos aceptados. Suponga que el subastador quiere elegir un conjunto de órdenes para que esté garantizado no perder dinero en ningún estado futuro, pero que el subastador no necesariamente insiste en obtener un beneficio positivo de la transacción (es decir, el subastador está contento acubrir los gastos). Definición 1. (problema coincidente, caso indivisible) Dado un conjunto de órdenes o, ¿existe αi ∈ {0, 1} con al menos un αi = 1 tal que ∀Ω, υ Ω auc ≥ 0? En otras palabras, ¿existe un subconjunto de órdenes no vacío que el subastador puede aceptar sin riesgo?2 Si ∀ω, υ Ω auc = c donde c no es negativo, entonces el excedente sobrante después de procesar esta coincidencia es c dólares. En general, el procesamiento de una coincidencia deja M dólares en efectivo y υ Ω auc-m en dólares contingentes estatales, que luego pueden traducirse a valores. Ejemplo 2. (coincidencia de orden indivisible) Supongamos | A |= 2. Considere una orden para comprar una unidad de A1A2 al precio 0.4 y una orden para vender una unidad de A1 al precio 0.3. Los 147 vectores de pago correspondientes son: υ1 = υ a1a2 1, υ a1 ¯a2 1, υ ¯a1a2 1, υ ¯a1 ¯a2 1 = 0.6, −0.4, −0.4, −0.4 υ2 = −0.7, −0.7, 0.3, 0.3 El vector de pago de los subastadores (el negativo de la suma componente de los dos vectores anteriores) es: υAuc = −υ1 - υ2 = 0.1, 1.1, 0.1, 0.1. Dado que todos los componentes no son negativos, los dos órdenes coinciden. El subastador puede procesar ambos pedidos, dejando un excedente de $ 0.1 en efectivo y una unidad de A1 ¯a2 en valores.2 Ahora considere el caso divisible, donde el orden se puede llenar parcialmente. Definición 2. (problema coincidente, caso divisible) dado un conjunto de órdenes o, ¿existe αi ∈ [0, 1] con al menos un αi> 0 tal que ∀Ω, υ ω auc ≥ 0, 2 Ejemplo 3. ((Matricante de orden divisible) Supongamos | A |= 2. Considere una orden para vender una unidad de A1 al precio $ 0.5, una orden para comprar una unidad de A1A2 | A1 ∨ A2 al precio $ 0.5, y una orden para comprar una unidad de A1 |¯a2 al precio $ 0.4. Los vectores de pago correspondientes son: υ1 = υ a1a2 1, υ a1 ¯a2 1, υ ¯a1a2 1, υ ¯a1 ¯a2 1 = −0.5, −0.5, 0.5, 0.5 υ2 = 0.5, −0.5, −0.5, 0.0, 0.Υ3 = 0, 0.6, 0, −0.4 está claro por inspección que ningún subconjunto no vacío de órdenes completas constituye una coincidencia: en todos los casos en que αi ∈ {0, 1} (aparte de todos αi = 0), al menosUn estado resume a una cantidad positiva (negativa para el subastador). Sin embargo, si α1 = α2 = 3/5 y α3 = 1, entonces el vector de pago de los subastadores es: υAuc = - 3 5 υ1 - 3 5 υ2 - υ3 = 0, 0, 0, 0.1, constituyendo una coincidencia. El subastador puede procesar 3/5 de la primera y segunda órdenes, y todo el tercer pedido, dejando un excedente de 0.1 unidades de ¯a1 ¯a2. En este ejemplo, existe una coincidencia divisible a pesar de que no es posible una coincidencia indivisible;Examinamos la distinción en detalle en la Sección 5, donde separamos los dos problemas coincidentes en clases de complejidad distintas.2 Los problemas coincidentes definidos anteriormente son problemas de decisión: la tarea es solo mostrar la existencia o inexistencia de una coincidencia. Sin embargo, puede haber múltiples coincidencias desde los cuales el subastador puede elegir. A veces las opciones son equivalentes desde la perspectiva de los subastadores;Alternativamente, se puede usar una función de objetivo para encontrar una coincidencia óptima de acuerdo con ese objetivo. Ejemplo 4. (Alternativas de subastador i) Supongamos | A |= 2. Considere una orden para vender una unidad de A1 al precio $ 0.7, una orden para vender una unidad de A2 al precio $ 0.7, una orden para comprar una unidad de A1A2 al precio $ 0.4, una orden para comprar una unidad de A1 ¯a2 a precio $ 0.4, y una orden para comprar una unidad de ¯a1a2 al precio $ 0.4. Los vectores de pago correspondientes son: υ1 = −0.3, −0.3, 0.7, 0.7 υ2 = −0.3, 0.7, −0.3, 0.7 υ3 = 0.6, −0.4, −0.4, −0.4 υ4 = −0.4, 0.6, −0.4, 4, 4,−0.4 υ5 = −0.4, −0.4, 0.6, −0.4 Considere el caso indivisible. El subastador podría optar por aceptar las ofertas 1, 3 y 4 juntas, o el subastador podría elegir aceptar las ofertas 2, 3 y 5 juntas. Ambos constituyen coincidencias y, de hecho, ambos producen pagos idénticos (υAuc = 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1 o $ 0.1 en efectivo) para el subastador.2 Ejemplo 5. (Alternativas de subastador ii) Supongamos | A |= 2. Considere una orden para vender dos unidades de A1 al precio $ 0.6, una orden para comprar una unidad de A1A2 al precio $ 0.3 y una orden para comprar una unidad de A1 ¯A2 al precio $ 0.5. Los vectores de pago correspondientes son: υ1 = −0.4, −0.4, 0.6, 0.6 υ2 = 0.7, −0.3, −0.3, −0.3 υ3 = −0.5, 0.5, −0.5, −0.5 Considere el caso divisible. El subastador podría elegir aceptar una unidad cada una de las tres ofertas, produciendo una recompensa al subastador de $ 0.2 en efectivo (υAuc = 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2). Alternativamente, el subastador podría elegir aceptar 4/3 unidades de BID 1, y una unidad cada una de las ofertas 2 y 3, produciendo una recompensa al subastador de 1/3 unidades de seguridad A1. Ambas opciones constituyen coincidencias (de hecho, aceptar cualquier cantidad de unidades de BID 1 entre 1 y 4/3 puede ser parte de una coincidencia), aunque dependiendo del objetivo de los subastadores, una opción podría preferirse sobre otra. Por ejemplo, si el subastador cree que es muy probable que A1 ocurra, puede preferir aceptar 4/3 unidades de BID 1. 2 Hay muchos criterios posibles para que el subastador decida entre las coincidencias, todas las cuales parecen razonables en algunas circunstancias. Una cantidad natural para maximizar es el volumen de comercio entre los postores;Otra es la utilidad de los subastadores, ya sea con o sin la restricción de arbitraje. Definición 3. (Problema de maximización del comercio) Dado un conjunto de órdenes indivisibles (divisibles) o, elija αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈ [0, 1]) para maximizar x i αiqi, bajo la restricción de que ∀ω, ineΩ AUC ≥ 0. 2 Otra variación razonable es maximizar el porcentaje total de los pedidos llenados, o P i αi, bajo la misma restricción (libre de riesgos) que ∀Ω, υ ω auc ≥ 0. Definición 4. (Problema de maximización de utilidad libre de riesgos de subastador) Permita que los subastadores la probabilidad subjetiva para cada estado Ω sea PR (ω), y permita que la utilidad de los subastadores por dólares y dólares sea u (y). Dado un conjunto de órdenes indivisibles (divisibles) o, elija αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈ [0, 1]) para maximizar x ω∈ω pr (ω) u (υ ω auc), 148 bajo la restricción que∀Ω, υ Ω auc ≥ 0. 2 Definición 5. (Problema de maximización de utilidad estándar del subastador) permita que los subastadores de probabilidad subjetiva para cada estado Ω sean PR (ω), y permita que la utilidad de los subastadores por dólares y dólares sea u (y). Dado un conjunto de órdenes indivisibles (divisibles) o, elija αi ∈ {0, 1} (αi ∈ [0, 1]) para maximizar x ω∈ω pr (ω) u υ ω auc.2 Esta última función objetivo elimina la restricción libre de riesgos (arbitraje). En este caso, el subastador es un fabricante de mercado con creencias sobre la probabilidad de resultados, y el subastador en realidad puede perder dinero son algunos resultados. Aún otras variaciones y otros criterios de optimización parecen razonables, incluido el bienestar social, etc. También parece razonable suponer que el excedente se comparta entre los postores y el subastador, en lugar de retenido únicamente por el subastador. Esto es análogo a elegir un precio de transacción común en una doble subasta (por ejemplo, el punto medio entre los precios de la oferta y la solicitud), en lugar del comprador que paga el precio de la oferta y el vendedor que recibe el precio de Ask, con la diferencia para el subastador. El problema se vuelve más complicado al dividir los valores excedentes, en parte porque son valorados de manera diferente por diferentes agentes. Formular reglas de intercambio razonables y examinar las propiedades de incentivos resultantes parece una vía rica y prometedora para una mayor investigación.4. Algoritmos coincidentes El algoritmo directo para resolver el problema de coincidencia divisible es la programación lineal;Configuramos un programa lineal apropiado en la Sección 5.1. El algoritmo directo para resolver el problema de coincidencia indivisible es la programación entera. Con n eventos, para configurar los programas lineales o enteros apropiados, simplemente escribiendo los vectores de pago de la manera directa requiere el espacio O (2n). Existe cierta esperanza de que los algoritmos especializados que exploten la estructura entre las ofertas puedan funcionar mejor en términos de tiempo promedio y complejidad del espacio. Por ejemplo, en algunos casos se pueden identificar coincidencias utilizando técnicas de reducción lógica, sin escribir los vectores de pago completos. Entonces, una coincidencia entre las siguientes ofertas: • Vender 1 de A1A2 a $ 0.2 • Vender 1 de A1 ¯a2 a $ 0.1 • Compre 1 de A1 a $ 0.4 puede identificarse reduciendo las dos primeras ofertas a una oferta equivalente para vender A1 a $ 0.3 queClaramente coincide con la tercera oferta. Formalizar un algoritmo de reducción lógica para la coincidencia u otros algoritmos que pueden explotar la estructura especial entre las ofertas, es una vía prometedora para el trabajo futuro.5. La complejidad computacional de la coincidencia en esta sección examinamos la complejidad computacional del problema de coincidencia de los subastadores. Aquí N se refiere al tamaño de entrada de problemas que incluye descripciones de todas las órdenes de compra y venta. También suponemos que N limita el número de valores base. Consideramos cuatro casos basados en dos parámetros: 1. Si permitir órdenes divisibles o indivisibles.2. Consideramos dos posibilidades: (a) o (log n) valores base que producen un número polinomial de estados.(b) Un número ilimitado de valores base que producen un número exponencial de estados. Mostramos los siguientes resultados. El problema de correspondencia es 1. Computable en tiempo polinomial para valores base O (log n) con órdenes divisibles.2. CO-NP-Completo para valores ilimitados con órdenes divisibles.3. NP-Complete para valores base O (log n) con pedidos indivisibles.4. Σp 2 Completo para valores ilimitados con órdenes indivisibles.5.1 Pequeño número de valores con pedidos divisibles podemos construir un programa lineal basado en la definición 2. Para cada i, tenemos 0 ≤ αi ≤ 1 y para cada estado Ω en ω tenemos la restricción υ ω auc = x i −αiυ Ω I ≥ 0. Dadas estas restricciones maximizamos x i αi. Un conjunto de órdenes tiene una coincidencia exactamente cuando P i αi> 0. Con o (log n) valores base, tenemos | Ω |Limitado por un polinomio para que podamos resolver este programa lineal en tiempo polinomial. Tenga en cuenta que uno podría argumentar que se debe maximizar una combinación lineal de −υ Ω i s para maximizar el excedente. Sin embargo, este enfoque no encontrará coincidencias que tengan cero excedentes.5.2 Gran número de valores con órdenes divisibles con valores base ilimitados, el programa lineal dado en la Sección 5.1 tiene un número exponencial de ecuaciones de restricciones. Cada restricción es corta para describir y fácilmente computable, dado Ω.149 Sea m ≤ n el número total de pedidos de compra y venta. Por la teoría de la programación lineal, un límite superior en la función objetivo puede ser forzada mediante una colección de restricciones M + 1. Entonces, si no existe una coincidencia, debe existir restricciones M + 1 que obligan a todos los αi a cero. En tiempo polinomial no determinista, podemos adivinar estas restricciones y resolver el programa lineal reducido. Esto muestra que la coincidencia está en CO-NP. Para mostrar la completitud de CO-NP, reducimos el problema de NP-completado de la satisfilidad de la fórmula booleana a la inexistencia de una coincidencia. Deje que los valores base sean las variables de φ y considere la seguridad única φ con un orden de compra de 0.5. Si la fórmula φ es satisfactoria, entonces hay algún estado con el pago 0.5 y ninguna unidad fraccional de la seguridad φ es una coincidencia. Si la fórmula φ no es satisfactoria, entonces cada estado tiene un pago de subastas de 0.5 y una sola unidad de la seguridad φ es una coincidencia. Se podría argumentar que si la fórmula φ no es satisfactoria, entonces ningún comprador completamente racional querría comprar φ por un costo de 0.5. Podemos solucionar este problema agregando valores base auxiliares, A y B, y definiendo dos valores τ = (φ ∧ a) ∨ (a ∧ b) τ = (φ ∧ a) ∨ (a ∧ b) con órdenes de compra separadasde 0.5 en cada uno. Si φ fuera satisfactorio, entonces en el estado correspondiente a la asignación satisfactoria y tanto A como B son verdaderas, τ y τ tienen un pago de subastas de −0.5, por lo que incluso no puede existir ninguna coincidencia divisible. Si φ no fuera satisfactorio, entonces una unidad de cada una sería una coincidencia, ya que en cada estado al menos uno de τ o τ son falsos.5.3 Pequeño número de valores con órdenes indivisibles Este caso se ve fácilmente en NP: solo adivina de manera no determinista un subconjunto de órdenes no vacío y verifica cada estado Ω en Ω que Ω auc = x i∈S −υ ω ≥ 0. Desde | Ω |y | S |están limitados por un polinomio en n, la verificación se puede hacer en tiempo polinomial. Para demostrar que la coincidencia es NP-complete, reducimos la cubierta exacta del problema NPCOMPLETE en 3 conjuntos (X3C) a una coincidencia de valores. La entrada a X3C consiste en un conjunto X y una colección C de subconjuntos de 3 elementos de X. La entrada (x, c) está en x3c si c contiene una cubierta exacta de x, es decir, hay una subcolección c de c tal que cada elemento de x ocurre exactamente en un miembro de c. KARP mostró que X3C es NP-Completo. Supongamos que tenemos una instancia (x, c) con el vector x = {x1 ,..., x3q} y c = {c1 ,..., cm}. Establecimos ω = {e1 ,..., E3Q, R, S} y defina valores etiquetados φ1 ,..., φM, ψ1 ,..., ψQ y τ, como sigue: • La seguridad φi es cierta en el estado r, y es cierto en el estado ek si k no está en CI.• La seguridad ψj es verdadera solo en el estado s.• La seguridad τ es verdadera en cada estado EK pero no R o S.Tenemos órdenes de compra en cada seguridad φi y ψj para 0.5 - 1 8q y una orden de compra en τ para 0.5. Afirmamos que existe una coincidencia si y solo si (x, c) está en x3c. Si (x, c) está en x3c, sea C la subcolección que cubre cada elemento de x exactamente una vez. Reclamamos la colección que consiste en φi para cada CI en C, cada ψj y τ tiene una coincidencia. En cada estado EK tenemos un pago de subastas de (.5 - 1 8q) + (q - 1) ( -. 5 - 1 8q) + Q (.5 - 1 8q) - .5 = .5 - 2Q 1 8Q= .25 ≥ 0. En los estados R y S, los pagos de los subastadores son −Q (.5 + 1 8q) + −q ( -. 5 + 1 8q) + .5 = −5 - 2q 1 8q = .25 ≥ 0. Supongamos ahora que (x, c) no está en x3c pero hay una coincidencia. Considere el número Q del φi en esa coincidencia y Q el número de ψj en la coincidencia. Dado que una coincidencia requiere un subconjunto no vacío de las órdenes y τ por sí mismo no es una coincidencia, tenemos Q + Q> 0. Tenemos tres casos.Q> P: En el estado R, el pago de los subastadores es −Q (.5 + 1 8q) - Q ( -. 5 + 1 8q) + .5 ≤ - (Q + Q) 1 8q <0. Q> Q:En el estado s, el pago de los subastadores es −q (.5 + 1 8q) - q (−.5 + 1 8q) + .5 ≤ - (q + q) 1 8q <0. q ≤ q ≤ q: Considere elConjunto C que consiste en el CI donde φi está en la coincidencia. Debe haber algún estado que EK no en ninguno de los CI o C sería una cubierta exacta. El pago de los subastadores en EK es como máximo − Q (.5 + 1 8q) - Q (−.5 + 1 8q) ≤ - (Q + Q) 1 8q <0. 5.4 Gran número de valores con órdenes indivisibles la clase σp2 es el segundo nivel de la jerarquía de tiempo polinomial. Un lenguaje l está en σp 2 si existe una P polinomial y un conjunto A en P de tal manera que x está en L si y solo si hay una y con | y |= p (| x |) tal que para todas las z, con | z |= p (| x |), (x, y, z) está en A. La clase σp 2 contiene NP y Conp. A menos que la jerarquía de tiempo polinomial se derrumbe (que se considera poco probable), un problema completo para σp 2 no está contenido en NP o CO-NP. Mostraremos que calcular una coincidencia es σp 2 completa, y sigue siendo incluso para tipos de valores bastante restringidos, y por lo tanto, no es (probablemente) ni en NP o CO-NP. Si bien puede parecer que ser NP-Completo o CO-NP-Completo es bastante difícil, hay más consecuencias prácticas de estar fuera de NP y CO-NP. Si el problema de coincidencia estuviera en NP, uno podría usar heurísticas para buscar y verificar una coincidencia si existe;Incluso si tales heurísticas fallan en el peor de los casos, pueden tener éxito para la mayoría de los ejemplos en la práctica. Del mismo modo, si el problema de correspondencia estuviera en CO-NP, uno podría esperar al menos descartar heurísticamente la posibilidad de coincidir. Pero para problemas fuera de NP o CO-NP, no hay un marco para verificar que una respuesta derivada heurísticamente sea correcta. Menos formalmente, para los problemas de NP (o CO-NP), debes tener suerte;Para los problemas de σp 2 completos, ni siquiera puede saber si ha tenido suerte.150 Observamos que la existencia de una coincidencia está en σp 2: usamos y para elegir un subconjunto de los órdenes y z para representar un estado ω con (x, y, z) en A si el conjunto de órdenes tiene un total no positivoRecompensa de subastas en el estado Ω. Probamos un teorema más fuerte que implica que la coincidencia está en σp 2. Sea S1 ,..., Sn, es un conjunto de valores, donde cada SI SI ha costado CI y paga PI cada vez que se satisfaga la fórmula CI. El problema 0-1 coincidencia pregunta si uno puede, al aceptar 0 o 1 de cada seguridad, garantizar el peor pago de la casos estrictamente más grande que el costo total. El problema de coincidencia 0-1 es σp 2-completado. Además, el problema sigue siendo σp 2 complete en los siguientes dos casos especiales: 1. Para todos los i, CI es una conjunción de 3 eventos base (o sus negaciones), PI = 1 y CI = CJ para todos I y J.2. Para todos los i, CI es una conjunción de en la mayoría de los 2 valores base (o sus negaciones). Estos resultados de dureza se mantienen incluso si hay una promesa de que ningún subconjunto de los valores garantiza un peor pago de la peor de los casos idéntico a su costo. Para probar el teorema 2, reducimos del problema estándar σp 2 que llamamos T∃∀BF. Dada una fórmula booleana φ con variables x1 ,..., xn e y1 ,..., yn es la siguiente fórmula completamente cuantificada verdadera ∃x1...∃xn∀y1...∀yn φ (x1, ..., xn, y1, ..., yn)? El problema sigue siendo σp 2 complete cuando φ (x1, ..., xn, y1, ..., yn) está restringido a una disyunción de conjunciones de la mayoría de las 3 variables (o sus negaciones), por ejemplo, φ (x1, ..., xn, y1, ..., yn) = (x1 ∧ ¯x3 ∧ y2) ∨ (x2 ∧ y3 ∧ y7) ∨ · · ·. Esta forma, sin el límite en el tamaño de la conjunción, se conoce como forma normal disyuntiva (DNF);La restricción a las conjunciones de 3 variables es 3-DNF. Reducimos T∃∀BF a encontrar una coincidencia. Para la reducción más simple, consideramos el problema de correspondencia en el que uno tiene un conjunto de valores de flecha-debreu cuyos eventos de pago son conjunciones de los valores base o sus negaciones. El subastador tiene la opción de aceptar 0 o 1 de cada uno de los valores dados. Primero nos reducimos al caso donde los eventos de pago son conjunciones de muchos eventos base arbitrariamente (o sus negaciones). Mediante un truco estándar, podemos reducir la cantidad de eventos base en cada conjunción a 3, y con un ligero giro incluso podemos garantizar que todos los valores tengan el mismo precio, así como la misma recompensa. Finalmente, mostramos que el problema sigue siendo difícil, incluso si solo se permiten conjunciones de 2 variables, aunque con valores que se desvían ligeramente de los valores de flecha-debreu en el sentido de que pueden tener pagos no unitarios variables.5.4.1 La reducción básica antes de describir los valores, damos cierta intuición. El T∃∀BFProblem puede verse como un juego entre un selector y un adversario. El selector establece las variables Xi, y luego el adversario establece las variables Yi para falsificar la fórmula φ. Podemos ver el problema 0-1 de emparejamiento como uno en el que el subastador es un comprador que compra valores correspondientes a disyunciones de los eventos base, y luego el adversario establece los valores de los eventos base para minimizar el pago de los valores. Construimos nuestros valores para que la estrategia de compra óptima sea comprar n valores caros junto con un conjunto de valores baratos, de costo insignificante (para algunos casos podemos modificar la construcción para que todos los valores tengan el mismo costo). El costo total de los valores será de poco menos de 1, y cada seguridad vale la pena 1, por lo que el adversario debe asegurarse de que ninguno de los valores valga la pena. Cada seguridad costosa obliga al adversario a establecer alguna variable, Xi a un valor particular para evitar que la seguridad pague;Esto corresponde a establecer las variables XI en el juego original. Los valores baratos son tales que evitar que cada uno de estos valores pague es equivalente a falsificar φ en el juego original. Entre las dificultades técnicas que enfrentamos es cómo evitar que el comprador compre valores en conflicto, por ejemplo, uno que fuerza xi = 0 y el otro que fuerza xi = 1, lo que permite un arbitraje trivial. En segundo lugar, para nuestro análisis debemos asegurarnos de que un operador no pueda gastar más para obtener más, por ejemplo, gastando 1.5 para un conjunto de valores con la propiedad que al menos 2 valores valen bajo todos los eventos posibles. Para cada una de las variables {xi}, {yi} en φ, agregamos una seguridad base correspondiente (con las mismas etiquetas). Para cada variable existencial Xi agregamos valores base adicionales, Ni y Zi. También incluimos una seguridad base Q. En nuestra construcción básica, cada costosa seguridad cuesta C y cada costos de seguridad baratos;Todos los valores dan sus frutos 1. Requerimos que CN+ (| Valores baratos |) <1 y C (n+ 1)> 1. Es decir, uno puede comprar n valores caros y todos los valores baratos por menos de 1, pero no puede comprar valores n + 1 caros por menos de 1. A veces nos referimos a una seguridad por su cláusula de pago. Observación: Podemos pensar libremente como 0. Sin embargo, esto permitiría a uno comprar una seguridad por nada que no pague (en el peor de los casos) nada. Al hacer> 0, podemos mostrar que es difícil distinguir las carteras que garantizan una ganancia positiva de aquellos que arriesgan una pérdida positiva. La configuración> 0 también nos permitirá mostrar los resultados de la dureza para el caso donde todos los valores tienen el mismo costo. Para 1 ≤ i ≤ n, tenemos dos valores caros con cláusulas de pago (¯xi ∧q) y (¯ni ∧q) y dos valores baratos con cláusulas de pago (xi ∧ ¯zi) y (ni ∧ ¯zi). Para cada cláusula c ∈ φ, convertimos cada variable negada ¯xi en Ni y agregamos la conjunción Z1 ∧ · · · ∧ Zn. Por lo tanto, para una cláusula c = (x2 ∧ ¯x7 ∧ ¯y5) construimos un SC de seguridad barato, con cláusula de pago (Z1 ∧ · · · ∧ Zn ∧ x2 ∧ n7 ∧ ¯y5). Finalmente, tenemos una seguridad barata con la cláusula de pago (¯q). Ahora argumentamos que existe una coincidencia IFF ∃X1...∃xn∀y1...∀yn φ (x1, ..., xn, y1, ..., yn). Hacemos esto limitando sucesivamente al comprador y al adversario, eliminando los comportamientos que harían que el otro jugador gane. Las estrategias razonables resultantes corresponden exactamente a la versión del juego de T∃∀BF. Primero, observe que si el adversario establece todos los valores base en falso (0), solo la seguridad (¯Q) valdrá la pena.151 Por lo tanto, ningún comprador puede comprar más de n valores caros y garantizar una ganancia. El problema es, por lo tanto, si uno puede comprar n valores caros y todos los valores baratos, de modo que para cualquier configuración de los eventos base al menos una seguridad valdrá la pena. Claramente, el adversario debe hacer que Q Hold, o la seguridad (¯Q) valdrá la pena. A continuación, afirmamos que para cada i, 1 ≤ i ≤ i, el subastador debe comprar al menos uno de los valores (¯xi ∧ q) y (¯ni ∧ q). Esto se deduce del hecho de que si el adversario establece que Xi, Ni y Zi sean falsos, y cualquier otro evento base es verdadero, entonces solo los valores (¯xi ∧ q) y (¯ni ∧ q) val las cancelaciones. Como ningún subastador puede comprar más de n valores caros, por lo tanto, debe comprar exactamente uno de (¯xi ∧ q) o (¯ni ∧ q), para cada i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n.Para el resto del análisis, suponemos que el subastador sigue esta restricción. Supongamos que el comprador compra (¯xi ∧q). Entonces el adversario debe establecer que Xi sea verdadero (ya que debe establecer que Q sea verdadero), o la seguridad valdrá la pena. Luego debe establecer que Zi sea verdadero o (xi∧¯zi) valdrá la pena. Dado que el comprador no compra (¯ni ∧ q) (por la restricción anterior), y todos los demás valores pagan lo mismo o menos cuando Ni se hace falso, podemos suponer sin pérdida de generalidad que el adversario establece que Ni es falso. Del mismo modo, si el comprador compra (¯ni ∧ q), entonces el adversario debe establecer que Ni y Zi sean verdaderos, y podemos suponer sin pérdida de generalidad que el adversario establece que XI es falso. Tenga en cuenta que el adversario debe en todos los casos establecer que cada evento Zi sea verdadero. Resumiendo el argumento anterior, existe una correspondencia exacta entre las estrategias racionales del comprador y la configuración para las variables XI forzadas en el adversario. Además, el adversario también está limitado para establecer las variables Q, Z1 ,..., Zn para ser verdadero, y sin pérdida de generalidad se puede suponer que establece ni = ¯xi. Bajo estas restricciones, aquellos valores que no corresponden a cláusulas en φ están garantizadas que no valgan la pena. El adversario también decide el valor del Y1 ,..., ym eventos base. Recuerde que para cada cláusula c ∈ φ hay una seguridad correspondiente SC. Dado que Zi es verdadero y ni = ¯xi (sin pérdida de generalidad), se deduce de la construcción de SC que la configuración del YIS hace que SC pague si satisface C. Esto establece la reducción de T∃∀BF aEl problema de correspondencia, cuando los valores se limitan a ser una conjunción de muchos eventos base polinómicos o sus negaciones.5.4.2 Reducción de conjunciones de 3 variables Existen métodos estándar para reducir las fórmulas DNF a las fórmulas 3-DNF, que son trivialmente modificables para nuestro marco de valores;Incluimos la reducción de integridad. Dada una seguridad, cuya cláusula de pago es c = (v1 ∧ v2 ∧ · · · ∧ ∧ vk) (las negaciones variables son irrelevantes para esta discusión), Costo C y Payoff P, introducir una nueva variable auxiliar, W y reemplazar la seguridad conDos valores, S1 y S2, con cláusulas de pago, C1 = (V1 ∧ V2 ∧ W) y C2 = (¯W ∧ V3 ∧ · · · · ∧ VK). Los valores tienen un pago P, y sus costos pueden ser cualquier valor positivo que suma a c.Tenga en cuenta que, a lo sumo, uno de los valores puede dar sus frutos a la vez. Si solo se compra una seguridad, entonces el adversario siempre puede establecer W para que no valga la pena;Por lo tanto, el subastador comprará ambos o ninguno de los dos, por un costo total de C (aquí usamos el hecho de que uno solo puede comprar 0 o 1 acciones de cada seguridad). Luego, se puede verificar que, dada la capacidad de establecer W arbitrariamente, el adversario puede hacer que C esté insatisfecho si puede hacer que tanto C1 como C2 estén insatisfechos. Por lo tanto, poseer una parte de cada uno de S1 y S2 es equivalente a poseer una parte de S. Tenga en cuenta que C1 tiene tres variables y C2 tiene variables K -1. Al aplicar la transformación sucesivamente, uno obtiene un conjunto equivalente de valores, de tamaño polinomial, cuyas cláusulas de pago tienen como máximo 3 variables. Observamos que en la construcción básica, todas las cláusulas con más de 3 variables están asociadas con valores baratos (costo). En lugar de subdividir los costos, simplemente podemos hacer que todos los valores resultantes tengan costos;Las restricciones en C y deben reflejar el nuevo y mayor número de valores baratos. Uno puede asegurarse de que todas las cláusulas de pago tengan exactamente 3 variables, con una construcción similar. Una seguridad con costo C, recompensa P y cláusula de definición (x ∧ y) puede ser reemplazada por valores S1 y S2 con costo C/2, pago P y definición de cláusulas (x∧y∧w) y (x∧y∧ ¯w), donde W es una nueva variable auxiliar. Esencialmente, el mismo análisis que se indica anteriormente se aplica a este caso. El caso de las cláusulas de pago de una sola variable se maneja mediante dos aplicaciones de esta técnica.5.4.3 Reducción de valores de costo equi estableciendo C y, de manera apropiada, se puede garantizar que en la reducción básica cada seguridad cuesta un entero múltiple polinomialmente limitado múltiple de;Llame a esta relación r.Ahora mostramos cómo reducir este caso al caso donde cuesta cada seguridad. Recuerde que los valores caros tienen cláusulas de pago (¯xi ∧ q) o (¯ni ∧ q). Suponga que la seguridad tiene una cláusula de pago (¯xi ∧ q) (el otro caso se maneja de manera idéntica). Reemplace S con Security S, con la cláusula de pago (¯xi ∧ Q ∧ W1) (W1, ..., Wr - 1 son variables auxiliares; se eligen variables nuevas para cada cláusula), y también S1 ,..., SR - 1, con cláusulas de pago (¯w1 ∧ w2), (¯w2 ∧ w3) ,..., (¯wr - 2 ∧ wr - 1), y (¯wr - 1 ∧ ¯w1). Claramente, comprar ninguno de los nuevos valores es equivalente a no comprar la seguridad original. Mostramos que comprar todos los nuevos valores es equivalente a comprar la seguridad original, y que comprar un subconjunto adecuado y no vacío de los valores es irracional. Primero observamos que si el comprador compra valores S1 ,..., SR - 1, entonces el adversario debe establecer W1 para que sea verdadero, o uno de los valores dará sus frutos. Para ver esto, tenga en cuenta que si Wi se establece en falso, entonces (¯wi ∧wi+1) será verdadero a menos que wi+1 esté configurado en falso;Por lo tanto, establecer W1 en falso obliga al adversario a establecer WR - 1 en falso, lo que hace que la cláusula final sea verdadera. Habiendo establecido W1 verdadero, el adversario puede establecer W2 ,..., wr - 1 a falso, asegurando que ninguno de los valores S1 ,..., SR - 1 paga. Si wi es verdadero, entonces (¯xi ∧ q ∧ w1) es equivalente a (¯xi ∧ q). Por lo tanto, comprar todos los valores de reemplazo para cada uno es equivalente a comprar la seguridad original para r.Queda por demostrar que comprar un subconjunto adecuado y no vacío de los valores es irracional. Si uno no compra S, entonces el adversario puede establecer las variables W para que ninguna de S1 ,..., SR - 1 valdrá la pena;Cualquier dinero gastado en estos valores se desperdicia. Si uno no compra SR - 1, el adversario puede establecer todo W en falso, en cuyo caso ninguna de las nuevas cláusulas valdrá la pena, independientemente del valor de Xi y Q. Del mismo modo, si uno 152 no compra si, para 1 ≤ i ≤ r −2, el adversario puede establecer wi+1 para ser verdadXi y Q. Por lo tanto, comprar un subconjunto adecuado de estos valores no aumentará la recompensa. Observamos que esta reducción se puede combinar trivialmente con la reducción que garantiza que todas las cláusulas definitorias tengan 3 o menos variables. Con un argumento ligeramente más desordenado, todas las cláusulas definitorias se pueden configurar para tener exactamente 3 variables.5.4.4 Reducción de cláusulas de la mayoría de las 2 variables Si permitimos que los valores tengan pagos y precios variables, podemos reducir al caso donde cada cláusula de pago de seguridad es una conjunción de en la mayoría de las 2 variables o sus negaciones. Dado una seguridad con la cláusula de pago (x ∧ y ∧ z), costo C y pago 1, presentamos nuevas variables auxiliares, W1, W2 y W3 (se utilizan nuevas variables para cada cláusula) y reemplazamos S con los siguientes valores: •Valores S1, S2 y S3, cada uno con costo C/3 y Payoff 1, con respectivas cláusulas de pago (X ∧ W1), (y ∧ W2) y (Z ∧ W3).• Valores S1 ,..., S6, cada uno con costo 4 y recompensa 24 - 2, con cláusulas de pago, (W1 ∧ W2) (W1 ∧ W3) (W2 ∧ W3) (¯w1 ∧ ¯w2) (¯w1 ∧ ¯w3) (¯w2 ∧ ∧¯w3) Aquí, 2 es una pequeña cantidad positiva, descrita más adelante. Por un simple análisis de casos, tenemos lo siguiente. Para cualquier I, existe una configuración de W1, W2 un W3 tal que de los valores S solo SI vale la pena.2. Para cualquier configuración de W1, W2 y W3, al menos uno de los valores S valdrá la pena.3. Si W1, W2 y W3 son todos falsos, todos los valores S darán sus frutos.4. Establecer uno de W1, W2 o W3 para que sea verdadero, y los demás para ser 0, causará exactamente uno de los valores de S Según la observación 1, no tiene sentido comprar un subconjunto apropiado no vacío de los valores S: el adversario puede garantizar que ninguno de los valores comprados valga la pena, e incluso si todos los valores de S dan sus frutos, no será suficiente para recuperarEl costo de comprar una sola seguridad. Mediante la observación 2, si uno compra todos los valores S, se garantiza que casi hará una inversión (excepto 2), en cuyo caso por las observaciones 3 y 4, la estrategia óptima de los adversarios es hacer exactamente uno de W1, W2 ow3 verdadero. Establecimos C, y 2 para que CN + (| Valores baratos |) + 2 (| Clauses |) <1. Por lo tanto, las pérdidas acumuladas de 2 nunca pueden deletrear la diferencia entre obtener un beneficio garantizado y no obtener ganancias en absoluto. Tenga en cuenta también que al hacer 2 positivos, evitamos la existencia de estrategias de compra de incluso siquiera incluso en las que el comprador solo compra los valores. Resumiendo el argumento anterior, podemos suponer sin pérdida de generalidad que el comprador compra todos los valores S (para todas las cláusulas), y que para cada cláusula el adversario establece exactamente una de esas variables auxiliares W1, W2 o W3 como verdaderas. Para el resto de la discusión, suponemos que los jugadores siguen estas limitaciones. A continuación, afirmamos que un comprador racional comprará todo S1, S2 o S3, o ninguno de ellos. Si el comprador no compra S1, entonces si el adversario hace que W1 sea verdadero y W2 y W3 falsos, ni S2 ni S3 darán sus frutos, independientemente de cómo el adversario establezca X, Y y Z. Por lo tanto, no tiene sentido comprar S2 o S3 si uno no compra S1. Aplicar el mismo argumento a S2 y S3 establece el reclamo. Claramente, la compra de ninguno de S1, S2 y S3 tiene, hasta 2 factores insignificantes, el mismo precio/comportamiento de pago que no comprar S. A continuación argumentamos que, sujeto a las limitaciones establecidas en los comportamientos de los jugadores, comprando todo S1,S2 y S3 tienen el mismo precio/comportamiento de pago (nuevamente ignorando 2 factores) que las compras S, independientemente de cómo el adversario establezca X, Y y Z. Primero, en ambos casos, el costo es c.Si el adversario hace que X, Y y Z sean verdaderos, entonces S paga 1, y (suponiendo que exactamente uno de W1, W2 y W3 sea verdadero), exactamente uno de S1, S2 o S3 pagará 1. Si x es falso, entonces S no paga sus valiosas, y el adversario puede establecer W1 verdadero (y W2 y W3 falso), asegurando que ninguno de S1, S2 y S3 valga la pena. El mismo argumento se mantiene si Y o Z son falsos.6. Casos manejables La pregunta lógica a la luz de estos resultados de complejidad es si las restricciones más graves y más severas en el espacio de los valores pueden permitir algoritmos de correspondencia manejables. Aunque no hemos explorado sistemáticamente las posibilidades, ciertamente existe el potencial de casos útiles útiles. Supongamos, por ejemplo, que las ofertas se limitan a cantidades unitarias de valores de las siguientes dos formas: 1. Disyunciones de eventos positivos: A1 ∨ · · · ∨ AK.2. Sea P el precio ofrecido para una disyunción A1 ∨ · · · ∨ AK, y Qi el precio máximo ofrecido para los respectivos disyuntamientos negados. Esta oferta de disyunción es parte de una coincidencia IFF P +P I Qi ≥ k.Evaluar si esta condición está satisfecha con un subconjunto de ofertas es bastante sencillo. Aunque este ejemplo está artificial, su aplicación no es del todo inverosímil. Por ejemplo, las disjunciones pueden corresponder a los clientes de seguros, que desean un contrato de seguro para cubrir todas las posibles causas de su pérdida de activos. Los valores atómicos son vendidos por aseguradoras, cada uno de los cuales se especializa en una forma diferente de causa de desastre.7. Conclusiones y direcciones futuras Hemos analizado la complejidad computacional de la coincidencia de valores basados en fórmulas lógicas. Existen muchas vías posibles para el trabajo futuro, incluido 1. Análisis del problema de optimización de los agentes: • Cómo elegir cantidades y ofertar/pedir precios para una colección de valores para maximizar la utilidad esperada, tanto para funciones de utilidad lineales como no lineales.153 • Cómo elegir valores;Es decir, decidir qué colección de fórmulas booleanas ofrecer al comercio, sujeto a limitaciones o sanciones sobre el número o complejidad de las ofertas.• ¿Cómo tomar las decisiones anteriores en un juego teóricamente sólido, teniendo en cuenta las opciones de otros comerciantes, su razonamiento sobre otros comerciantes, etc. 2. Aunque la coincidencia es probablemente intratable, ¿hay buenas heurísticas que logren coincidencias en muchos casos o se aproximen a una coincidencia?3. Explorar las reglas de intercambio para dividir el excedente y las propiedades de incentivos de los mecanismos resultantes.4. Podemos considerar que un mercado está en equilibrio computacional si ningún jugador limitados computacionalmente puede encontrar una estrategia que aumente la utilidad. Con pocas excepciones [3, 22], se sabe poco sobre los equilibrios computacionales. Una pregunta natural es determinar si un mercado puede lograr un equilibrio computacional que no sea un verdadero equilibrio, y bajo qué circunstancias puede ocurrir esto.

Pennock ∗ Overture Services, Inc., 3rd floor 74 N. Pasadena Ave Pasadena, CA 91103 Michael P. Wellman University of Michigan AI Laboratory 1101 Beal Avenue Ann Arbor, MI 48109 ABSTRACT We develop a framework for trading in compound securities: financial instruments that pay off contingent on the outcomes of arbitrary statements in propositional logic.",
        "Buying or selling securities-which can be thought of as betting on or against a particular future outcome-allows agents both to hedge risk and to profit (in expectation) on subjective predictions.",
        "A compound securities market allows agents to place bets on arbitrary boolean combinations of events, enabling them to more closely achieve their optimal risk exposure, and enabling the market as a whole to more closely achieve the social optimum.",
        "The tradeoff for allowing such expressivity is in the complexity of the agents and auctioneers optimization problems.",
        "We develop and motivate the concept of a compound securities market, presenting the framework through a series of formal definitions and examples.",
        "We then analyze in detail the auctioneers matching problem.",
        "We show that, with n events, the matching problem is co-NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
        "We show that the latter hardness result holds even under severe language restrictions on bids.",
        "With log n events, the problem is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case.",
        "We briefly discuss matching algorithms and tractable special cases.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors F.2.2 [Theory of Computation]: Analysis of Algorithms and Problem Complexity-Nonnumerical Algorithms and Problems; J.4 [Computer Applications]: Social and Behavioral Sciences-Economics General Terms Algorithms, Economics, Theory. 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Securities markets effectively allow traders to place bets on the outcomes of uncertain future propositions.",
        "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like CBOE [17], futures markets like CME [30], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [11, 12], sports betting markets [7, 13, 32], horse racing markets [33], idea futures markets [16], decision markets [14] and even market games [4, 24, 25].",
        "The economic value of securities markets is two-fold.",
        "First, they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
        "For example, the owner of a stock might buy a put option (the right to sell the stock at a particular price) in order to insure against a stock downturn.",
        "Or the owner of a house may purchase an insurance contract to hedge against unforeseen damage to the house.",
        "Second, securities markets allow traders to speculate, or to obtain a subjective expected profit when market prices do not reflect their assessment of the likelihood of future outcomes.",
        "For example, a trader might buy a call option if he believes that the likelihood is high that the price of the underlying stock will go up, regardless of risk exposure to changes in the stock price.",
        "Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].",
        "Real securities markets have complex payoff structures with various triggers.",
        "However, these can all be modeled as collections of more basic or atomic Arrow-Debreu securities [1, 8, 20].",
        "One unit of one Arrow-Debreu security pays off one dollar if and only if (iff) a corresponding binary event occurs; it pays nothing if the event does not occur.",
        "So, for example, one unit of a security denoted Acme100 might pay $1 iff Acmes stock is above $100 on January 4, 2004.",
        "An Acme stock option as it would be defined on a finan144 cial exchange can be though of as a portfolio of such atomic securities.1 In this paper, we develop and analyze a framework for trading in compound securities markets with payoffs contingent on arbitrary logical combinations of events, including conditionals.",
        "For example, given binary events A, B, and C, one trader might bid to buy three units of a security denoted A ∧ ¯B ∨ C that pays off $1 iff the compound event A ∧ ¯B ∨ C occurs for thirty cents each.",
        "Another trader may bid to sell six units of a security A|C that pays off $1 iff A occurs for fifty-five cents each, conditional on event C occurring, meaning that the transaction is revoked if C does not occur (i.e., no payoff is given and the price of the security is refunded) [5].",
        "Bids may also be divisible, meaning that bidders are willing to accept less than the requested quantity, or indivisible, meaning that bids must be fulfilled either completely or not at all.",
        "Given a set of such bids, the auctioneer faces a complex matching problem to decide which bids are accepted for how many units at what price.",
        "Typically, the auctioneer seeks to take on no risk of its own, only matching up agreeable trades among the bidders, but we also consider alternative formulations where the auctioneer acts as a market maker willing to accept some risk.",
        "We examine the computational complexity of the auctioneers matching problem.",
        "Let the length of the description of all the available securities be O(n).",
        "With n events, the matching problem is co-NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
        "This Σp 2-complete hardness holds even when the bidding language is significantly restricted.",
        "With log n events, the problem is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case.",
        "Section 2 presents some necessary background information, motivation, and related work.",
        "Section 3 formally describes our framework for compound securities, and defines the auctioneers matching problem.",
        "Section 4 briefly discusses natural algorithms for solving the matching problem.",
        "Section 5 proves our central computational complexity results.",
        "Section 6 discusses the possibility of tractable special cases.",
        "Section 7 concludes with a summary and some ideas of future directions. 2.",
        "PRELIMINARIES 2.1 Background and notation Imagine a world where there are only two future uncertain events of any consequence: (1) the event that ones house is struck by lightning by December 31, 2003, denoted struck, and (2) the event that Acmes stock price goes above $100 by January 4, 2004, denoted acme100.",
        "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",
        "Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.",
        "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
        "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
        "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
        "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
        "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
        "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
        "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
        "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
        "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
        "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
        "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
        "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
        "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
        "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
        "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
        "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
        "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
        "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
        "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
        "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
        "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
        "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
        "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
        "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
        "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
        "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",
        "They show that, if all agents risk-neutral independencies agree with the independencies encoded in the market structure, then the market is operationally complete.",
        "For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.",
        "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
        "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
        "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
        "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
        "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
        "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
        "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
        "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
        "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",
        "Compound securities differ from combinatorial auctions in concept and complexity.",
        "Compound securities allow bidders to construct an arbitrary bet on any of the 22n possible compound events expressible as logical functions of the n base events, conditional on any other of the 22n compound events.",
        "Agents optimize based on their own subjective probabilities and risk attitude (and in general, their beliefs about other agents beliefs and utilities, ad infinitum).",
        "The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.",
        "Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.",
        "Typically, 3 Specifically, one unit of each pays off $2 iff both A and B occur, $1 iff A or B occurs (but not both), and $0 otherwise. uncertainty-and thus risk-is not considered.",
        "The central auctioneer problem is to maximize social welfare.",
        "Also note that the problems lie in different complexity classes.",
        "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
        "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
        "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
        "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
        "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
        "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",
        "Hanson [15] develops a market mechanism called a market scoring rule that is especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
        "The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.",
        "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
        "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
        "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
        "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.",
        "The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded.",
        "Though Hanson offers some initial suggestions, several open problems remain, including efficient methods for representing and updating the joint distribution and recording traders positions and portfolios, without resorting to exponential time and space algorithms.",
        "Fagin, Halpern, and Megiddo [9] give a sound and complete axiomatization for deciding whether sets of probabilistic inequalities are consistent.",
        "Bids for compound securities can be thought of as expressions of probabilistic inequalities: for example, a bid to buy A ∧ B at price 0.3 is a statement that the probability of A ∧ B is greater than 0.3.",
        "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
        "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",
        "We address these issues below. 146 3.",
        "FRAMEWORK FOR TRADING IN COMPOUND SECURITIES 3.1 High-level description Common knowledge among agents is the set of events A.",
        "There are no predefined securities.",
        "Instead, agents offer to buy or sell securities of their own design that pay off contingent on logical combinations of events and event negations.",
        "Combination operators may include conjunctions, disjunctions, and conditionals.",
        "For all practical purposes, it is impossible for agents to trade in enough securities (2n ) to form a complete market, so agents must devise their best tradeoff between the number and complexity of their bids, and the extent to which their risks are hedged and desirable bets are placed.",
        "In its most general form, the problem is game-theoretic in nature, since what an agent should offer depends on what it believes other agents will accept.",
        "At the other end of the spectrum, a simplified version of the problem is to optimize bids only on currently available securities at current prices.",
        "In between these two formulations are other possible interesting optimization problems.",
        "Approximation algorithms might also be pursued.",
        "The auctioneer faces a nontrivial problem of matching buy and sell orders to maximize surplus (the cash and securities left over after accepted bids are fulfilled).",
        "For example, offers to sell A1A2 at $0.2 and A1 ¯A2 at $0.1 can match with an offer to buy A1 at $0.4, with surplus $0.1.",
        "Or an offer to sell A1 at $0.3 can match with an offer to buy A1A2 at $0.4, with surplus $0.1 in cash and A1 ¯A2 in securities.",
        "In general, a single security might qualify for multiple matches, but only one can be transacted.",
        "So the auctioneer must find the optimal set of matches that maximizes surplus, which could be measured in a number of ways.",
        "Again, approximation algorithms might be considered.",
        "In another formulation, the auctioneer functions as a market maker willing to take on a certain amount of risk.",
        "Informally, our motivation is to provide a mechanism that allows a very high degree of expressivity in placing hedges and bets, and is also capable of approximating the optimal (complete-market) allocation of risk, trading off the number and complexity of securities and transactions needed. 3.2 Formal description 3.2.1 Securities We use φ and ψ to denote arbitrary boolean formulas, or logical combinations of events in A.",
        "We denote securities φ|ψ .",
        "Securities pay off $1 if and only if (iff) φ and ψ are true, pay off $0 iff φ is false and ψ is true, and are canceled (i.e., any price paid is refunded) iff ψ is false.",
        "We define T ≡ Ω to be the event true and F ≡ ∅ to be the event false.",
        "We abbreviate φ|T as φ . 3.2.2 Orders Agents place orders, denoted o, of the form q units of φ|ψ at price p per unit, where q > 0 implies a buy order and q < 0 implies a sell order.",
        "We assume agents submitting buy (sell) orders will accept any price p∗ ≤ p (p∗ ≥ p).",
        "We distinguish between divisible and indivisible orders.",
        "Agents submitting divisible orders will accept any quantity αq where 0 < α ≤ 1.",
        "Agents submitting indivisible orders will accept only exactly q units, or none at all.",
        "We believe that, given the nature of what is being traded (state-contingent dollars), most agents will be content to trade using divisible orders.",
        "Every order o can be translated into a payoff vector Υ across all states ω ∈ Ω.",
        "The payoff Υ ω in state ω is q · 1ω∈ψ(1ω∈φ − p), where 1ω∈E equals 1 iff ω ∈ E and zero otherwise.",
        "Recall that the 2n states correspond to the 2n possible combinations of event outcomes.",
        "We index multiple orders with subscripts (e.g., oi and Υi).",
        "Let the set of all orders be O and the set of all corresponding payoff vectors be P. Example 1. (Translating orders into payoff vectors) Suppose that |A| = 3.",
        "Consider an order to buy two units of A2 ∨ A3|A1 at price $0.8.",
        "The corresponding payoff vector is: Υ = Υ A1A2A3 , Υ A1A2 ¯A3 , Υ A1 ¯A2A3 , . . . , Υ ¯A1 ¯A2 ¯A3 = 2 · 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, −0.8, 0, 0, 0, 0 2 3.2.3 The matching problem The auctioneers task, called the matching problem, is to determine which orders to accept among all orders o ∈ O.",
        "Let αi be the fraction of order oi accepted by the auctioneer (in the indivisible case, αi must be either 0 or 1; in the divisible case, αi can range from 0 to 1).",

        "Similarly, if the buyer buys (¯ni ∧ Q), then the adversary must set ni and zi to be true, and we can assume without loss of generality that the adversary sets xi to be false.",
        "Note that the adversary must in all cases set each zi event to be true.",
        "Summarizing the preceding argument, there is an exact correspondence between the rational strategies of the buyer and settings for the xi variables forced on the adversary.",
        "Furthermore, the adversary is also constrained to set the variables Q, z1, . . . , zn to be true, and without loss of generality may be assumed to set ni = ¯xi.",
        "Under these constraints, those securities not corresponding to clauses in φ are guaranteed to not pay off.",
        "The adversary also decides the value of the y1, . . . , ym base events.",
        "Recall that for each clause C ∈ φ there is a corresponding security SC.",
        "Given that zi is true and ni = ¯xi (without loss of generality), it follows from the construction of SC that the setting of the yis causes SC to pay off iff it satisfies C. This establishes the reduction from T∃∀BF to the matching problem, when the securities are constrained to be a conjunction of polynomially many base events or their negations. 5.4.2 Reducing to 3-variable conjunctions There are standard methods for reducing DNF formulae to 3-DNF formulae, which are trivially modifiable to our securities framework; we include the reduction for completeness.",
        "Given a security S whose payoff clause is C = (v1 ∧ v2 ∧ · · · ∧ vk) (variable negations are irrelevant to this discussion), cost c and payoff p, introduce a new auxiliary variable, w, and replace the security with two securities, S1 and S2, with payoff clauses, C1 = (v1 ∧ v2 ∧ w) and C2 = ( ¯w ∧ v3 ∧ · · · ∧ vk).",
        "The securities both have payoff p, and their costs can be any positive values that sum to c. Note that at most one of the securities can pay off at a time.",
        "If only one security is bought, then the adversary can always set w so that it wont pay off; hence the auctioneer will buy either both or neither, for a total cost of c (here we use the fact that one is only allowed to buy either 0 or 1 shares of each security).",
        "Then, it may be verified that, given the ability to set w arbitrarily, the adversary can cause C to be unsatisfied iff it can cause both C1 and C2 to be unsatisfied.",
        "Hence, owning one share each of S1 and S2 is equivalent to owning one share of S. Note that C1 has three variables and C2 has k−1 variables.",
        "By applying the transformation successively, one obtains an equivalent set of securities, of polynomial size, whose payoff clauses have at most 3 variables.",
        "We note that in the basic construction, all of the clauses with more than 3 variables are associated with cheap securities (cost ).",
        "Instead of subdividing costs, we can simply make all of the resulting securities have cost ; the constraints on C and must reflect the new, larger number of cheap securities.",
        "One can ensure that all of the payoff clauses have exactly 3 variables, with a similar construction.",
        "A security S with cost c, payoff p and defining clause (x ∧ y) can be replaced by securities S1 and S2 with cost c/2, payoff p and defining clauses (x∧y∧w) and (x∧y∧ ¯w), where w is a new auxiliary variable.",
        "Essentially the same analysis as given above applies to this case.",
        "The case of single-variable payoff clauses is handled by two applications of this technique. 5.4.3 Reducing to equi-cost securities By setting C and appropriately, one can ensure that in the basic reduction every security costs a polynomially bounded integer multiple of ; call this ratio r. We now show how to reduce this case to the case where every security costs .",
        "Recall that the expensive securities have payoff clauses (¯xi ∧ Q) or (¯ni ∧ Q).",
        "Assume that security S has payoff clause (¯xi ∧ Q) (the other case is handled identically).",
        "Replace S with security S , with payoff clause (¯xi ∧ Q ∧ w1) (w1, . . . , wr−1 are auxiliary variables; fresh variables are chosen for each clause), and also S1, . . . , Sr−1, with payoff clauses ( ¯w1 ∧ w2), ( ¯w2 ∧ w3), . . . , ( ¯wr−2 ∧ wr−1), and( ¯wr−1 ∧ ¯w1).",
        "Clearly, buying none of the new securities is equivalent to not buying the original security.",
        "We show that buying all of the new securities is equivalent to buying the original security, and that buying a proper, nonempty subset of the securities is irrational.",
        "We first note that if the buyer buys securities S1, . . . , Sr−1, then the adversary must set w1 to be true, or one of the securities will pay off.",
        "To see this, note that if wi is set to false, then ( ¯wi ∧wi+1) will be true unless wi+1 is set to false; thus, setting w1 to false forces the adversary to set wr−1 to false, causing the final clause to be true.",
        "Having set w1 true, the adversary can set w2, . . . , wr−1 to false, ensuring that none of the securities S1, . . . , Sr−1 pays out.",
        "If wi is true, then (¯xi ∧ Q ∧ w1) is equivalent to (¯xi ∧ Q).",
        "So buying all of the replacement securities for each is equivalent to buying the original security for r. It remains to show that buying a proper, nonempty subset of the securities is irrational.",
        "If one doesnt buy S , then the adversary can set the w variables so that none of S1, . . . , Sr−1 will pay off; any money spent on these securities is wasted.",
        "If one doesnt buy Sr−1, the adversary can set all w to false, in which case none of the new clauses will pay off, regardless of the value of xi and Q.",
        "Similarly, if one 152 doesnt buy Si, for 1 ≤ i ≤ r −2, the adversary can set wi+1 to be true, all the other w variables to be false, and again there is no payoff, regardless of the value of xi and Q.",
        "Thus, buying a proper subset of these securities will not increase ones payoff.",
        "We note that this reduction can be combined trivially with the reduction that ensures that all of the defining clauses have 3 or fewer variables.",
        "With a slightly messier argument, all of the defining clauses can be set up to have exactly 3 variables. 5.4.4 Reducing to clauses of at most 2 variables If we allow securities to have variable payoffs and prices, we can reduce to the case where each securitys payoff clause is a conjunction of at most 2 variables or their negations.",
        "Given a security s with payoff clause (X ∧ Y ∧ Z), cost c and payoff 1, we introduce fresh auxiliary variables, w1, w2 and w3 (new variables are used for each clause) and replace S with the following securities: • Securities S1, S2 and S3, each with cost c/3 and payoff 1, with respective payoff clauses (X ∧ w1), (Y ∧ w2) and (Z ∧ w3). • Securities S1, . . . , S6, each with cost 4 and payoff 24 − 2, with payoff clauses, (w1 ∧ w2) (w1 ∧ w3) (w2 ∧ w3) ( ¯w1 ∧ ¯w2) ( ¯w1 ∧ ¯w3) ( ¯w2 ∧ ¯w3) Here, 2 is a tiny positive quantity, described later.",
        "By a simple case analysis, we have the following.",
        "Observations: 1.",
        "For any i, there exists a setting of w1, w2 an w3 such that of the S securities only Si pays off. 2.",
        "For any setting of w1, w2 and w3, at least one of the S securities will pay off. 3.",
        "If w1, w2 and w3 are all false, all of the S securities will pay off. 4.",
        "Setting one of w1, w2 or w3 to be true, and the others to be 0, will cause exactly one of the S securities to pay off.",
        "By Observation 1, there is no point in buying a nonempty proper subset of the S securities: The adversary can ensure that none of the bought securities will pay off, and even if all the S securities pay off, it will not be sufficient to recoup the cost of buying a single S security.",
        "By Observation 2, if one buys all the S securities, one is guaranteed to almost make back ones investment (except for 2), in which case by Observations 3 and 4, the adversaries optimal strategy is to make exactly one of w1, w2 or w3 true.",
        "We set C, and 2 so that Cn + (|cheap securities|) + 2(|clauses|) < 1.",
        "Thus, the accumulated losses of 2 can never spell the difference between making a guaranteed profit and making no profit at all.",
        "Note also that by making 2 positive we prevent the existence of break-even buying strategies in which the buyer only purchases S securities.",
        "Summarizing the previous argument, we may assume without loss of generality that the buyer buys all of the S securities (for all clauses), and that for each clause the adversary sets exactly one of that clauses auxiliary variables w1, w2 or w3 to be true.",
        "For the rest of the discussion, we assume that the players follow these constraints.",
        "We next claim that a rational buyer will either buy all of S1, S2 or S3, or none of them.",
        "If the buyer doesnt buy S1, then if the adversary makes w1 true and w2 and w3 false, neither S2 nor S3 will pay off, regardless of how the adversary sets X, Y and Z.",
        "Hence, there is no point in buying either S2 or S3 if one doesnt buy S1.",
        "Applying the same argument to S2 and S3 establishes the claim.",
        "Clearly, buying none of S1, S2 and S3 has, up to negligible 2 factors, the same price/payoff behavior as not buying S. We next argue that, subject to the established constraints put on the players behaviors, buying all of S1, S2 and S3 has the same price/payoff behavior (again ignoring 2 factors) as buying S, regardless of how the adversary sets X, Y and Z.",
        "First, in both cases, the cost is c. If the adversary makes X, Y and Z true, then S pays off 1, and (assuming that exactly one of w1, w2 and w3 is true), exactly one of S1, S2 or S3 will pay off 1.",
        "If X is false, then S doesnt pay off, and the adversary can set w1 true (and w2 and w3 false), ensuring that none of S1, S2 and S3 pays off.",
        "The same argument holds if Y or Z are false. 6.",
        "TRACTABLE CASES The logical question to ask in light of these complexity results is whether further, more severe restrictions on the space of securities can enable tractable matching algorithms.",
        "Although we have not systematically explored the possibilities, the potential for useful tractable cases certainly exists.",
        "Suppose, for example, that bids are limited to unit quantities of securities of the following two forms: 1.",
        "Disjunctions of positive events: A1 ∨ · · · ∨ Ak . 2.",
        "Single negative events: ¯Ai .",
        "Let p be the price offered for a disjunction A1 ∨ · · · ∨ Ak , and qi the maximal price offered for the respective negated disjuncts.",
        "This disjunction bid is part of a match iff p +P i qi ≥ k. Evaluating whether this condition is satisfied by a subset of bids is quite straightforward.",
        "Although this example is contrived, its application is not entirely implausible.",
        "For example, the disjunctions may correspond to insurance customers, who want an insurance contract to cover all the potential causes of their asset loss.",

                "Second, securities markets allow traders to speculate, or to obtain a subjective expected profit when market prices do not reflect their assessment of the likelihood of future outcomes.",
                "For example, a trader might buy a call option if he believes that the likelihood is high that the price of the underlying stock will go up, regardless of risk exposure to changes in the stock price.",
                "Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make <br>effective probability assessment</br>s, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].",

                "For example, given binary events A, B, and C, one trader might bid to buy three units of a security denoted A ∧ ¯B ∨ C that pays off $1 iff the compound event A ∧ ¯B ∨ C occurs for thirty cents each.",
                "Another trader may bid to sell six units of a security A|C that pays off $1 iff A occurs for fifty-five cents each, conditional on event C occurring, meaning that the transaction is revoked if C does not occur (i.e., no payoff is given and the price of the security is refunded) [5].",
                "Bids may also be divisible, meaning that bidders are willing to accept less than the requested quantity, or indivisible, meaning that bids must be fulfilled either completely or not at all.",

                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like CBOE [17], futures markets like CME [30], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [11, 12], sports betting markets [7, 13, 32], horse racing markets [33], idea futures markets [16], decision markets [14] and even market games [4, 24, 25].",
                "The economic value of securities markets is two-fold.",
                "First, they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "For example, the owner of a stock might buy a put option (the right to sell the stock at a particular price) in order to insure against a stock downturn.",
                "Or the owner of a house may purchase an insurance contract to hedge against unforeseen damage to the house.",
                "Second, securities markets allow traders to speculate, or to obtain a subjective expected profit when market prices do not reflect their assessment of the likelihood of future outcomes.",
                "For example, a trader might buy a call option if he believes that the likelihood is high that the price of the underlying stock will go up, regardless of risk exposure to changes in the stock price.",
                "Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].",
                "Real securities markets have complex payoff structures with various triggers.",
                "However, these can all be modeled as collections of more basic or atomic Arrow-Debreu securities [1, 8, 20].",
                "One unit of one Arrow-Debreu security pays off one dollar if and only if (iff) a corresponding binary event occurs; it pays nothing if the event does not occur.",
                "So, for example, one unit of a security denoted Acme100 might pay $1 iff Acmes stock is above $100 on January 4, 2004.",
                "An Acme stock option as it would be defined on a finan144 cial exchange can be though of as a portfolio of such atomic securities.1 In this paper, we develop and analyze a framework for trading in compound securities markets with payoffs contingent on arbitrary logical combinations of events, including conditionals.",
                "For example, given binary events A, B, and C, one trader might bid to buy three units of a security denoted A ∧ ¯B ∨ C that pays off $1 iff the compound event A ∧ ¯B ∨ C occurs for thirty cents each.",
                "Another trader may bid to sell six units of a security A|C that pays off $1 iff A occurs for fifty-five cents each, conditional on event C occurring, meaning that the transaction is revoked if C does not occur (i.e., no payoff is given and the price of the security is refunded) [5].",
                "Bids may also be divisible, meaning that bidders are willing to accept less than the requested quantity, or indivisible, meaning that bids must be fulfilled either completely or not at all.",
                "Given a set of such bids, the auctioneer faces a complex matching problem to decide which bids are accepted for how many units at what price.",
                "Typically, the auctioneer seeks to take on no risk of its own, only matching up agreeable trades among the bidders, but we also consider alternative formulations where the auctioneer acts as a market maker willing to accept some risk.",
                "We examine the computational complexity of the auctioneers matching problem.",
                "Let the length of the description of all the available securities be O(n).",
                "With n events, the matching problem is co-NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "This Σp 2-complete hardness holds even when the bidding language is significantly restricted.",
                "With log n events, the problem is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case.",

                "PRELIMINARIES 2.1 Background and notation Imagine a world where there are only two future uncertain events of any consequence: (1) the event that ones house is struck by lightning by December 31, 2003, denoted struck, and (2) the event that Acmes stock price goes above $100 by January 4, 2004, denoted acme100.",
                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",
                "Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.",
                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
                "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",
                "They show that, if all agents risk-neutral independencies agree with the independencies encoded in the market structure, then the market is operationally complete.",
                "For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.",
                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
                "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",
                "Compound securities differ from combinatorial auctions in concept and complexity.",
                "Compound securities allow bidders to construct an arbitrary bet on any of the 22n possible compound events expressible as logical functions of the n base events, conditional on any other of the 22n compound events.",

                "The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.",
                "Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.",

                "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
                "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
                "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",

                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",

                "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
                "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",

                "Second, securities markets allow traders to speculate, or to obtain a subjective expected profit when market prices do not reflect their assessment of the likelihood of future outcomes.",
                "For example, a trader might buy a call option if he believes that the likelihood is high that the price of the underlying stock will go up, regardless of risk exposure to changes in the stock price.",
                "Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].",

                "An Acme stock option as it would be defined on a finan144 cial exchange can be though of as a portfolio of such atomic securities.1 In this paper, we develop and analyze a framework for trading in compound securities markets with payoffs contingent on arbitrary logical combinations of events, including conditionals.",
                "For example, given binary events A, B, and C, one trader might bid to buy three units of a security denoted A ∧ ¯B ∨ C that pays off $1 iff the compound event A ∧ ¯B ∨ C occurs for thirty cents each.",

                "PRELIMINARIES 2.1 Background and notation Imagine a world where there are only two future uncertain events of any consequence: (1) the event that ones house is struck by lightning by December 31, 2003, denoted struck, and (2) the event that Acmes stock price goes above $100 by January 4, 2004, denoted acme100.",
                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",
                "Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.",
                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
                "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",
                "They show that, if all agents risk-neutral independencies agree with the independencies encoded in the market structure, then the market is operationally complete.",
                "For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.",
                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
                "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",
                "Compound securities differ from combinatorial auctions in concept and complexity.",
                "Compound securities allow bidders to construct an arbitrary bet on any of the 22n possible compound events expressible as logical functions of the n base events, conditional on any other of the 22n compound events.",
                "Agents optimize based on their own subjective probabilities and risk attitude (and in general, their beliefs about other agents beliefs and utilities, ad infinitum).",
                "The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.",
                "Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.",
                "Typically, 3 Specifically, one unit of each pays off $2 iff both A and B occur, $1 iff A or B occurs (but not both), and $0 otherwise. uncertainty-and thus risk-is not considered.",
                "The central auctioneer problem is to maximize social welfare.",
                "Also note that the problems lie in different complexity classes.",
                "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
                "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
                "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",
                "Hanson [15] develops a market mechanism called a market scoring rule that is especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.",
                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.",
                "The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded.",
                "Though Hanson offers some initial suggestions, several open problems remain, including efficient methods for representing and updating the joint distribution and recording traders positions and portfolios, without resorting to exponential time and space algorithms.",
                "Fagin, Halpern, and Megiddo [9] give a sound and complete axiomatization for deciding whether sets of probabilistic inequalities are consistent.",
                "Bids for compound securities can be thought of as expressions of probabilistic inequalities: for example, a bid to buy A ∧ B at price 0.3 is a statement that the probability of A ∧ B is greater than 0.3.",
                "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
                "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",

                "FRAMEWORK FOR TRADING IN COMPOUND SECURITIES 3.1 High-level description Common knowledge among agents is the set of events A.",
                "There are no predefined securities.",

                "Combination operators may include conjunctions, disjunctions, and conditionals.",
                "For all practical purposes, it is impossible for agents to trade in enough securities (2n ) to form a complete market, so agents must devise their best tradeoff between the number and complexity of their bids, and the extent to which their risks are hedged and desirable bets are placed.",
                "In its most general form, the problem is game-theoretic in nature, since what an agent should offer depends on what it believes other agents will accept.",
                "At the other end of the spectrum, a simplified version of the problem is to optimize bids only on currently available securities at current prices.",
                "In between these two formulations are other possible interesting optimization problems.",
                "Approximation algorithms might also be pursued.",
                "The auctioneer faces a nontrivial problem of matching buy and sell orders to maximize surplus (the cash and securities left over after accepted bids are fulfilled).",
                "For example, offers to sell A1A2 at $0.2 and A1 ¯A2 at $0.1 can match with an offer to buy A1 at $0.4, with surplus $0.1.",
                "Or an offer to sell A1 at $0.3 can match with an offer to buy A1A2 at $0.4, with surplus $0.1 in cash and A1 ¯A2 in securities.",
                "In general, a single security might qualify for multiple matches, but only one can be transacted.",
                "So the auctioneer must find the optimal set of matches that maximizes surplus, which could be measured in a number of ways.",

                "Examples include stock markets like NASDAQ, options markets like CBOE [17], futures markets like CME [30], other derivatives markets, insurance markets, political stock markets [11, 12], sports betting markets [7, 13, 32], horse racing markets [33], idea futures markets [16], decision markets [14] and even market games [4, 24, 25].",
                "The economic value of securities markets is two-fold.",
                "First, they allow traders to hedge risk, or to insure against undesirable outcomes.",
                "For example, the owner of a stock might buy a put option (the right to sell the stock at a particular price) in order to insure against a stock downturn.",
                "Or the owner of a house may purchase an insurance contract to hedge against unforeseen damage to the house.",
                "Second, securities markets allow traders to speculate, or to obtain a subjective expected profit when market prices do not reflect their assessment of the likelihood of future outcomes.",
                "For example, a trader might buy a call option if he believes that the likelihood is high that the price of the underlying stock will go up, regardless of risk exposure to changes in the stock price.",
                "Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].",
                "Real securities markets have complex payoff structures with various triggers.",
                "However, these can all be modeled as collections of more basic or atomic Arrow-Debreu securities [1, 8, 20].",
                "One unit of one Arrow-Debreu security pays off one dollar if and only if (iff) a corresponding binary event occurs; it pays nothing if the event does not occur.",
                "So, for example, one unit of a security denoted Acme100 might pay $1 iff Acmes stock is above $100 on January 4, 2004.",
                "An Acme stock option as it would be defined on a finan144 cial exchange can be though of as a portfolio of such atomic securities.1 In this paper, we develop and analyze a framework for trading in compound securities markets with payoffs contingent on arbitrary logical combinations of events, including conditionals.",
                "For example, given binary events A, B, and C, one trader might bid to buy three units of a security denoted A ∧ ¯B ∨ C that pays off $1 iff the compound event A ∧ ¯B ∨ C occurs for thirty cents each.",
                "Another trader may bid to sell six units of a security A|C that pays off $1 iff A occurs for fifty-five cents each, conditional on event C occurring, meaning that the transaction is revoked if C does not occur (i.e., no payoff is given and the price of the security is refunded) [5].",

                "Typically, the auctioneer seeks to take on no risk of its own, only matching up agreeable trades among the bidders, but we also consider alternative formulations where the auctioneer acts as a market maker willing to accept some risk.",

                "PRELIMINARIES 2.1 Background and notation Imagine a world where there are only two future uncertain events of any consequence: (1) the event that ones house is struck by lightning by December 31, 2003, denoted struck, and (2) the event that Acmes stock price goes above $100 by January 4, 2004, denoted acme100.",
                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",
                "Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.",
                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
                "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",
                "They show that, if all agents risk-neutral independencies agree with the independencies encoded in the market structure, then the market is operationally complete.",
                "For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.",
                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
                "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",
                "Compound securities differ from combinatorial auctions in concept and complexity.",
                "Compound securities allow bidders to construct an arbitrary bet on any of the 22n possible compound events expressible as logical functions of the n base events, conditional on any other of the 22n compound events.",
                "Agents optimize based on their own subjective probabilities and risk attitude (and in general, their beliefs about other agents beliefs and utilities, ad infinitum).",
                "The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.",
                "Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.",
                "Typically, 3 Specifically, one unit of each pays off $2 iff both A and B occur, $1 iff A or B occurs (but not both), and $0 otherwise. uncertainty-and thus risk-is not considered.",
                "The central auctioneer problem is to maximize social welfare.",
                "Also note that the problems lie in different complexity classes.",
                "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
                "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
                "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",
                "Hanson [15] develops a market mechanism called a market scoring rule that is especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.",
                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.",
                "The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded.",
                "Though Hanson offers some initial suggestions, several open problems remain, including efficient methods for representing and updating the joint distribution and recording traders positions and portfolios, without resorting to exponential time and space algorithms.",
                "Fagin, Halpern, and Megiddo [9] give a sound and complete axiomatization for deciding whether sets of probabilistic inequalities are consistent.",
                "Bids for compound securities can be thought of as expressions of probabilistic inequalities: for example, a bid to buy A ∧ B at price 0.3 is a statement that the probability of A ∧ B is greater than 0.3.",
                "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
                "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",

                "Combination operators may include conjunctions, disjunctions, and conditionals.",
                "For all practical purposes, it is impossible for agents to trade in enough securities (2n ) to form a complete market, so agents must devise their best tradeoff between the number and complexity of their bids, and the extent to which their risks are hedged and desirable bets are placed.",
                "In its most general form, the problem is game-theoretic in nature, since what an agent should offer depends on what it believes other agents will accept.",
                "At the other end of the spectrum, a simplified version of the problem is to optimize bids only on currently available securities at current prices.",
                "In between these two formulations are other possible interesting optimization problems.",
                "Approximation algorithms might also be pursued.",
                "The auctioneer faces a nontrivial problem of matching buy and sell orders to maximize surplus (the cash and securities left over after accepted bids are fulfilled).",
                "For example, offers to sell A1A2 at $0.2 and A1 ¯A2 at $0.1 can match with an offer to buy A1 at $0.4, with surplus $0.1.",

                "Second, securities markets allow traders to speculate, or to obtain a subjective expected profit when market prices do not reflect their assessment of the likelihood of future outcomes.",
                "For example, a trader might buy a call option if he believes that the likelihood is high that the price of the underlying stock will go up, regardless of risk exposure to changes in the stock price.",
                "Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].",

                "However, these can all be modeled as collections of more basic or atomic Arrow-Debreu securities [1, 8, 20].",
                "One unit of one Arrow-Debreu security pays off one dollar if and only if (iff) a corresponding binary event occurs; it pays nothing if the event does not occur.",
                "So, for example, one unit of a security denoted Acme100 might pay $1 iff Acmes stock is above $100 on January 4, 2004.",

                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",
                "Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.",
                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
                "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",
                "They show that, if all agents risk-neutral independencies agree with the independencies encoded in the market structure, then the market is operationally complete.",
                "For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.",
                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
                "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",
                "Compound securities differ from combinatorial auctions in concept and complexity.",
                "Compound securities allow bidders to construct an arbitrary bet on any of the 22n possible compound events expressible as logical functions of the n base events, conditional on any other of the 22n compound events.",
                "Agents optimize based on their own subjective probabilities and risk attitude (and in general, their beliefs about other agents beliefs and utilities, ad infinitum).",
                "The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.",
                "Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.",
                "Typically, 3 Specifically, one unit of each pays off $2 iff both A and B occur, $1 iff A or B occurs (but not both), and $0 otherwise. uncertainty-and thus risk-is not considered.",
                "The central auctioneer problem is to maximize social welfare.",
                "Also note that the problems lie in different complexity classes.",
                "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
                "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
                "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",
                "Hanson [15] develops a market mechanism called a market scoring rule that is especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.",
                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.",
                "The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded.",
                "Though Hanson offers some initial suggestions, several open problems remain, including efficient methods for representing and updating the joint distribution and recording traders positions and portfolios, without resorting to exponential time and space algorithms.",
                "Fagin, Halpern, and Megiddo [9] give a sound and complete axiomatization for deciding whether sets of probabilistic inequalities are consistent.",
                "Bids for compound securities can be thought of as expressions of probabilistic inequalities: for example, a bid to buy A ∧ B at price 0.3 is a statement that the probability of A ∧ B is greater than 0.3.",
                "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
                "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",

                "Combination operators may include conjunctions, disjunctions, and conditionals.",
                "For all practical purposes, it is impossible for agents to trade in enough securities (2n ) to form a complete market, so agents must devise their best tradeoff between the number and complexity of their bids, and the extent to which their risks are hedged and desirable bets are placed.",
                "In its most general form, the problem is game-theoretic in nature, since what an agent should offer depends on what it believes other agents will accept.",
                "At the other end of the spectrum, a simplified version of the problem is to optimize bids only on currently available securities at current prices.",
                "In between these two formulations are other possible interesting optimization problems.",
                "Approximation algorithms might also be pursued.",

                "Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].",

                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",
                "Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.",
                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
                "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",

                "For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.",
                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
                "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",

                "The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.",
                "Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.",

                "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
                "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
                "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",

                "The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.",
                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.",
                "The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded.",

                "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
                "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",

                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",

                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
                "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",

                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
                "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",

                "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
                "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
                "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",

                "The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.",
                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.",
                "The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded.",

                "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
                "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",

                "Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].",

                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",
                "Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.",
                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
                "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",

                "For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.",
                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
                "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",

                "The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.",
                "Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.",

                "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
                "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
                "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",

                "The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.",
                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.",
                "The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded.",

                "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
                "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",

                "For example, a trader might buy a call option if he believes that the likelihood is high that the price of the underlying stock will go up, regardless of risk exposure to changes in the stock price.",
                "Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].",

                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",
                "Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.",
                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
                "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",

                "For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.",
                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
                "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",

                "The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.",
                "Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.",

                "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
                "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
                "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",

                "The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.",
                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.",
                "The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded.",
                "Though Hanson offers some initial suggestions, several open problems remain, including efficient methods for representing and updating the joint distribution and recording traders positions and portfolios, without resorting to exponential time and space algorithms.",

                "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
                "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",

                "Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].",

                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",
                "Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.",
                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
                "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",

                "For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.",
                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
                "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",

                "The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.",
                "Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.",

                "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
                "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
                "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",

                "The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.",
                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.",
                "The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded.",

                "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
                "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",

                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",
                "Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.",
                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to <br>hedge</br> against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any <br>hedge</br> or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
                "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",

                "For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.",
                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
                "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",
                "Compound securities differ from combinatorial auctions in concept and complexity.",
                "Compound securities allow bidders to construct an arbitrary bet on any of the 22n possible compound events expressible as logical functions of the n base events, conditional on any other of the 22n compound events.",

                "The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.",
                "Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.",

                "The central auctioneer problem is to maximize social welfare.",
                "Also note that the problems lie in different complexity classes.",
                "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
                "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
                "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",
                "Hanson [15] develops a market mechanism called a market scoring rule that is especially well suited for allowing bets on a combinatorial number of outcomes.",
                "The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.",
                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.",
                "The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded.",
                "Though Hanson offers some initial suggestions, several open problems remain, including efficient methods for representing and updating the joint distribution and recording traders positions and portfolios, without resorting to exponential time and space algorithms.",

                "Bids for compound securities can be thought of as expressions of probabilistic inequalities: for example, a bid to buy A ∧ B at price 0.3 is a statement that the probability of A ∧ B is greater than 0.3.",
                "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
                "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",

                "Because traders stand to earn a profit if they can make effective probability assessments, often prices in financial markets yield very accurate aggregate forecasts of future events [10, 29, 27, 28].",

                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",
                "Hedging risk can be thought of as an action of moving money between various possible future states.",
                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or <br>speculate</br> upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",
                "The authors show that in some cases the market can be structured and compacted in analogy to Bayesian network representations of joint probability distributions [23].",

                "For collections of agents all with constant absolute risk aversion, agreement on Markov independencies is sufficient.",
                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",
                "In this way bidders can express substitutability and complementarity relationships among goods that cannot be expressed in standard parallel or sequential auctions.",
                "Compound securities differ from combinatorial auctions in concept and complexity.",
                "Compound securities allow bidders to construct an arbitrary bet on any of the 22n possible compound events expressible as logical functions of the n base events, conditional on any other of the 22n compound events.",

                "The central auctioneer problem is identifying arbitrage opportunities: that is, to match bets together without taking on any risk.",
                "Combinatorial auctions, on the other hand, allow bids on any of the 2n bundles of n goods.",

                "Also note that the problems lie in different complexity classes.",
                "While clearing a combinatorial auction is polynomial in the divisible case and NP-complete in the indivisible case, matching in a compound securities market is NP-complete in the divisible case and Σp 2-complete in the indivisible case.",
                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",
                "There is a sense in which it is possible to translate our matching problem for compound securities into an analogous problem for clearing two-sided combinatorial exchanges [31] of exponential size.",
                "Specifically, if we regard payoff in a particular state as a good, then compound securities can be viewed as bundles of (fractional quantities of) such goods.",
                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",

                "The mechanism maintains a joint probability distribution over all 2n states, either explicitly or implicitly using a Bayesian network or other compact representation.",
                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
                "In the limit of a single trader, the mechanism behaves like a scoring rule, suitable for polling a single agent for its probability distribution.",
                "In the limit of many traders, it produces a combined estimate.",
                "Since the market essentially always has a complete set of posted prices for all possible outcomes, the mechanism avoids the problem of thin markets, or illiquidity, that necessarily plagues any market containing an exponential number of alternative investments.",
                "The mechanism requires a patron to pay off the final person to change the distribution, though the patrons payment is bounded.",
                "Though Hanson offers some initial suggestions, several open problems remain, including efficient methods for representing and updating the joint distribution and recording traders positions and portfolios, without resorting to exponential time and space algorithms.",

                "If a set of single-unit bids correspond to a set of inconsistent probabilistic inequalities, then there is a match.",
                "However, because they are interested in a much different framework, Fagin et al. do not consider several complicating factors specific to the securities market framework: namely, handling multi-unit or fractional bid quantities, identifying matches, choosing among multiple matches, and optimizing based on probabilities and risk attitudes.",

                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",

                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",

                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",
                "For example, CVT may allow an agent to order securities A and B in a bundle that pays off as a linear combination of A and B,3 but CVT wont allow the construction of a compound security A ∧ B that pays off $1 iff both A and B occur, or a compound security A|B .",
                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",

                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",

                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",

                "In this simple world there are four possible future states-all possible combinations of the binary events outcomes: struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100, struck ∧ acme100.",

                "For example, insur1 Technically, an option is a portfolio of infinitely many atomic securities, though it can be approximately modeled with a finite number. ing ones house transfers money from future states where struck is not true to states where it is.",
                "Selling a security denoted acme100 -that pays off $1 iff the event acme100 occurs-transfers money from future states where Acmes price is above $100 on January 4 to states where its not.",
                "Speculating is also an act of transferring money between future states, though usually associated with maximizing expected return rather than reducing risk.",
                "For example, betting on a football team moves money from the team loses state to the team wins state.",
                "In practice, agents engage in a mixture of hedging and speculating, and there is no clear dividing line between the two [18].",
                "All possible future outcomes form a state space Ω, consisting of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states ω ∈ Ω.",
                "Often a more natural way to think of possible future outcomes is as an event space A of linearly independent events A ∈ A that may overlap arbitrarily.",
                "So in our toy example struck ∧ acme100 is one of the four disjoint states, while struck is one of the two events.",
                "Note that a set of n linearly independent events defines a state space Ω of size 2n consisting of all possible combinations of event outcomes.",
                "Conversely, any state space Ω can be factored into log |Ω| events.",
                "Suppose that A exhaustively covers all meaningful future outcomes (i.e., covers all eventualities that agents may wish to hedge against and/or speculate upon).",
                "Then the existence of 2n linearly independent securities-called a complete market-allows agents to distribute their wealth arbitrarily across future states.2 An agent may create any hedge or speculation it desires.",
                "Under classical conditions, agents trading in a complete market form an equilibrium where risk is allocated Pareto optimally.",
                "If the market is incomplete, meaning it consists of fewer than 2n linearly independent securities, then in general agents cannot construct arbitrary hedges and equilibrium allocations may be nonoptimal [1, 8, 19, 20].",
                "In real-world settings, the number of meaningful events n is large and thus the number of securities required for completeness is intractable.",
                "No truly complete market exists or will ever exist.",
                "One motivation behind compound securities markets is to provide a mechanism that supports the most transfer of risk using the least number of transactions possible.",
                "Compound securities allow a high degree of expressivity in constructing bids.",
                "The tradeoff for increased expressivity is increased computational complexity, from both the bidders and auctioneers point of view. 2.2 Related work The quest to reduce the number of financial instruments required to support an optimal allocation of risk dates to Arrows original work [1].",
                "The requirement stated above of only 2n linearly-independent securities is itself a reduction from the most straightforward formulation.",
                "In an economy with k standard goods, the most straightforward complete market contains k·2n securities, each paying off in one good under one state realization.",
                "Arrow [1] showed that a market where securities and goods are essentially separated, with 2n securities paying off in a single numeraire good plus k spot markets in the standard goods, is also complete.",
                "For our purposes, we need consider only the securities market. 2 By linearly independent securities, we mean that the vectors of payoffs in all future states of these securities are linearly independent. 145 Varian [34] shows that a complete market can be constructed using fewer than 2n securities, replacing the missing securities with options.",
                "Still, the number of linearly independent financial instruments-securities plus optionsmust be 2n to guarantee completeness.",
                "Though the requirement of 2n financial instruments cannot be relaxed if one wants to guarantee completeness in all circumstances, Pennock and Wellman [26] explore conditions under which a smaller securities market may be operationally complete, meaning that its equilibrium is Pareto optimal with respect to the agents involved, even if the market contains less than 2n securities.",

                "Bossaerts, Fine, and Ledyard [2] develop a mechanism they call combined-value trading (CVT) that allows traders to order an arbitrary portfolio of securities in one bid, rather than breaking up the order into a sequence of bids on individual securities.",
                "If the portfolio order is accepted, all of the implied trades on individual securities are executed simultaneously, thus eliminating so-called execution risk that prices will change in the middle of a planned sequence of orders.",
                "The authors conduct laboratory experiments showing that, even in thin markets where ordinary sequential trading breaks down, CVT supports efficient pricing and allocation.",
                "Note that CVT differs significantly from compound securities trading.",
                "CVT allows instantaneous trading of any linear combination of securities, while compound securities allow more expressive securities that can encode nonlinear boolean combinations of events.",

                "Related to CVT are combinatorial auctions [6, 21] and exchanges [31], mechanisms that have recently received quite a bit of attention in the economics and computer science literatures.",
                "Combinatorial auctions allow bidders to place distinct values on all possible bundles of goods rather than just on individual goods.",

                "In fact, even the problem of deciding whether two bids on compound securities match, even in the divisible case, is NP-complete (see Section 5.2).",

                "The material balance constraint facing the combinatorial auctioneer corresponds to a restriction that the compoundsecurity auctioneer be disallowed from assuming any risk.",
                "Note that this translation is not at all useful for addressing the compound-security matching problem, as the resulting combinatorial exchange has an exponential number of goods.",

                "At any time any trader who believes the probabilities are wrong can change any part of the distribution by accepting a lottery ticket that pays off according to a scoring rule (e.g., the logarithmic scoring rule) [35], as long as that trader also agrees to pay off the most recent person to change the distribution.",
