The ability to preserve the privacy of all participants is an essential requirement of the underlying Information Filtering architectures, because the deployed Recommender Systems have to be accepted by privacy-aware users as well as information and service providers. Existing approaches neglect to address privacy in this multilateral way. We have developed an approach for privacy-preserving Recommender Systems based on Multi-Agent System technology which enables applications to generate recommendations via various filtering techniques while preserving the privacy of all participants. We describe the main modules of our solution as well as an application we have implemented based on this approach.

INTRODUCTION Information Filtering (IF) systems aim at countering information overload by extracting information that is relevant for a given user out of a large body of information available via an information provider. In contrast to Information Retrieval (IR) systems, where relevant information is extracted based on search queries, IF architectures generate personalized information based on user profiles containing, for each given user, personal data, preferences, and rated items. The provided body of information is usually structured and collected in provider profiles. Filtering techniques operate on these profiles in order to generate recommendations of items that are probably relevant for a given user, or in order to determine users with similar interests, or both. Depending on the respective goal, the resulting systems constitute Recommender Systems [5], Matchmaker Systems [10], or a combination thereof. The aspect of privacy is an essential issue in all IF systems: Generating personalized information obviously requires the use of personal data. According to surveys indicating major privacy concerns of users in the context of Recommender Systems and e-commerce in general [23], users can be expected to be less reluctant to provide personal information if they trust the system to be privacy-preserving with regard to personal data. Similar considerations also apply to the information provider, who may want to control the dissemination of the provided information, and to the provider of the filtering techniques, who may not want the details of the utilized filtering algorithms to become common knowledge. A privacy-preserving IF system should therefore balance these requirements and protect the privacy of all parties involved in a multilateral way, while addressing general requirements regarding performance, security and quality of the recommendations as well. As described in the following section, there are several approaches with similar goals, but none of these provide a generic approach in which the privacy of all parties is preserved. We have developed an agent-based approach for privacypreserving IF which has been utilized for realizing a combined Recommender/Matchmaker System as part of an application supporting users in planning entertainment-related activities. In this paper, we focus on the Recommender System functionality. Our approach is based on Multi-Agent System (MAS) technology because fundamental features of agents such as autonomy, adaptability and the ability to communicate are essential requirements of our approach. In other words, the realized approach does not merely constitute a solution for privacy-preserving IF within a MAS context, but rather utilizes a MAS architecture in order to realize a solution for privacy-preserving IF, which could not be realized easily otherwise. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes related work. Section 3 describes the general ideas of our approach. In Section 4, we describe essential details of the 319 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS modules of our approach and their implementation. In Section 5, we evaluate the approach, mainly via the realized application. Section 6 concludes the paper with an outlook and outlines further work. 2. RELATED WORK There is a large amount of work in related areas, such as Private Information Retrieval [7], Privacy-Preserving Data Mining [2], and other privacy-preserving protocols [4, 16], most of which is based on Secure Multi-Party Computation [27]. We have ruled out Secure Multi-Party Computation approaches mainly because of their complexity, and because the algorithm that is computed securely is not considered to be private in these approaches. Various enforcement mechanisms have been suggested that are applicable in the context of privacy-preserving Information Filtering, such as enterprise privacy policies [17] or hippocratic databases [1], both of which annotate user data with additional meta-information specifying how the data is to be handled on the provider side. These approaches ultimately assume that the provider actually intends to protect the privacy of the user data, and offer support for this task, but they are not intended to prevent the provider from acting in a malicious manner. Trusted computing, as specified by the Trusted Computing Group, aims at realizing trusted systems by increasing the security of open systems to a level comparable with the level of security that is achievable in closed systems. It is based on a combination of tamper-proof hardware and various software components. Some example applications, including peer-to-peer networks, distributed firewalls, and distributed computing in general, are listed in [13]. There are some approaches for privacy-preserving Recommender Systems based on distributed collaborative filtering, in which recommendations are generated via a public model aggregating the distributed user profiles without containing explicit information about user profiles themselves. This is achieved via Secure Multi-Party Computation [6], or via random perturbation of the user data [20]. In [19], various approaches are integrated within a single architecture. In [10], an agent-based approach is described in which user agents representing similar users are discovered via a transitive traversal of user agents. Privacy is preserved through pseudonymous interaction between the agents and through adding obfuscating data to personal information. More recent related approaches are described in [18]. In [3], an agent-based architecture for privacy-preserving demographic filtering is described which may be generalized in order to support other kinds of filtering techniques. While in some aspects similar to our approach, this architecture addresses at least two aspects inadequately, namely the protection of the filter against manipulation attempts, and the prevention of collusions between the filter and the provider. 3. PRIVACY-PRESERVING INFORMATION FILTERING We identify three main abstract entities participating in an information filtering process within a distributed system: A user entity, a provider entity, and a filter entity. Whereas in some applications the provider and filter entities explicitly trust each other, because they are deployed by the same party, our solution is applicable more generically because it does not require any trust between the main abstract entities. In this paper, we focus on aspects related to the information filtering process itself, and omit all aspects related to information collection and processing, i.e. the stages in which profiles are generated and maintained, mainly because these stages are less critical with regard to privacy, as they involve fewer different entities. 3.1 Requirements Our solution aims at meeting the following requirements with regard to privacy: • User Privacy: No linkable information about user profiles should be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party, including other user entities. Single user profile items, however, may be acquired permanently if they are unlinkable, i.e. if they cannot be attributed to a specific user or linked to other user profile items. Temporary acquisition of private information is permitted as well. Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user. These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties. Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted. Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider. Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information. • Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party. General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique. In addition, general requirements regarding the quality of the recommendations as well as security aspects, performance and broadness of the resulting system have to be addressed as well. While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements. 3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity. The filter entity provides the recommendations, and subsequently deletes all private information, thus fulfilling the requirement regarding permanent acquisition of private information. 320 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The entities whose private information is propagated have to be certain that the respective information is actually acquired temporarily only. Trust in this regard may be established in two main ways: • Trusted Software: The respective entity itself is trusted to remove the respective information as specified. • Trusted Environment: The respective entity operates in an environment that is trusted to control the communication and life cycle of the entity to an extent that the removal of the respective information may be achieved regardless of the attempted actions of the entity itself. Additionally, the environment itself is trusted not to act in a malicious manner (e.g. it is trusted not to acquire and propagate the respective information itself). In both cases, trust may be established in various ways. Reputation-based mechanisms, additional trusted third parties certifying entities or environments, or trusted computing mechanisms may be used. Our approach is based on a trusted environment realized via trusted computing mechanisms, because we see this solution as the most generic and realistic approach. This decision is discussed briefly in Section 5. We are now able to specify the abstract information filtering protocol as shown in Figure 1: The filter entity deploys a Temporary Filter Entity (TFE) operating in a trusted environment. The user entity deploys an additional relay entity operating in the same environment. Through mechanisms provided by this environment, the relay entity is able to control the communication of the TFE, and the provider entity is able to control the communication of both relay entity and the TFE. Thus, it is possible to ensure that the controlled entities are only able to propagate recommendations, but no other private information. In the first stage (steps 1.1 to 1.3 of Figure 1), the relay entity establishes control of the TFE, and thus prevents it from propagating user profile information. User profile data is propagated without participation of the provider entity from the user entity to the TFE via the relay entity. In the second stage (steps 2.1 to 2.3 of Figure 1), the provider entity establishes control of both relay and TFE, and thus prevents them from propagating provider profile information. Provider profile data is propagated from the provider entity to the TFE via the relay entity. In the third stage (steps 3.1 to 3.5 of Figure 1), the TFE returns the recommendations via the relay entity, and the controlled entities are terminated. Taken together, these steps ensure that all private information is acquired temporarily only by the other main entities. The problems of determining acceptable queries on the provider profile and ensuring unlinkability of the recommendations are discussed in the following section. Our approach requires each entity in the distributed architecture to have the following five main abilities: The ability to perform certain well-defined tasks (such as carrying out a filtering process) with a high degree of autonomy, i.e. largely independent of other entities (e.g. because the respective entity is not able to communicate in an unrestricted manner), the ability to be deployable dynamically in a well-defined environment, the ability to communicate with other entities, the ability to achieve protection against external manipulation attempts, and the ability to control and restrict the communication of other entities. Figure 1: The abstract privacy-preserving information filtering protocol. All communication across the environments indicated by dashed lines is prevented with the exception of communication with the controlling entity. MAS architectures are an ideal solution for realizing a distributed system characterized by these features, because they provide agents constituting entities that are actually characterized by autonomy, mobility and the ability to communicate [26], as well as agent platforms as environments providing means to realize the security of agents. In this context, the issue of malicious hosts, i.e. hosts attacking agents, has to be addressed explicitly. Furthermore, existing MAS architectures generally do not allow agents to control the communication of other agents. It is possible, however, to expand a MAS architecture and to provide designated agents with this ability. For these reasons, our solution is based on a FIPA[11]-compliant MAS architecture. The entities introduced above are mapped directly to agents, and the trusted environment in which they exist is realized in the form of agent platforms. In addition to the MAS architecture itself, which is assumed as given, our solution consists of the following five main modules: • The Controller Module described in Section 4.1 provides functionality for controlling the communication capabilities of agents. • The Transparent Persistence Module facilitates the use of different data storage mechanisms, and provides a uniform interface for accessing persistent information, which may be utilized for monitoring critical interactions involving potentially private information e.g. as part of queries. Its description is outside the scope of this paper. • The Recommender Module, details of which are described in Section 4.2, provides Recommender System functionality. • The Matchmaker Module provides Matchmaker System functionality. It additionally utilizes social aspects of MAS technology. Its description is outside the scope of this paper. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 321 • Finally, a separate module described in Section 4.4 provides Exemplary Filtering Techniques in order to show that various restrictions imposed on filtering techniques by our approach may actually be fulfilled. The trusted environment introduced above encompasses the MAS architecture itself and the Controller Module, which have to be trusted to act in a non-malicious manner in order to rule out the possibility of malicious hosts. 4. MAIN MODULES AND IMPLEMENTATION In this section, we describe the main modules of our approach, and outline the implementation. While we have chosen a specific architecture for the implementation, the specification of the module is applicable to any FIPA-compliant MAS architecture. A module basically encompasses ontologies, functionality provided by agents via agent services, and internal functionality. Throughout this paper, {m}KX denotes a message m encrypted via a non-specified symmetric encryption scheme with a secret key KX used for encryption and decryption which is initially known only to participant X. A key KXY is a key shared by participants X and Y . A cryptographic hash function is used at various points of the protocol, i.e. a function returning a hash value h(x) for given data x that is both preimage-resistant and collision-resistant1 . We denote a set of hash values for a data set X = {x1, .., xn} as H(X) = {h(x1), .., h(xn)}, whereas h(X) denotes a single hash value of a data set. 4.1 Controller Module As noted above, the ability to control the communication of agents is generally not a feature of existing MAS architectures2 but at the same time a central requirement of our approach for privacy-preserving Information Filtering. The required functionality cannot be realized based on regular agent services or components, because an agent on a platform is usually not allowed to interfere with the actions of other agents in any way. Therefore, we add additional infrastructure providing the required functionality to the MAS architecture itself, resulting in an agent environment with extended functionality and responsibilities. Controlling the communication capabilities of an agent is realized by restricting via rules, in a manner similar to a firewall, but with the consent of the respective agent, its incoming and outgoing communication to specific platforms or agents on external platforms as well as other possible communication channels, such as the file system. Consent is required because otherwise the overall security would be compromised, as attackers could arbitrarily block various communication channels. Our approach does not require controlling the communication between agents on the same platform, and therefore this aspect is not addressed. Consequently, all rules addressing communication capabilities have to be enforced across entire platforms, because otherwise a controlled agent could just use a non-controlled agent 1 In the implementation, we have used the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the symmetric encryption scheme and SHA-1 as the cryptographic hash function. 2 A recent survey on agent environments [24] concludes that aspects related to agent environments are often neglected, and does not indicate any existing work in this particular area. on the same platform as a relay for communicating with agents residing on external platforms. Various agent services provide functionality for adding and revoking control of platforms, including functionality required in complex scenarios where controlled agents in turn control further platforms. The implementation of the actual control mechanism depends on the actual MAS architecture. In our implementation, we have utilized methods provided via the Java Security Manager as part of the Java security model. Thus, the supervisor agent is enabled to define custom security policies, thereby granting or denying other agents access to resources required for communication with other agents as well as communication in general, such as files or sockets for TCP/IP-based communication. 4.2 Recommender Module The Recommender Module is mainly responsible for carrying out information filtering processes, according to the protocol described in Table 1. The participating entities are realized as agents, and the interactions as agent services. We assume that mechanisms for secure agent communication are available within the respective MAS architecture. Two issues have to be addressed in this module: The relevant parts of the provider profile have to be retrieved without compromising the users privacy, and the recommendations have to be propagated in a privacy-preserving way. Our solution is based on a threat model in which no main abstract entity may safely assume any other abstract entity to act in an honest manner: Each entity has to assume that other entities may attempt to obtain private information, either while following the specified protocol or even by deviating from the protocol. According to [15], we classify the former case as honest-but-curious behavior (as an example, the TFE may propagate recommendations as specified, but may additionally attempt to propagate private information), and the latter case as malicious behavior (as an example, the filter may attempt to propagate private information instead of the recommendations). 4.2.1 Retrieving the Provider Profile As outlined above, the relay agent relays data between the TFE agent and the provider agent. These agents are not allowed to communicate directly, because the TFE agent cannot be assumed to act in an honest manner. Unlike the user profile, which is usually rather small, the provider profile is often too voluminous to be propagated as a whole efficiently. A typical example is a user profile containing ratings of about 100 movies, while the provider profile contains some 10,000 movies. Retrieving only the relevant part of the provider profile, however, is problematic because it has to be done without leaking sensitive information about the user profile. Therefore, the relay agent has to analyze all queries on the provider profile, and reject potentially critical queries, such as queries containing a set of user profile items. Because the propagation of single unlinkable user profile items is assumed to be uncritical, we extend the information filtering protocol as follows: The relevant parts of the provider profile are retrieved based on single anonymous interactions between the relay and the provider. If the MAS architecture used for the implementation does not provide an infrastructure for anonymous agent communication, this feature has to be provided explicitly: The most straightforward way is to use additional relay agents deployed via 322 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Table 1: The basic information filtering protocol with participants U = user agent, P = provider agent, F = TFE agent, R = relay agent, based on the abstract protocol shown in Figure 1. UP denotes the user profile with UP = {up1, .., upn}, PP denotes the provider profile, and REC denotes the set of recommendations with REC = {rec1, .., recm}. Phase. Sender → Message or Action Step Receiver 1.1 R → F establish control 1.2 U → R UP 1.3 R → F UP 2.1 P → R, F establish control 2.2 P → R PP 2.3 R → F PP 3.1 F → R REC 3.2 R → P REC 3.3 P → U REC 3.4 R → F terminate F 3.5 P → R terminate R the main relay agent and used once for a single anonymous interaction. Obviously, unlinkability is only achieved if multiple instances of the protocol are executed simultaneously between the provider and different users. Because agents on controlled platforms are unable to communicate anonymously with the respective controlling agent, control has to be established after the anonymous interactions have been completed. To prevent the uncontrolled relay agents from propagating provider profile data, the respective data is encrypted and the key is provided only after control has been established. Therefore, the second phase of the protocol described in Table 1 is replaced as described in Table 2. Additionally, the relay agent may allow other interactions as long as no user profile items are used within the queries. In this case, the relay agent has to ensure that the provider does not obtain any information exceeding the information deducible via the recommendations themselves. The clusterbased filtering technique described in Section 4.3 is an example for a filtering technique operating in this manner. 4.2.2 Recommendation Propagation The propagation of the recommendations is even more problematic mainly because more participants are involved: Recommendations have to be propagated from the TFE agent via the relay and provider agent to the user agent. No participant should be able to alter the recommendations or use them for the propagation of private information. Therefore, every participant in this chain has to obtain and verify the recommendations in unencrypted form prior to the next agent in the chain, i.e. the relay agent has to verify the recommendations before the provider obtains them, and so on. Therefore, the final phase of the protocol described in Table 1 is replaced as described in Table 3. It basically consists of two parts (Step 3.1 to 3.4, and Step 3.5 to Step 3.8), each of which provide a solution for a problem related to the prisoners problem [22], in which two participants (the prisoners) intend to exchange a message via a third, untrusted participant (the warden) who may read the message but must not be able to alter it in an undetectable manner. There are various solutions for protocols addressing the prisoners probTable 2: The updated second stage of the information filtering protocol with definitions as above.

The more obvious of these, however, such as protocols based on the use of digital signatures, introduce additional threats e.g. via the possibility of additional subliminal channels [22]. In order to minimize the risk of possible threats, we have decided to use a protocol that only requires a symmetric encryption scheme. The first part of the final phase is carried out as follows: In order to prevent the relay from altering recommendations, they are propagated by the filter together with an encrypted hash in Step 3.1. Thus, the relay is able to verify the recommendations before they are propagated further. The relay, however, may suspect the data propagated as the encrypted hash to contain private information instead of the actual hash value. Therefore, the encrypted hash is encrypted again and propagated together with a hash on the respective key in Step 3.2. In Step 3.3, the key KP F is revealed to the relay, allowing the relay to validate the encrypted hash. In Step 3.4, the key KR is revealed to the provider, allowing the provider to decrypt the data received in Step 3.2 and thus to obtain H(REC). Propagating the hash of the key KR prevents the relay from altering the recommendations to REC after Step 3.3, which would be undetectable otherwise because the relay could choose a key KR so that {{H(REC)}KPF }KR = {{H(REC )}KPF }KR . The encryption scheme used for encrypting the hash has to be secure against known-plaintext attacks, because otherwise the relay may be able to obtain KP F after Step 3.1 and subsequently alter the recommendations in an undetectable The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 323 way. Additionally, the encryption scheme must not be commutative for similar reasons. The remaining protocol steps are interactions between relay, provider and user agent. The interactions of Step 3.5 to Step 3.8 ensure, via the same mechanisms used in Step 3.1 to 3.4, that the provider is able to analyze the recommendations before the user obtains them, but at the same time prevent the provider from altering the recommendations. Additionally, the recommendations are not processed at once, but rather one at a time, to prevent the provider from withholding all recommendations. Upon completion of the protocol, both user and provider have obtained a set of recommendations. If the user wants these recommendations to be unlinkable to himself, the user agent has to carry out the entire protocol anonymously. Again, the most straightforward way to achieve this is to use additional relay agents deployed via the user agent which are used once for a single information filtering process. 4.3 Exemplary Filtering Techniques The filtering technique applied by the TFE agent cannot be chosen freely: All collaboration-based approaches, such as collaborative filtering techniques based on the profiles of a set of users, are not applicable because the provider profile does not contain user profile data (unless this data has been collected externally). Instead, these approaches are realized via the Matchmaker Module, which is outside the scope of this paper. Learning-based approaches are not applicable because the TFE agent cannot propagate any acquired data to the filter, which effectively means that the filter is incapable of learning. Filtering techniques that are actually applicable are feature-based approaches, such as content-based filtering (in which profile items are compared via their attributes) and knowledge-based filtering (in which domain-specific knowledge is applied in order to match user and provider profile items). An overview of different classes and hybrid combinations of filtering techniques is given in [5]. We have implemented two generic content-based filtering approaches that are applicable within our approach: A direct content-based filtering technique based on the class of item-based top-N recommendation algorithms [9] is used in cases where the user profile contains items that are also contained in the provider profile. In a preprocessing stage, i.e. prior to the actual information filtering processes, a model is generated containing the k most similar items for each provider profile item. While computationally rather complex, this approach is feasible because it has to be done only once, and it is carried out in a privacy-preserving way via interactions between the provider agent and a TFE agent. The resulting model is stored by the provider agent and can be seen as an additional part of the provider profile. In the actual information filtering process, the k most similar items are retrieved for each single user profile item via queries on the model (as described in Section 4.2.1, this is possible in a privacy-preserving way via anonymous communication). Recommendations are generated by selecting the n most frequent items from the result sets that are not already contained within the user profile. As an alternative approach applicable when the user profile contains information in addition to provider profile items, we provide a cluster-based approach in which provider profile items are clustered in a preprocessing stage via an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach. Each cluster is represented by a centroid item, and the cluster elements are either sub-clusters or, on the lowest level, the items themselves. In the information filtering stage, the relevant items are retrieved by descending through the cluster hierarchy in the following manner: The cluster items of the highest level are retrieved independent of the user profile. By comparing these items with the user profile data, the most relevant sub-clusters are determined and retrieved in a subsequent iteration. This process is repeated until the lowest level is reached, which contains the items themselves as recommendations. Throughout the process, user profile items are never propagated to the provider as such. The information deducible about the user profile does not exceed the information deducible via the recommendations themselves (because essentially only a chain of cluster centroids leading to the recommendations is retrieved), and therefore it is not regarded as privacy-critical. 4.4 Implementation We have implemented the approach for privacy-preserving IF based on JIAC IV [12], a FIPA-compliant MAS architecture. JIAC IV integrates fundamental aspects of autonomous agents regarding pro-activeness, intelligence, communication capabilities and mobility by providing a scalable component-based architecture. Additionally, JIAC IV offers components realizing management and security functionality, and provides a methodology for Agent-Oriented Software Engineering. JIAC IV stands out among MAS architectures as the only security-certified architecture, since it has been certified by the German Federal Office for Information Security according to the EAL3 of the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security standard [14]. JIAC IV offers several security features in the areas of access control for agent services, secure communication between agents, and low-level security based on Java security policies [21], and thus provides all security-related functionality required for our approach. We have extended the JIAC IV architecture by adding the mechanisms for communication control described in Section 4.1. Regarding the issue of malicious hosts, we currently assume all providers of agent platforms to be trusted. We are additionally developing a solution that is actually based on a trusted computing infrastructure. 5. EVALUATION For the evaluation of our approach, we have examined whether and to which extent the requirements (mainly regarding privacy, performance, and quality) are actually met. Privacy aspects are directly addressed by the modules and protocols described above and therefore not evaluated further here. Performance is a critical issue, mainly because of the overhead caused by creating additional agents and agent platforms for controlling communication, and by the additional interactions within the Recommender Module. Overall, a single information filtering process takes about ten times longer than a non-privacy-preserving information filtering process leading to the same results, which is a considerable overhead but still acceptable under certain conditions, as described in the following section. 5.1 The Smart Event Assistant As a proof of concept, and in order to evaluate performance and quality under real-life conditions, we have ap324 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) Figure 2: The Smart Event Assistant, a privacypreserving Recommender System supporting users in planning entertainment-related activities. plied our approach within the Smart Event Assistant, a MAS-based Recommender System which integrates various personalized services for entertainment planning in different German cities, such as a restaurant finder and a movie finder [25]. Additional services, such as a calendar, a routing service and news services complement the information services. An intelligent day planner integrates all functionality by providing personalized recommendations for the various information services, based on the users preferences and taking into account the location of the user as well as the potential venues. All services are accessible via mobile devices as well3 . Figure 2 shows a screenshot of the intelligent day planners result dialog. The Smart Event Assistant is entirely realized as a MAS system providing, among other functionality, various filter agents and different service provider agents, which together with the user agents utilize the functionality provided by our approach. Recommendations are generated in two ways: A push service delivers new recommendations to the user in regular intervals (e.g. once per day) via email or SMS. Because the user is not online during these interactions, they are less critical with regard to performance and the protracted duration of the information filtering process is acceptable in this case. Recommendations generated for the intelligent day planner, however, have to be delivered with very little latency because the process is triggered by the user, who expects to receive results promptly. In this scenario, the overall performance is substantially improved by setting up the relay agent and the TFE agent oﬄine, i.e. prior to the users request, and by an efficient retrieval of the relevant 3 The Smart Event Assistant may be accessed online via http://www.smarteventassistant.de.

Because these additional parameters are not seen as privacy-critical (as they are not based on the user profile, but rather constitute a short-term information need), the relevant part of the provider profile may be propagated as a whole, with no need for complex interactions. Taken together, these improvements result in a filtering process that takes about three times as long as the respective nonprivacy-preserving filtering process, which we regard as an acceptable trade-off for the increased level of privacy. Table 4 shows the results of the performance evaluation in more detail. In these scenarios, a direct content-based filtering technique similar to the one described in Section 4.3 is applied. Because equivalent filtering techniques have been applied successfully in regular Recommender Systems [9], there are no negative consequences with regard to the quality of the recommendations. 5.2 Alternative Approaches As described in Section 3.2, our solution is based on trusted computing. There are more straightforward ways to realize privacy-preserving IF, e.g. by utilizing a centralized architecture in which the privacy-preserving providerside functionality is realized as trusted software based on trusted computing. However, we consider these approaches to be unsuitable because they are far less generic: Whenever some part of the respective software is patched, upgraded or replaced, the entire system has to be analyzed again in order to determine its trustworthiness, a process that is problematic in itself due to its complexity. In our solution, only a comparatively small part of the overall system is based on trusted computing. Because agent platforms can be utilized for a large variety of tasks, and because we see trusted computing as the most promising approach to realize secure and trusted agent environments, it seems reasonable to assume that these respective mechanisms will be generally available in the future, independent of specific solutions such as the one described here.

CONCLUSION & FURTHER WORK We have developed an agent-based approach for privacypreserving Recommender Systems. By utilizing fundamental features of agents such as autonomy, adaptability and the ability to communicate, by extending the capabilities of agent platform managers regarding control of agent communication, by providing a privacy-preserving protocol for information filtering processes, and by utilizing suitable filtering techniques we have been able to realize an approach which actually preserves privacy in Information Filtering architectures in a multilateral way. As a proof of concept, we have used the approach within an application supporting users in planning entertainment-related activities. We envision various areas of future work: To achieve complete user privacy, the protocol should be extended in order to keep the recommendations themselves private as well. Generally, the feedback we have obtained from users of the Smart Event Assistant indicates that most users are indifferent to privacy in the context of entertainment-related personal information. Therefore, we intend to utilize the approach to realize a Recommender System in a more privacysensitive domain, such as health or finance, which would enable us to better evaluate user acceptance. 7.

La capacidad de preservar la privacidad de todos los participantes es un requisito esencial de las arquitecturas de filtrado de información subyacentes, porque los sistemas de recomendación implementados deben ser aceptados por los usuarios conscientes de la privacidad, así como los proveedores de información y servicios. Los enfoques existentes descuidan abordar la privacidad de esta manera multilateral. Hemos desarrollado un enfoque para los sistemas de recomendación de la privacidad basados en tecnología de sistemas de múltiples agentes que permite a las aplicaciones generar recomendaciones a través de diversas técnicas de filtrado al tiempo que preservan la privacidad de todos los participantes. Describimos los módulos principales de nuestra solución, así como una aplicación que hemos implementado en función de este enfoque.

Introducción Los sistemas de filtrado de información (IF) tienen como objetivo contrarrestar la sobrecarga de información extrayendo información relevante para un usuario determinado de un gran cuerpo de información disponible a través de un proveedor de información. A diferencia de los sistemas de recuperación de información (IR), donde la información relevante se extrae en función de las consultas de búsqueda, si las arquitecturas generan información personalizada basada en perfiles de usuario que contienen, para cada usuario, datos personales, preferencias y elementos calificados. El cuerpo de información proporcionado generalmente está estructurado y recopilado en los perfiles de proveedores. Las técnicas de filtrado funcionan en estos perfiles para generar recomendaciones de elementos que probablemente sean relevantes para un usuario dado, o para determinar a los usuarios con intereses similares, o ambos. Dependiendo del objetivo respectivo, los sistemas resultantes constituyen sistemas de recomendación [5], sistemas de emparejadores [10] o una combinación de los mismos. El aspecto de la privacidad es un problema esencial en todos los sistemas IF: la generación de información personalizada obviamente requiere el uso de datos personales. De acuerdo con las encuestas que indican importantes preocupaciones de privacidad de los usuarios en el contexto de los sistemas de recomendación y el comercio electrónico en general [23], se puede esperar que los usuarios sean menos reacios a proporcionar información personal si confían en el sistema para que se presente la privacidad con respecto ainformación personal. Consideraciones similares también se aplican al proveedor de información, que puede querer controlar la difusión de la información proporcionada y al proveedor de las técnicas de filtrado, que pueden no querer que los detalles de los algoritmos de filtrado utilizados se conviertan en conocimiento común. Por lo tanto, una preservación de la privacidad si el sistema debe equilibrar estos requisitos y proteger la privacidad de todas las partes involucradas de manera multilateral, al tiempo que aborda los requisitos generales con respecto al rendimiento, la seguridad y la calidad de las recomendaciones. Como se describe en la siguiente sección, hay varios enfoques con objetivos similares, pero ninguno de estos proporciona un enfoque genérico en el que se conserva la privacidad de todas las partes. Hemos desarrollado un enfoque basado en agentes para la privacidad de la privacidad si se ha utilizado para realizar un sistema combinado de recomendación/emparejador como parte de una aplicación que apoya a los usuarios en la planificación de actividades relacionadas con el entretenimiento. En este artículo, nos centramos en la funcionalidad del sistema de recomendación. Nuestro enfoque se basa en la tecnología del sistema múltiple (MAS) porque las características fundamentales de agentes como la autonomía, la adaptabilidad y la capacidad de comunicarse son requisitos esenciales de nuestro enfoque. En otras palabras, el enfoque realizado no constituye simplemente una solución para la preservación de la privacidad si está dentro de un contexto MAS, sino que utiliza una arquitectura MAS para realizar una solución para la preservación de la privacidad, que no podría realizarse fácilmente de otra manera. El documento está estructurado de la siguiente manera: la Sección 2 describe el trabajo relacionado. La Sección 3 describe las ideas generales de nuestro enfoque. En la Sección 4, describimos detalles esenciales de los 319 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 módulos Ifaamas de nuestro enfoque y su implementación. En la Sección 5, evaluamos el enfoque, principalmente a través de la aplicación realizada. La Sección 6 concluye el documento con una perspectiva y describe más trabajo.2. Trabajo relacionado Hay una gran cantidad de trabajo en áreas relacionadas, como la recuperación de información privada [7], la minería de datos de preservación de la privacidad [2] y otros protocolos de preservación de la privacidad [4, 16], la mayoría de los cuales se basa en seguroComputación multipartidista [27]. Hemos descartado los enfoques seguros de cálculo multipartidista principalmente debido a su complejidad, y porque el algoritmo que se calcula de forma segura no se considera privado en estos enfoques. Se han sugerido varios mecanismos de cumplimiento que son aplicables en el contexto del filtrado de información que presenta la privacidad, como las políticas de privacidad empresarial [17] o las bases de datos hipocráticas [1], de las cuales anotan datos de usuarios con metainformación adicional especificando cómo son los datosser manejado en el lado del proveedor. Estos enfoques finalmente suponen que el proveedor realmente tiene la intención de proteger la privacidad de los datos del usuario y ofrece soporte para esta tarea, pero no pretenden evitar que el proveedor actúe de manera maliciosa. La informática de confianza, según lo especificado por el grupo informático de confianza, tiene como objetivo realizar sistemas confiables al aumentar la seguridad de los sistemas abiertos a un nivel comparable con el nivel de seguridad que se puede lograr en los sistemas cerrados. Se basa en una combinación de hardware a prueba de tamper y varios componentes de software. Algunas aplicaciones de ejemplo, incluidas las redes entre pares, los firewalls distribuidos y la computación distribuida en general, se enumeran en [13]. Existen algunos enfoques para los sistemas de recomendación de preservación de la privacidad basados en el filtrado colaborativo distribuido, en los que se generan recomendaciones a través de un modelo público que agregue los perfiles de usuario distribuidos sin contener información explícita sobre los perfiles de usuarios. Esto se logra a través de un cálculo seguro multipartidista [6], o mediante perturbación aleatoria de los datos del usuario [20]. En [19], varios enfoques se integran dentro de una sola arquitectura. En [10], se describe un enfoque basado en agentes en el que los agentes de usuarios que representan usuarios similares se descubren a través de un recorrido transitivo de los agentes de los usuarios. La privacidad se conserva a través de la interacción seudónima entre los agentes y mediante la adición de datos de información a la información personal. Enfoques relacionados más recientes se describen en [18]. En [3], se describe una arquitectura basada en agentes para el filtrado demográfico que presenta la privacidad que puede generalizarse para respaldar otros tipos de técnicas de filtrado. Si bien en algunos aspectos similares a nuestro enfoque, esta arquitectura aborda al menos dos aspectos de manera inadecuada, a saber, la protección del filtro contra los intentos de manipulación y la prevención de colusiones entre el filtro y el proveedor.3. El filtrado de información de preservación de la privacidad identificamos tres entidades abstractas principales que participan en un proceso de filtrado de información dentro de un sistema distribuido: una entidad de usuario, una entidad del proveedor y una entidad de filtro. Mientras que en algunas aplicaciones el proveedor y las entidades de filtro confían explícitamente entre sí, debido a que la misma parte implementan las mismas, nuestra solución es aplicable de manera más genérica porque no requiere ninguna confianza entre las principales entidades abstractas. En este documento, nos centramos en aspectos relacionados con el proceso de filtrado de información en sí, y omitimos todos los aspectos relacionados con la recopilación y el procesamiento de la información, es decir, las etapas en las que se generan y mantienen los perfiles, principalmente porque estas etapas son menos críticas con respecto a la privacidad,ya que involucran menos entidades diferentes.3.1 Requisitos Nuestra solución apunta a cumplir con los siguientes requisitos con respecto a la privacidad: • Privacidad del usuario: no hay información vinculable sobre los perfiles de usuario debe ser adquirida permanentemente por cualquier otra entidad o parte externa, incluidas otras entidades de usuario. Sin embargo, los elementos de perfil de usuario único se pueden adquirir permanentemente si no son sincronizables, es decir, si no pueden atribuirse a un usuario específico o vincularse a otros elementos de perfil de usuario. También se permite la adquisición temporal de información privada. Los conjuntos de recomendaciones pueden ser adquiridos permanentemente por el proveedor, pero no deben ser vinculables a un usuario específico. Estas concesiones simplifican el protocolo resultante y permiten que el proveedor obtenga recomendaciones y elementos de perfil de usuario no unkinkables, y por lo tanto determinar la información solicitada con frecuencia y optimizar la información ofrecida en consecuencia.• Privacidad del proveedor: ninguna información sobre los perfiles del proveedor, con la excepción de las recomendaciones, debe ser adquirida permanentemente por otras entidades o partes externas. Nuevamente, se permite la adquisición temporal de información privada. Además, la propagación de la información del proveedor está completamente bajo el control del proveedor. Por lo tanto, el proveedor está habilitado para evitar un mal uso, como la extracción automática de información a gran escala.• Privacidad del filtro: los detalles de los algoritmos aplicados por las técnicas de filtrado no deben ser adquiridos permanentemente por ninguna otra entidad o parte externa. La entidad del filtro puede proporcionar información general sobre el algoritmo para ayudar a otras entidades a tomar una decisión sobre si aplicar la técnica de filtrado respectiva. Además, los requisitos generales con respecto a la calidad de las recomendaciones, así como los aspectos de seguridad, el rendimiento y la amplitud del sistema resultante también deben abordarse. Si bien las compensaciones menores pueden ser aceptables, el sistema resultante debe alcanzar un nivel similar a los sistemas de recomendación regulares con respecto a estos requisitos.3.2 Esquema de la solución La idea básica para realizar un protocolo que cumple con estos requisitos relacionados con la privacidad en los sistemas de recomendación está implícito al permitir la adquisición temporal de información privada (ver [8] para el enfoque original): la entidad del usuario y el proveedor propagan los respectivosDatos de perfil a la entidad del filtro. La entidad del filtro proporciona las recomendaciones y posteriormente elimina toda la información privada, cumpliendo así el requisito con respecto a la adquisición permanente de información privada.320 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07), las entidades cuya información privada se propagan deben estar seguros de que la información respectiva se adquiere realmente temporalmente solo. La confianza a este respecto puede establecerse de dos maneras principales: • Software de confianza: se confía en la entidad respectiva en sí misma para eliminar la información respectiva como se especifica.• Entorno de confianza: la entidad respectiva opera en un entorno en el que se confía en la comunicación y el ciclo de vida de la entidad hasta cierto punto en que la eliminación de la información respectiva puede lograrse independientemente de las acciones intentadas de la entidad misma. Además, se confía en el entorno en sí para no actuar de manera maliciosa (por ejemplo, se confía en no adquirir y propagar la información respectiva en sí). En ambos casos, la confianza puede establecerse de varias maneras. Se pueden utilizar mecanismos basados en la reputación, terceros de confianza adicionales que certificaran entidades o entornos, o mecanismos informáticos de confianza. Nuestro enfoque se basa en un entorno confiable realizado a través de mecanismos informáticos de confianza, porque vemos esta solución como el enfoque más genérico y realista. Esta decisión se discute brevemente en la Sección 5. Ahora podemos especificar el protocolo de filtrado de información abstracta como se muestra en la Figura 1: la entidad del filtro implementa una entidad de filtro temporal (TFE) que funciona en un entorno confiable. La entidad de usuario implementa una entidad de retransmisión adicional que opera en el mismo entorno. A través de los mecanismos proporcionados por este entorno, la entidad de retransmisión puede controlar la comunicación de la TFE, y la entidad del proveedor puede controlar la comunicación de la entidad de retransmisión y el TFE. Por lo tanto, es posible asegurarse de que las entidades controladas solo puedan propagar recomendaciones, pero ninguna otra información privada. En la primera etapa (pasos 1.1 a 1.3 de la Figura 1), la entidad de retransmisión establece el control de la TFE y, por lo tanto, evita que propague la información del perfil de usuario. Los datos del perfil de usuario se propagan sin participar en la entidad del proveedor de la entidad de usuario a la TFE a través de la entidad de retransmisión. En la segunda etapa (pasos 2.1 a 2.3 de la Figura 1), la entidad del proveedor establece el control de Relay y TFE, y así evita que propagen la información del perfil del proveedor. Los datos del perfil del proveedor se propagan desde la entidad del proveedor a la TFE a través de la entidad de retransmisión. En la tercera etapa (pasos 3.1 a 3.5 de la Figura 1), el TFE devuelve las recomendaciones a través de la entidad de retransmisión, y las entidades controladas terminan. Tomados en conjunto, estos pasos se aseguran de que toda la información privada sea adquirida temporalmente solo por las otras entidades principales. En la siguiente sección se discuten los problemas de determinar consultas aceptables en el perfil del proveedor y garantizar la desintegración de las recomendaciones. Nuestro enfoque requiere que cada entidad en la arquitectura distribuida tenga las siguientes cinco habilidades principales: la capacidad de realizar ciertas tareas bien definidas (como llevar a cabo un proceso de filtrado) con un alto grado de autonomía, es decir, en gran medida independiente de otras entidades (p. Ej.Debido a que la entidad respectiva no puede comunicarse de manera sin restricciones), la capacidad de ser desplegable dinámicamente en un entorno bien definido, la capacidad de comunicarse con otras entidades, la capacidad de lograr la protección contra los intentos de manipulación externos y la capacidad decontrolar y restringir la comunicación de otras entidades. Figura 1: El protocolo de filtrado de información de preservación de la privacidad abstracta. Toda la comunicación en los entornos indicados por líneas discontinuas se evita con la excepción de la comunicación con la entidad controladora. Las arquitecturas MAS son una solución ideal para realizar un sistema distribuido caracterizado por estas características, ya que proporcionan a los agentes que constituyen entidades que en realidad se caracterizan por la autonomía, la movilidad y la capacidad de comunicarse [26], así como a las plataformas de agentes como entornos que proporcionan medios para realizar medios para realizar medios para realizarLa seguridad de los agentes. En este contexto, el tema de los hosts maliciosos, es decir, los anfitriones de los agentes atacantes, debe abordarse explícitamente. Además, las arquitecturas MAS existentes generalmente no permiten que los agentes controlen la comunicación de otros agentes. Sin embargo, es posible expandir una arquitectura MAS y proporcionar a los agentes designados esta capacidad. Por estas razones, nuestra solución se basa en una arquitectura MAS de FIPA [11]. Las entidades introducidas anteriormente se asignan directamente a los agentes, y el entorno confiable en el que existen se realiza en forma de plataformas de agentes. Además de la arquitectura MAS en sí, que se supone como se da, nuestra solución consta de los siguientes cinco módulos principales: • El módulo controlador descrito en la Sección 4.1 proporciona funcionalidad para controlar las capacidades de comunicación de los agentes.• El módulo de persistencia transparente facilita el uso de diferentes mecanismos de almacenamiento de datos y proporciona una interfaz uniforme para acceder a información persistente, que puede utilizarse para monitorear interacciones críticas que involucren información potencialmente privada, p.como parte de las consultas. Su descripción está fuera del alcance de este documento.• El módulo de recomendación, cuyos detalles se describen en la Sección 4.2, proporciona la funcionalidad del sistema de recomendación.• El módulo Matchmaker proporciona la funcionalidad del sistema Matchmaker. Además, utiliza aspectos sociales de la tecnología MAS. Su descripción está fuera del alcance de este documento. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 321 • Finalmente, un módulo separado descrito en la Sección 4.4 proporciona técnicas de filtrado ejemplares para mostrar que se pueden cumplir varias restricciones impuestas a las técnicas de filtrado por nuestro enfoque. El entorno confiable introducido anteriormente abarca la arquitectura MAS misma y el módulo controlador, en el que se debe confiar para actuar de manera no maliciosa para descartar la posibilidad de hosts maliciosos.4. Módulos principales e implementación En esta sección, describimos los módulos principales de nuestro enfoque y describimos la implementación. Si bien hemos elegido una arquitectura específica para la implementación, la especificación del módulo es aplicable a cualquier arquitectura MAS compatible con FIPA. Un módulo básicamente abarca ontologías, funcionalidad proporcionada por los agentes a través de servicios de agentes y funcionalidad interna. A lo largo de este documento, {M} KX denota un mensaje M encriptado a través de un esquema de cifrado simétrico no especificado con una clave secreta KX utilizada para el cifrado y el descifrado que inicialmente se conoce solo por el participante X. Una clave KXY es una clave compartida por los participantes x e y. Se usa una función de hash criptográfica en varios puntos del protocolo, es decir, una función que devuelve un valor hash h (x) para los datos dados x que es a la vez resistente a la preimagen y a la colisión resistente1. Denotamos un conjunto de valores hash para un conjunto de datos x = {x1, .., xn} como h (x) = {h (x1), .., h (xn)}, mientras que h (x) denota un solovalor hash de un conjunto de datos.4.1 Módulo del controlador Como se señaló anteriormente, la capacidad de controlar la comunicación de los agentes generalmente no es una característica de las arquitecturas MAS existentes2, sino al mismo tiempo un requisito central de nuestro enfoque para el filtrado de información que presenta la privacidad. La funcionalidad requerida no puede realizarse en función de los servicios o componentes regulares de agentes, porque un agente en una plataforma generalmente no puede interferir con las acciones de otros agentes de ninguna manera. Por lo tanto, agregamos infraestructura adicional que proporciona la funcionalidad requerida a la arquitectura MAS misma, lo que resulta en un entorno de agente con funcionalidad y responsabilidades extendidas. El control de las capacidades de comunicación de un agente se realiza restringiendo a través de reglas, de manera similar a un firewall, pero con el consentimiento del agente respectivo, su comunicación entrante y saliente con plataformas o agentes específicos en plataformas externas, así como otras posibles comunicación de comunicación.canales, como el sistema de archivos. Se requiere consentimiento porque de lo contrario la seguridad general se vería comprometida, ya que los atacantes podrían bloquear arbitrariamente varios canales de comunicación. Nuestro enfoque no requiere controlar la comunicación entre los agentes en la misma plataforma y, por lo tanto, este aspecto no se aborda. En consecuencia, todas las reglas que abordan las capacidades de comunicación deben aplicarse en plataformas enteras, porque de lo contrario un agente controlado podría usar un agente no controlado 1 en la implementación, hemos utilizado el estándar de cifrado avanzado (AES) como esquema de cifrado simétrico y SHA-1 como la función de hash criptográfico.2 Una encuesta reciente sobre entornos de agentes [24] concluye que los aspectos relacionados con los entornos de los agentes a menudo se descuidan y no indica ningún trabajo existente en esta área en particular.en la misma plataforma que un relé para comunicarse con agentes que residen en plataformas externas. Varios servicios de agentes proporcionan funcionalidad para agregar y revocar el control de las plataformas, incluida la funcionalidad requerida en escenarios complejos donde los agentes controlados a su vez controlan otras plataformas. La implementación del mecanismo de control real depende de la arquitectura MAS real. En nuestra implementación, hemos utilizado métodos proporcionados a través del gerente de seguridad de Java como parte del modelo de seguridad Java. Por lo tanto, el agente del supervisor está habilitado para definir políticas de seguridad personalizadas, otorgando así o negando a otros agentes el acceso a los recursos necesarios para la comunicación con otros agentes, así como la comunicación en general, como archivos o socios para la comunicación basada en TCP/IP.4.2 Módulo de recomendación El módulo de recomendación es el principal responsable de llevar a cabo procesos de filtrado de información, de acuerdo con el protocolo descrito en la Tabla 1. Las entidades participantes se realizan como agentes y las interacciones como servicios de agentes. Suponemos que los mecanismos para la comunicación de agentes seguros están disponibles dentro de la arquitectura MAS respectiva. Se deben abordar dos problemas en este módulo: las partes relevantes del perfil del proveedor deben recuperarse sin comprometer la privacidad del usuarios, y las recomendaciones deben propagarse de manera que presente la privacidad. Nuestra solución se basa en un modelo de amenaza en el que ninguna entidad abstracta principal puede asumir con seguridad cualquier otra entidad abstracta para actuar de manera honesta: cada entidad debe asumir que otras entidades pueden intentar obtener información privada, ya sea mientras sigue el protocolo especificado oIncluso desviándose del protocolo. Según [15], clasificamos el primer caso como un comportamiento honesto pero curioso (como ejemplo, el TFE puede propagar las recomendaciones como se especifica, pero además puede intentar propagar información privada), y el último caso como comportamiento malicioso (comoUn ejemplo, el filtro puede intentar propagar información privada en lugar de las recomendaciones).4.2.1 Recuperando el perfil del proveedor como se describe anteriormente, el agente de retransmisión transmite datos entre el agente TFE y el agente del proveedor. A estos agentes no pueden comunicarse directamente, porque no se puede suponer que el agente de TFE actúe de manera honesta. A diferencia del perfil de usuario, que generalmente es bastante pequeño, el perfil del proveedor a menudo es demasiado voluminoso para ser propagado como un todo de manera eficiente. Un ejemplo típico es un perfil de usuario que contiene calificaciones de aproximadamente 100 películas, mientras que el perfil del proveedor contiene unas 10,000 películas. Sin embargo, recuperar solo la parte relevante del perfil del proveedor es problemático porque debe hacerse sin filtrar información confidencial sobre el perfil de usuario. Por lo tanto, el agente de retransmisión tiene que analizar todas las consultas en el perfil del proveedor y rechazar consultas potencialmente críticas, como consultas que contienen un conjunto de elementos de perfil de usuario. Debido a que se supone que la propagación de elementos de perfil de usuario no unkinables no es críticos, ampliamos el protocolo de filtrado de información de la siguiente manera: las partes relevantes del perfil del proveedor se recuperan en función de las interacciones anónimas individuales entre el relé y el proveedor. Si la arquitectura MAS utilizada para la implementación no proporciona una infraestructura para la comunicación de agentes anónimos, esta característica debe proporcionarse explícitamente: la forma más directa es usar agentes de retransmisión adicionales implementados a través de 322 el sexto intl. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Tabla 1: El protocolo básico de filtrado de información con los participantes u = agente de usuario, p = agente de proveedores, f = agente tfe, r = agente de retransmisión, basado en el protocolo abstracto en la figura1. Up denota el perfil de usuario con up = {up1, .., upn}, pp denota el perfil del proveedor, y REC denota el conjunto de recomendaciones con rec = {rec1, .., recm}. Remitente → Mensaje o paso de acción receptor 1.1 R → F Establecer control 1.2 U → R Up 1.3 R → F Up 2.1 P → R, F Establecer control 2.2 P → R PP 2.3 R → F PP 3.1 F → R Rec 3.2 R →REC 3.3 P → U REC 3.4 R → F Terminar F 3.5 P → R Terminar R El agente de retransmisión principal y usado una vez para una sola interacción anónima. Obviamente, la desintegración solo se logra si múltiples instancias del protocolo se ejecutan simultáneamente entre el proveedor y los diferentes usuarios. Debido a que los agentes en plataformas controladas no pueden comunicarse de forma anónima con el agente controlador respectivo, el control debe establecerse después de que se hayan completado las interacciones anónimas. Para evitar que los agentes de retransmisión no controlados propagen los datos del perfil del proveedor, los datos respectivos están encriptados y la clave se proporciona solo después de que se haya establecido el control. Por lo tanto, la segunda fase del protocolo descrito en la Tabla 1 se reemplaza como se describe en la Tabla 2. Además, el agente de retransmisión puede permitir otras interacciones siempre que no se usen elementos de perfil de usuario dentro de las consultas. En este caso, el agente de retransmisión debe asegurarse de que el proveedor no obtenga ninguna información que exceda el deducible de la información a través de las recomendaciones mismas. La técnica de filtrado basada en clúster descrita en la Sección 4.3 es un ejemplo para una técnica de filtrado que funciona de esta manera.4.2.2 Propagación de recomendación La propagación de las recomendaciones es aún más problemática principalmente porque hay más participantes involucrados: las recomendaciones deben propagarse del agente TFE a través del agente de relé y proveedor al agente de usuarios. Ningún participante debe poder alterar las recomendaciones o usarlas para la propagación de información privada. Por lo tanto, cada participante en esta cadena tiene que obtener y verificar las recomendaciones en forma no cifrada antes del siguiente agente en la cadena, es decir, el agente de retransmisión debe verificar las recomendaciones antes de que el proveedor las obtenga, y así sucesivamente. Por lo tanto, la fase final del protocolo descrito en la Tabla 1 se reemplaza como se describe en la Tabla 3. Básicamente consta de dos partes (paso 3.1 a 3.4, y el paso 3.5 al paso 3.8), cada una de las cuales proporciona una solución para un problema relacionado con el problema de los prisioneros [22], en el que dos participantes (los prisioneros) tienen la intención de intercambiar unMensaje a través de un tercer participante no confiable (el Guardián) que puede leer el mensaje pero que no debe poder alterarlo de manera indetectable. Existen varias soluciones para protocolos que abordan la probable de prisioneros 2: la segunda etapa actualizada del protocolo de filtrado de información con las definiciones como se indicó anteriormente.

Sin embargo, los más obvios de estos, como los protocolos basados en el uso de firmas digitales, introducen amenazas adicionales, p.a través de la posibilidad de canales subliminales adicionales [22]. Para minimizar el riesgo de posibles amenazas, hemos decidido usar un protocolo que solo requiere un esquema de cifrado simétrico. La primera parte de la fase final se lleva a cabo de la siguiente manera: para evitar que el relé altere las recomendaciones, el filtro se propaga junto con un hash encriptado en el paso 3.1. Por lo tanto, el relé puede verificar las recomendaciones antes de que se propagan más. Sin embargo, el relé puede sospechar los datos propagados como el hash cifrado para contener información privada en lugar del valor hash real. Por lo tanto, el hash encriptado se encripta nuevamente y se propaga junto con un hash en la clave respectiva en el paso 3.2. En el paso 3.3, la clave KP F se revela al relé, lo que permite que el relé valida el hash cifrado. En el paso 3.4, la clave KR se revela al proveedor, lo que permite al proveedor descifrar los datos recibidos en el paso 3.2 y, por lo tanto, obtener h (rec). Propagar el hash de la clave KR evita que el retransmisión altere las recomendaciones a Rec después del paso 3.3, que sería indetectable de otra manera porque el relé podría elegir una clave KR para que {{h (rec)} kpf} kr = {{h (h (h (h (Rec)} kpf} kr. El esquema de cifrado utilizado para encriptar el hash debe ser seguro contra ataques conocidos-presumidos, porque de lo contrario el relé puede obtener KP F después del paso 3.1 y posteriormente alterar las recomendaciones en un sexto INTL indetectable. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 323 Way. Además, el esquema de cifrado no debe ser conmutativo por razones similares. Los pasos del protocolo restantes son las interacciones entre el retransmisión, el proveedor y el agente de usuario. Las interacciones del paso 3.5 al paso 3.8 aseguran, a través de los mismos mecanismos utilizados en el paso 3.1 a 3.4, que el proveedor puede analizar las recomendaciones antes de que el usuario las obtenga, pero al mismo tiempo evitar que el proveedor altere las recomendaciones. Además, las recomendaciones no se procesan a la vez, sino una a la vez, para evitar que el proveedor retenga todas las recomendaciones. Al finalizar el protocolo, tanto el usuario como el proveedor han obtenido un conjunto de recomendaciones. Si el usuario quiere que estas recomendaciones no sean iluminables para sí mismo, el agente del usuario debe llevar a cabo todo el protocolo de forma anónima. Nuevamente, la forma más directa de lograr esto es usar agentes de retransmisión adicionales implementados a través del agente de usuario que se usa una vez para un solo proceso de filtrado de información.4.3 Técnicas de filtrado ejemplares La técnica de filtrado aplicada por el agente TFE no se puede elegir libremente: no son aplicables todos los enfoques basados en colaboración, como las técnicas de filtrado de colaboración basado en los perfiles de un conjunto de usuarios porque el perfil del proveedor no contiene perfil de usuariodatos (a menos que estos datos se hayan recopilado externamente). En cambio, estos enfoques se realizan a través del módulo Matchmaker, que está fuera del alcance de este documento. Los enfoques basados en el aprendizaje no son aplicables porque el agente TFE no puede propagar ningún datos adquiridos al filtro, lo que significa efectivamente que el filtro es incapaz de aprender. Las técnicas de filtrado que realmente son aplicables son enfoques basados en características, como el filtrado basado en contenido (en el que los elementos de perfil se comparan a través de sus atributos) y el filtrado basado en el conocimiento (en el que se aplica el conocimiento específico del dominio para que coincida con el usuario y el proveedorElementos de perfil). En [5] se da una descripción general de diferentes clases y combinaciones híbridas de técnicas de filtrado. Hemos implementado dos enfoques de filtrado genéricos basados en contenido que son aplicables dentro de nuestro enfoque: una técnica de filtrado directa basada en contenido basada en la clase de algoritmos de recomendación de Top-N basados en elementos [9] se utiliza en los casos en que el perfil de usuario contiene elementosque también están contenidos en el perfil del proveedor. En una etapa de preprocesamiento, es decir, antes de los procesos de filtrado de información reales, se genera un modelo que contiene los elementos K más similares para cada elemento de perfil del proveedor. Si bien es computacionalmente bastante complejo, este enfoque es factible porque debe hacerse solo una vez, y se lleva a cabo de manera que preserva la privacidad a través de las interacciones entre el agente del proveedor y un agente de TFE. El agente del proveedor almacena el modelo resultante y puede verse como una parte adicional del perfil del proveedor. En el proceso de filtrado de información real, los k elementos más similares se recuperan para cada elemento de perfil de usuario único a través de consultas en el modelo (como se describe en la Sección 4.2.1, esto es posible de manera que presente la privacidad a través de la comunicación anónima). Las recomendaciones se generan seleccionando los n elementos más frecuentes de los conjuntos de resultados que aún no están contenidos en el perfil de usuario. Como un enfoque alternativo aplicable cuando el perfil de usuario contiene información además de los elementos de perfil del proveedor, proporcionamos un enfoque basado en clúster en el que los elementos del perfil del proveedor se agrupan en una etapa de preprocesamiento a través de un enfoque de agrupación jerárquica aglomerativa. Cada clúster está representado por un elemento centroide, y los elementos del clúster son subgregados o, en el nivel más bajo, los elementos mismos. En la etapa de filtrado de información, los elementos relevantes se recuperan descendiendo a través de la jerarquía del clúster de la siguiente manera: los elementos del clúster del nivel más alto se recuperan independientemente del perfil de usuario. Al comparar estos elementos con los datos del perfil del usuario, los subclusros más relevantes se determinan y se recuperan en una iteración posterior. Este proceso se repite hasta que se alcanza el nivel más bajo, que contiene los elementos mismos como recomendaciones. A lo largo del proceso, los elementos de perfil de usuario nunca se propagan al proveedor como tal. La información deducible sobre el perfil del usuario no excede la información deducible a través de las recomendaciones en sí mismas (porque esencialmente solo se recupera una cadena de centroides de clúster que conducen a las recomendaciones), y por lo tanto no se considera crítica de privacidad.4.4 Implementación Hemos implementado el enfoque para la preservación de la privacidad si se basa en JIAC IV [12], una arquitectura MAS que cumple con la FIPA. Jiac IV integra aspectos fundamentales de los agentes autónomos con respecto a la proactividad, la inteligencia, las capacidades de comunicación y la movilidad al proporcionar una arquitectura basada en componentes escalables. Además, JIAC IV ofrece componentes que realizan la funcionalidad de gestión y seguridad, y proporciona una metodología para la ingeniería de software orientada a los agentes. Jiac IV se destaca entre las arquitecturas MAS como la única arquitectura certificada por la seguridad, ya que ha sido certificada por la Oficina Federal Alemana de Seguridad de la Información de acuerdo con el EAL3 del estándar de seguridad de la tecnología de tecnología de la información [14]. JIAC IV ofrece varias características de seguridad en las áreas de control de acceso para servicios de agentes, comunicación segura entre agentes y seguridad de bajo nivel basada en políticas de seguridad de Java [21] y, por lo tanto, proporciona toda la funcionalidad relacionada con la seguridad requerida para nuestro enfoque. Hemos extendido la arquitectura JIAC IV agregando los mecanismos para el control de la comunicación descritos en la Sección 4.1. Con respecto al tema de los anfitriones maliciosos, actualmente asumimos que todos los proveedores de plataformas de agentes se deben confiar. También estamos desarrollando una solución que en realidad se basa en una infraestructura informática confiable.5. Evaluación para la evaluación de nuestro enfoque, hemos examinado si realmente se cumplen los requisitos (principalmente con respecto a la privacidad, el rendimiento y la calidad). Los aspectos de privacidad se abordan directamente por los módulos y protocolos descritos anteriormente y, por lo tanto, no se evalúan más aquí. El rendimiento es un problema crítico, principalmente debido a la sobrecarga causada por la creación de agentes y plataformas de agentes adicionales para controlar la comunicación, y por las interacciones adicionales dentro del módulo de recomendación. En general, un solo proceso de filtrado de información tarda aproximadamente diez veces más que un proceso de filtrado de información que no preserva la privacidad que conduce a los mismos resultados, que es una sobrecarga considerable pero aún aceptable bajo ciertas condiciones, como se describe en la siguiente sección.5.1 El asistente de evento inteligente como prueba de concepto, y para evaluar el rendimiento y la calidad en condiciones de la vida real, tenemos AP324 el sexto INTL. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) Figura 2: The Smart Event Assistant, un sistema de recomendación de privacidad que admite a los usuarios en la planificación de actividades relacionadas con el entretenimiento.Plisó nuestro enfoque dentro del Smart Event Assistant, un sistema de recomendación con sede en MAS que integra varios servicios personalizados para la planificación del entretenimiento en diferentes ciudades alemanas, como un buscador de restaurantes y un buscador de películas [25]. Los servicios adicionales, como un calendario, un servicio de enrutamiento y servicios de noticias complementan los servicios de información. Un planificador de día inteligente integra toda la funcionalidad al proporcionar recomendaciones personalizadas para los diversos servicios de información, según las preferencias de los usuarios y teniendo en cuenta la ubicación del usuario, así como los posibles lugares. Todos los servicios también son accesibles a través de dispositivos móviles3. La Figura 2 muestra una captura de pantalla del diálogo de resultados de los planificadores de día inteligentes. El asistente de eventos inteligentes se realiza por completo como un sistema MAS que proporciona, entre otras funcionalidades, varios agentes de filtro y diferentes agentes de proveedores de servicios, que junto con los agentes de los usuarios utilizan la funcionalidad proporcionada por nuestro enfoque. Las recomendaciones se generan de dos maneras: un servicio push ofrece nuevas recomendaciones al usuario en intervalos regulares (por ejemplo, una vez al día) por correo electrónico o SMS. Debido a que el usuario no está en línea durante estas interacciones, es menos crítico con respecto al rendimiento y la duración prolongada del proceso de filtrado de información es aceptable en este caso. Sin embargo, las recomendaciones generadas para el planificador de día inteligente deben entregarse con muy poca latencia porque el usuario desencadena el proceso, que espera recibir resultados de inmediato. En este escenario, el rendimiento general mejora sustancialmente al configurar el agente de retransmisión y el agente de TFE O ﬄ ine, es decir, antes de la solicitud de los usuarios, y mediante una recuperación eficiente de los 3 correspondientes, se puede acceder al asistente de eventos inteligentes en línea a través de http://www.smarteventassistant.de. Tabla 4: Complejidad de los procesos de filtrado típicos de preservación de la privacidad (PP) frente a no preservación de la privacidad (NPP) en la aplicación realizada. En la versión no preservadora de la privacidad, un agente recupera los perfiles directamente y propaga el resultado a un agente de proveedores.Escenario Push Day Planning Versión NPP PP NPP Tamaño del perfil PP (recuperado/Cantidad total de elementos) Usuario 25/25 25/25 Proveedor 125/10,000 500/10,000 Tiempo transcurrido en el proceso de filtrado (en segundos) Configuración N/A 2.2 N/Ao ﬄ INE Acceso a la base de datos 0.2 0.5 0.4 0.4 Propagación del perfil N/A 0.8 N/A 0.3 Algoritmo de filtrado 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 Propagación de resultados 0.1 1.1 0.1 1.1 Tiempo completo 0.5 4.8 0.7 2.0 Parte del perfil del proveedor: porque el usuario solo está interesado en los elementos,Como las películas, disponibles dentro de un cierto período de tiempo y relacionado con ubicaciones específicas, como proyecciones en los cines en una ciudad específica, la parte relevante del perfil del proveedor suele ser lo suficientemente pequeño como para ser propagada por completo. Debido a que estos parámetros adicionales no se consideran críticos de privacidad (ya que no se basan en el perfil del usuario, sino que constituyen una necesidad de información a corto plazo), la parte relevante del perfil del proveedor puede propagarse como un todo, sin necesidadpara interacciones complejas. Tomados en conjunto, estas mejoras dan como resultado un proceso de filtrado que toma aproximadamente tres veces más que el respectivo proceso de filtrado que no preserva la privacidad, que consideramos una compensación aceptable para el mayor nivel de privacidad. La Tabla 4 muestra los resultados de la evaluación del rendimiento con más detalle. En estos escenarios, se aplica una técnica de filtrado directa basada en el contenido similar a la descrita en la Sección 4.3. Debido a que las técnicas de filtrado equivalentes se han aplicado con éxito en los sistemas de recomendación regulares [9], no hay consecuencias negativas con respecto a la calidad de las recomendaciones.5.2 Enfoques alternativos Como se describe en la Sección 3.2, nuestra solución se basa en la informática confiable. Hay formas más directas de realizar la preservación de la privacidad si, p.Al utilizar una arquitectura centralizada en la que la funcionalidad junto al proveedor de la privacidad se realiza como software confiable basado en la informática confiable. Sin embargo, consideramos que estos enfoques son inadecuados porque son mucho menos genéricos: siempre que alguna parte del software respectivo sea parcheado, actualizado o reemplazado, todo el sistema debe analizarse nuevamente para determinar su confiabilidad, un proceso que es problemáticoen sí mismo debido a su complejidad. En nuestra solución, solo una parte relativamente pequeña del sistema general se basa en la computación confiable. Debido a que las plataformas de agentes se pueden utilizar para una gran variedad de tareas, y debido a que vemos que la computación confiable es el enfoque más prometedor para realizar entornos de agentes seguros y confiables, parece razonable suponer que estos mecanismos respectivos estarán generalmente disponibles en el futuro, independientemente, independientemente, independientemente.de soluciones específicas como la descrita aquí. Conf.en agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 325 6. Conclusión y trabajo adicional Hemos desarrollado un enfoque basado en agentes para los sistemas de recomendación de privacidad. Al utilizar características fundamentales de agentes como la autonomía, la adaptabilidad y la capacidad de comunicarse, extendiendo las capacidades de los gerentes de la plataforma de agentes con respecto al control de la comunicación de agentes, al proporcionar un protocolo de preservación de la privacidad para los procesos de filtrado de información, y utilizando técnicas de filtrado adecuadas para filtrarse.han podido realizar un enfoque que realmente preserva la privacidad en las arquitecturas de filtrado de información de manera multilateral. Como prueba de concepto, hemos utilizado el enfoque dentro de una aplicación que apoya a los usuarios en la planificación de actividades relacionadas con el entretenimiento. Imaginamos varias áreas de trabajo futuro: para lograr la privacidad completa del usuario, el protocolo debe extenderse para mantener las recomendaciones también privadas. En general, los comentarios que hemos obtenido de los usuarios del asistente de eventos inteligentes indica que la mayoría de los usuarios son indiferentes a la privacidad en el contexto de información personal relacionada con el entretenimiento. Por lo tanto, tenemos la intención de utilizar el enfoque para realizar un sistema de recomendación en un dominio más privacesSensible, como la salud o las finanzas, lo que nos permitiría evaluar mejor la aceptación del usuario.7.

        "While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements. 3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity.",

        "The user entity deploys an additional relay entity operating in the same environment.",
        "Through mechanisms provided by this environment, the relay entity is able to control the communication of the TFE, and the provider entity is able to control the communication of both relay entity and the TFE.",
        "Thus, it is possible to ensure that the controlled entities are only able to propagate recommendations, but no other private information.",
        "In the first stage (steps 1.1 to 1.3 of Figure 1), the relay entity establishes control of the TFE, and thus prevents it from propagating user profile information.",
        "User profile data is propagated without participation of the provider entity from the user entity to the TFE via the relay entity.",
        "In the second stage (steps 2.1 to 2.3 of Figure 1), the provider entity establishes control of both relay and TFE, and thus prevents them from propagating provider profile information.",
        "Provider profile data is propagated from the provider entity to the TFE via the relay entity.",
        "In the third stage (steps 3.1 to 3.5 of Figure 1), the TFE returns the recommendations via the relay entity, and the controlled entities are terminated.",

        "The problems of determining acceptable queries on the provider profile and ensuring unlinkability of the recommendations are discussed in the following section.",
        "Our approach requires each entity in the distributed architecture to have the following five main abilities: The ability to perform certain well-defined tasks (such as carrying out a filtering process) with a high degree of autonomy, i.e. largely independent of other entities (e.g. because the respective entity is not able to communicate in an unrestricted manner), the ability to be deployable dynamically in a well-defined environment, the ability to communicate with other entities, the ability to achieve protection against external manipulation attempts, and the ability to control and restrict the communication of other entities.",

        "A cryptographic hash function is used at various points of the protocol, i.e. a function returning a hash value h(x) for given data x that is both preimage-resistant and collision-resistant1 .",
        "We denote a set of hash values for a data set X = {x1, .., xn} as H(X) = {h(x1), .., h(xn)}, whereas h(X) denotes a single hash value of a data set. 4.1 Controller Module As noted above, the ability to control the communication of agents is generally not a feature of existing MAS architectures2 but at the same time a central requirement of our approach for privacy-preserving Information Filtering.",
        "The required functionality cannot be realized based on regular agent services or components, because an agent on a platform is usually not allowed to interfere with the actions of other agents in any way.",
        "Therefore, we add additional infrastructure providing the required functionality to the MAS architecture itself, resulting in an agent environment with extended functionality and responsibilities.",
        "Controlling the communication capabilities of an agent is realized by restricting via rules, in a manner similar to a firewall, but with the consent of the respective agent, its incoming and outgoing communication to specific platforms or agents on external platforms as well as other possible communication channels, such as the file system.",
        "Consent is required because otherwise the overall security would be compromised, as attackers could arbitrarily block various communication channels.",
        "Our approach does not require controlling the communication between agents on the same platform, and therefore this aspect is not addressed.",
        "Consequently, all rules addressing communication capabilities have to be enforced across entire platforms, because otherwise a controlled agent could just use a non-controlled agent 1 In the implementation, we have used the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the symmetric encryption scheme and SHA-1 as the cryptographic hash function. 2 A recent survey on agent environments [24] concludes that aspects related to agent environments are often neglected, and does not indicate any existing work in this particular area. on the same platform as a relay for communicating with agents residing on external platforms.",
        "Various agent services provide functionality for adding and revoking control of platforms, including functionality required in complex scenarios where controlled agents in turn control further platforms.",
        "The implementation of the actual control mechanism depends on the actual MAS architecture.",
        "In our implementation, we have utilized methods provided via the Java Security Manager as part of the Java security model.",
        "Thus, the supervisor agent is enabled to define custom security policies, thereby granting or denying other agents access to resources required for communication with other agents as well as communication in general, such as files or sockets for TCP/IP-based communication. 4.2 Recommender Module The Recommender Module is mainly responsible for carrying out information filtering processes, according to the protocol described in Table 1.",
        "The participating entities are realized as agents, and the interactions as agent services.",
        "We assume that mechanisms for secure agent communication are available within the respective MAS architecture.",
        "Two issues have to be addressed in this module: The relevant parts of the provider profile have to be retrieved without compromising the users privacy, and the recommendations have to be propagated in a privacy-preserving way.",
        "Our solution is based on a threat model in which no main abstract entity may safely assume any other abstract entity to act in an honest manner: Each entity has to assume that other entities may attempt to obtain private information, either while following the specified protocol or even by deviating from the protocol.",
        "According to [15], we classify the former case as honest-but-curious behavior (as an example, the TFE may propagate recommendations as specified, but may additionally attempt to propagate private information), and the latter case as malicious behavior (as an example, the filter may attempt to propagate private information instead of the recommendations). 4.2.1 Retrieving the Provider Profile As outlined above, the relay agent relays data between the TFE agent and the provider agent.",
        "These agents are not allowed to communicate directly, because the TFE agent cannot be assumed to act in an honest manner.",
        "Unlike the user profile, which is usually rather small, the provider profile is often too voluminous to be propagated as a whole efficiently.",
        "A typical example is a user profile containing ratings of about 100 movies, while the provider profile contains some 10,000 movies.",
        "Retrieving only the relevant part of the provider profile, however, is problematic because it has to be done without leaking sensitive information about the user profile.",
        "Therefore, the relay agent has to analyze all queries on the provider profile, and reject potentially critical queries, such as queries containing a set of user profile items.",
        "Because the propagation of single unlinkable user profile items is assumed to be uncritical, we extend the information filtering protocol as follows: The relevant parts of the provider profile are retrieved based on single anonymous interactions between the relay and the provider.",

        "Obviously, unlinkability is only achieved if multiple instances of the protocol are executed simultaneously between the provider and different users.",

        "To prevent the uncontrolled relay agents from propagating provider profile data, the respective data is encrypted and the key is provided only after control has been established.",
        "Therefore, the second phase of the protocol described in Table 1 is replaced as described in Table 2.",
        "Additionally, the relay agent may allow other interactions as long as no user profile items are used within the queries.",
        "In this case, the relay agent has to ensure that the provider does not obtain any information exceeding the information deducible via the recommendations themselves.",
        "The clusterbased filtering technique described in Section 4.3 is an example for a filtering technique operating in this manner. 4.2.2 Recommendation Propagation The propagation of the recommendations is even more problematic mainly because more participants are involved: Recommendations have to be propagated from the TFE agent via the relay and provider agent to the user agent.",
        "No participant should be able to alter the recommendations or use them for the propagation of private information.",

        "Thus, the relay is able to verify the recommendations before they are propagated further.",
        "The relay, however, may suspect the data propagated as the encrypted hash to contain private information instead of the actual hash value.",

        "Additionally, the encryption scheme must not be commutative for similar reasons.",

        "The interactions of Step 3.5 to Step 3.8 ensure, via the same mechanisms used in Step 3.1 to 3.4, that the provider is able to analyze the recommendations before the user obtains them, but at the same time prevent the provider from altering the recommendations.",

        "Upon completion of the protocol, both user and provider have obtained a set of recommendations.",
        "If the user wants these recommendations to be unlinkable to himself, the user agent has to carry out the entire protocol anonymously.",
        "Again, the most straightforward way to achieve this is to use additional relay agents deployed via the user agent which are used once for a single information filtering process. 4.3 Exemplary Filtering Techniques The filtering technique applied by the TFE agent cannot be chosen freely: All collaboration-based approaches, such as collaborative filtering techniques based on the profiles of a set of users, are not applicable because the provider profile does not contain user profile data (unless this data has been collected externally).",
        "Instead, these approaches are realized via the Matchmaker Module, which is outside the scope of this paper.",
        "Learning-based approaches are not applicable because the TFE agent cannot propagate any acquired data to the filter, which effectively means that the filter is incapable of learning.",
        "Filtering techniques that are actually applicable are feature-based approaches, such as content-based filtering (in which profile items are compared via their attributes) and knowledge-based filtering (in which domain-specific knowledge is applied in order to match user and provider profile items).",
        "An overview of different classes and hybrid combinations of filtering techniques is given in [5].",
        "We have implemented two generic content-based filtering approaches that are applicable within our approach: A direct content-based filtering technique based on the class of item-based top-N recommendation algorithms [9] is used in cases where the user profile contains items that are also contained in the provider profile.",
        "In a preprocessing stage, i.e. prior to the actual information filtering processes, a model is generated containing the k most similar items for each provider profile item.",
        "While computationally rather complex, this approach is feasible because it has to be done only once, and it is carried out in a privacy-preserving way via interactions between the provider agent and a TFE agent.",
        "The resulting model is stored by the provider agent and can be seen as an additional part of the provider profile.",
        "In the actual information filtering process, the k most similar items are retrieved for each single user profile item via queries on the model (as described in Section 4.2.1, this is possible in a privacy-preserving way via anonymous communication).",
        "Recommendations are generated by selecting the n most frequent items from the result sets that are not already contained within the user profile.",
        "As an alternative approach applicable when the user profile contains information in addition to provider profile items, we provide a cluster-based approach in which provider profile items are clustered in a preprocessing stage via an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach.",
        "Each cluster is represented by a centroid item, and the cluster elements are either sub-clusters or, on the lowest level, the items themselves.",
        "In the information filtering stage, the relevant items are retrieved by descending through the cluster hierarchy in the following manner: The cluster items of the highest level are retrieved independent of the user profile.",
        "By comparing these items with the user profile data, the most relevant sub-clusters are determined and retrieved in a subsequent iteration.",
        "This process is repeated until the lowest level is reached, which contains the items themselves as recommendations.",
        "Throughout the process, user profile items are never propagated to the provider as such.",
        "The information deducible about the user profile does not exceed the information deducible via the recommendations themselves (because essentially only a chain of cluster centroids leading to the recommendations is retrieved), and therefore it is not regarded as privacy-critical. 4.4 Implementation We have implemented the approach for privacy-preserving IF based on JIAC IV [12], a FIPA-compliant MAS architecture.",

        "Because these additional parameters are not seen as privacy-critical (as they are not based on the user profile, but rather constitute a short-term information need), the relevant part of the provider profile may be propagated as a whole, with no need for complex interactions.",

        "In these scenarios, a direct content-based filtering technique similar to the one described in Section 4.3 is applied.",

                "In contrast to Information Retrieval (IR) systems, where relevant information is extracted based on search queries, IF architectures generate personalized information based on user profiles containing, for each given user, personal data, preferences, and rated items.",

                "According to surveys indicating major privacy concerns of users in the context of Recommender Systems and e-commerce in general [23], users can be expected to be less reluctant to provide personal information if they trust the system to be privacy-preserving with regard to personal data.",

                "These approaches ultimately assume that the provider actually intends to protect the privacy of the user data, and offer support for this task, but they are not intended to prevent the provider from acting in a malicious manner.",

                "Whereas in some applications the provider and filter entities explicitly trust each other, because they are deployed by the same party, our solution is applicable more generically because it does not require any trust between the main abstract entities.",
                "In this paper, we focus on aspects related to the information filtering process itself, and omit all aspects related to information collection and processing, i.e. the stages in which profiles are generated and maintained, mainly because these stages are less critical with regard to privacy, as they involve fewer different entities. 3.1 Requirements Our solution aims at meeting the following requirements with regard to privacy: • User Privacy: No linkable information about user profiles should be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party, including other user entities.",
                "Single user profile items, however, may be acquired permanently if they are unlinkable, i.e. if they cannot be attributed to a specific user or linked to other user profile items.",
                "Temporary acquisition of private information is permitted as well.",
                "Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.",
                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",
                "Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted.",
                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",
                "Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information. • Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party.",
                "General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique.",
                "In addition, general requirements regarding the quality of the recommendations as well as security aspects, performance and broadness of the resulting system have to be addressed as well.",
                "While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements. 3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity.",
                "The filter entity provides the recommendations, and subsequently deletes all private information, thus fulfilling the requirement regarding permanent acquisition of private information. 320 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The entities whose private information is propagated have to be certain that the respective information is actually acquired temporarily only.",
                "Trust in this regard may be established in two main ways: • Trusted Software: The respective entity itself is trusted to remove the respective information as specified. • Trusted Environment: The respective entity operates in an environment that is trusted to control the communication and life cycle of the entity to an extent that the removal of the respective information may be achieved regardless of the attempted actions of the entity itself.",
                "Additionally, the environment itself is trusted not to act in a malicious manner (e.g. it is trusted not to acquire and propagate the respective information itself).",
                "In both cases, trust may be established in various ways.",
                "Reputation-based mechanisms, additional trusted third parties certifying entities or environments, or trusted computing mechanisms may be used.",
                "Our approach is based on a trusted environment realized via trusted computing mechanisms, because we see this solution as the most generic and realistic approach.",
                "This decision is discussed briefly in Section 5.",
                "We are now able to specify the abstract information filtering protocol as shown in Figure 1: The filter entity deploys a Temporary Filter Entity (TFE) operating in a trusted environment.",

                "Through mechanisms provided by this environment, the relay entity is able to control the communication of the TFE, and the provider entity is able to control the communication of both relay entity and the TFE.",
                "Thus, it is possible to ensure that the controlled entities are only able to propagate recommendations, but no other private information.",
                "In the first stage (steps 1.1 to 1.3 of Figure 1), the relay entity establishes control of the TFE, and thus prevents it from propagating user profile information.",
                "User profile data is propagated without participation of the provider entity from the user entity to the TFE via the relay entity.",
                "In the second stage (steps 2.1 to 2.3 of Figure 1), the provider entity establishes control of both relay and TFE, and thus prevents them from propagating provider profile information.",
                "Provider profile data is propagated from the provider entity to the TFE via the relay entity.",
                "In the third stage (steps 3.1 to 3.5 of Figure 1), the TFE returns the recommendations via the relay entity, and the controlled entities are terminated.",
                "Taken together, these steps ensure that all private information is acquired temporarily only by the other main entities.",
                "The problems of determining acceptable queries on the provider profile and ensuring unlinkability of the recommendations are discussed in the following section.",
                "Our approach requires each entity in the distributed architecture to have the following five main abilities: The ability to perform certain well-defined tasks (such as carrying out a filtering process) with a high degree of autonomy, i.e. largely independent of other entities (e.g. because the respective entity is not able to communicate in an unrestricted manner), the ability to be deployable dynamically in a well-defined environment, the ability to communicate with other entities, the ability to achieve protection against external manipulation attempts, and the ability to control and restrict the communication of other entities.",

                "MAS architectures are an ideal solution for realizing a distributed system characterized by these features, because they provide agents constituting entities that are actually characterized by autonomy, mobility and the ability to communicate [26], as well as agent platforms as environments providing means to realize the security of agents.",
                "In this context, the issue of malicious hosts, i.e. hosts attacking agents, has to be addressed explicitly.",

                "The entities introduced above are mapped directly to agents, and the trusted environment in which they exist is realized in the form of agent platforms.",
                "In addition to the MAS architecture itself, which is assumed as given, our solution consists of the following five main modules: • The Controller Module described in Section 4.1 provides functionality for controlling the communication capabilities of agents. • The Transparent Persistence Module facilitates the use of different data storage mechanisms, and provides a uniform interface for accessing persistent information, which may be utilized for monitoring critical interactions involving potentially private information e.g. as part of queries.",

                "A cryptographic hash function is used at various points of the protocol, i.e. a function returning a hash value h(x) for given data x that is both preimage-resistant and collision-resistant1 .",
                "We denote a set of hash values for a data set X = {x1, .., xn} as H(X) = {h(x1), .., h(xn)}, whereas h(X) denotes a single hash value of a data set. 4.1 Controller Module As noted above, the ability to control the communication of agents is generally not a feature of existing MAS architectures2 but at the same time a central requirement of our approach for privacy-preserving Information Filtering.",
                "The required functionality cannot be realized based on regular agent services or components, because an agent on a platform is usually not allowed to interfere with the actions of other agents in any way.",
                "Therefore, we add additional infrastructure providing the required functionality to the MAS architecture itself, resulting in an agent environment with extended functionality and responsibilities.",
                "Controlling the communication capabilities of an agent is realized by restricting via rules, in a manner similar to a firewall, but with the consent of the respective agent, its incoming and outgoing communication to specific platforms or agents on external platforms as well as other possible communication channels, such as the file system.",
                "Consent is required because otherwise the overall security would be compromised, as attackers could arbitrarily block various communication channels.",
                "Our approach does not require controlling the communication between agents on the same platform, and therefore this aspect is not addressed.",
                "Consequently, all rules addressing communication capabilities have to be enforced across entire platforms, because otherwise a controlled agent could just use a non-controlled agent 1 In the implementation, we have used the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the symmetric encryption scheme and SHA-1 as the cryptographic hash function. 2 A recent survey on agent environments [24] concludes that aspects related to agent environments are often neglected, and does not indicate any existing work in this particular area. on the same platform as a relay for communicating with agents residing on external platforms.",

                "The implementation of the actual control mechanism depends on the actual MAS architecture.",
                "In our implementation, we have utilized methods provided via the Java Security Manager as part of the Java security model.",
                "Thus, the supervisor agent is enabled to define custom security policies, thereby granting or denying other agents access to resources required for communication with other agents as well as communication in general, such as files or sockets for TCP/IP-based communication. 4.2 Recommender Module The Recommender Module is mainly responsible for carrying out information filtering processes, according to the protocol described in Table 1.",
                "The participating entities are realized as agents, and the interactions as agent services.",
                "We assume that mechanisms for secure agent communication are available within the respective MAS architecture.",
                "Two issues have to be addressed in this module: The relevant parts of the provider profile have to be retrieved without compromising the users privacy, and the recommendations have to be propagated in a privacy-preserving way.",
                "Our solution is based on a threat model in which no main abstract entity may safely assume any other abstract entity to act in an honest manner: Each entity has to assume that other entities may attempt to obtain private information, either while following the specified protocol or even by deviating from the protocol.",
                "According to [15], we classify the former case as honest-but-curious behavior (as an example, the TFE may propagate recommendations as specified, but may additionally attempt to propagate private information), and the latter case as malicious behavior (as an example, the filter may attempt to propagate private information instead of the recommendations). 4.2.1 Retrieving the Provider Profile As outlined above, the relay agent relays data between the TFE agent and the provider agent.",
                "These agents are not allowed to communicate directly, because the TFE agent cannot be assumed to act in an honest manner.",
                "Unlike the user profile, which is usually rather small, the provider profile is often too voluminous to be propagated as a whole efficiently.",
                "A typical example is a user profile containing ratings of about 100 movies, while the provider profile contains some 10,000 movies.",
                "Retrieving only the relevant part of the provider profile, however, is problematic because it has to be done without leaking sensitive information about the user profile.",
                "Therefore, the relay agent has to analyze all queries on the provider profile, and reject potentially critical queries, such as queries containing a set of user profile items.",

                "While computationally rather complex, this approach is feasible because it has to be done only once, and it is carried out in a privacy-preserving way via interactions between the provider agent and a TFE agent.",
                "The resulting model is stored by the provider agent and can be seen as an additional part of the provider profile.",

                "Recommendations are generated by selecting the n most frequent items from the result sets that are not already contained within the user profile.",
                "As an alternative approach applicable when the user profile contains information in addition to provider profile items, we provide a cluster-based approach in which provider profile items are clustered in a preprocessing stage via an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach.",

                "Whereas in some applications the provider and filter entities explicitly trust each other, because they are deployed by the same party, our solution is applicable more generically because it does not require any trust between the main abstract entities.",
                "In this paper, we focus on aspects related to the information filtering process itself, and omit all aspects related to information collection and processing, i.e. the stages in which profiles are generated and maintained, mainly because these stages are less critical with regard to privacy, as they involve fewer different entities. 3.1 Requirements Our solution aims at meeting the following requirements with regard to privacy: • User Privacy: No linkable information about user profiles should be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party, including other user entities.",
                "Single user profile items, however, may be acquired permanently if they are unlinkable, i.e. if they cannot be attributed to a specific user or linked to other user profile items.",
                "Temporary acquisition of private information is permitted as well.",
                "Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.",
                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",
                "Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted.",
                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",
                "Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information. • Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party.",
                "General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique.",
                "In addition, general requirements regarding the quality of the recommendations as well as security aspects, performance and broadness of the resulting system have to be addressed as well.",
                "While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements. 3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity.",
                "The filter entity provides the recommendations, and subsequently deletes all private information, thus fulfilling the requirement regarding permanent acquisition of private information. 320 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The entities whose private information is propagated have to be certain that the respective information is actually acquired temporarily only.",
                "Trust in this regard may be established in two main ways: • Trusted Software: The respective entity itself is trusted to remove the respective information as specified. • Trusted Environment: The respective entity operates in an environment that is trusted to control the communication and life cycle of the entity to an extent that the removal of the respective information may be achieved regardless of the attempted actions of the entity itself.",
                "Additionally, the environment itself is trusted not to act in a malicious manner (e.g. it is trusted not to acquire and propagate the respective information itself).",

                "Reputation-based mechanisms, additional trusted third parties certifying entities or environments, or trusted computing mechanisms may be used.",
                "Our approach is based on a trusted environment realized via trusted computing mechanisms, because we see this solution as the most generic and realistic approach.",
                "This decision is discussed briefly in Section 5.",

                "Through mechanisms provided by this environment, the relay entity is able to control the communication of the TFE, and the provider entity is able to control the communication of both relay entity and the TFE.",
                "Thus, it is possible to ensure that the controlled entities are only able to propagate recommendations, but no other private information.",
                "In the first stage (steps 1.1 to 1.3 of Figure 1), the relay entity establishes control of the TFE, and thus prevents it from propagating user profile information.",

                "In the third stage (steps 3.1 to 3.5 of Figure 1), the TFE returns the recommendations via the relay entity, and the controlled entities are terminated.",
                "Taken together, these steps ensure that all private information is acquired temporarily only by the other main entities.",
                "The problems of determining acceptable queries on the provider profile and ensuring unlinkability of the recommendations are discussed in the following section.",
                "Our approach requires each entity in the distributed architecture to have the following five main abilities: The ability to perform certain well-defined tasks (such as carrying out a filtering process) with a high degree of autonomy, i.e. largely independent of other entities (e.g. because the respective entity is not able to communicate in an unrestricted manner), the ability to be deployable dynamically in a well-defined environment, the ability to communicate with other entities, the ability to achieve protection against external manipulation attempts, and the ability to control and restrict the communication of other entities.",

                "MAS architectures are an ideal solution for realizing a distributed system characterized by these features, because they provide agents constituting entities that are actually characterized by autonomy, mobility and the ability to communicate [26], as well as agent platforms as environments providing means to realize the security of agents.",
                "In this context, the issue of malicious hosts, i.e. hosts attacking agents, has to be addressed explicitly.",

                "In addition to the MAS architecture itself, which is assumed as given, our solution consists of the following five main modules: • The Controller Module described in Section 4.1 provides functionality for controlling the communication capabilities of agents. • The Transparent Persistence Module facilitates the use of different data storage mechanisms, and provides a uniform interface for accessing persistent information, which may be utilized for monitoring critical interactions involving potentially private information e.g. as part of queries.",

                "We denote a set of hash values for a data set X = {x1, .., xn} as H(X) = {h(x1), .., h(xn)}, whereas h(X) denotes a single hash value of a data set. 4.1 Controller Module As noted above, the ability to control the communication of agents is generally not a feature of existing MAS architectures2 but at the same time a central requirement of our approach for privacy-preserving Information Filtering.",
                "The required functionality cannot be realized based on regular agent services or components, because an agent on a platform is usually not allowed to interfere with the actions of other agents in any way.",
                "Therefore, we add additional infrastructure providing the required functionality to the MAS architecture itself, resulting in an agent environment with extended functionality and responsibilities.",
                "Controlling the communication capabilities of an agent is realized by restricting via rules, in a manner similar to a firewall, but with the consent of the respective agent, its incoming and outgoing communication to specific platforms or agents on external platforms as well as other possible communication channels, such as the file system.",
                "Consent is required because otherwise the overall security would be compromised, as attackers could arbitrarily block various communication channels.",
                "Our approach does not require controlling the communication between agents on the same platform, and therefore this aspect is not addressed.",
                "Consequently, all rules addressing communication capabilities have to be enforced across entire platforms, because otherwise a controlled agent could just use a non-controlled agent 1 In the implementation, we have used the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the symmetric encryption scheme and SHA-1 as the cryptographic hash function. 2 A recent survey on agent environments [24] concludes that aspects related to agent environments are often neglected, and does not indicate any existing work in this particular area. on the same platform as a relay for communicating with agents residing on external platforms.",

                "In our implementation, we have utilized methods provided via the Java Security Manager as part of the Java security model.",
                "Thus, the supervisor agent is enabled to define custom security policies, thereby granting or denying other agents access to resources required for communication with other agents as well as communication in general, such as files or sockets for TCP/IP-based communication. 4.2 Recommender Module The Recommender Module is mainly responsible for carrying out information filtering processes, according to the protocol described in Table 1.",
                "The participating entities are realized as agents, and the interactions as agent services.",
                "We assume that mechanisms for secure agent communication are available within the respective MAS architecture.",
                "Two issues have to be addressed in this module: The relevant parts of the provider profile have to be retrieved without compromising the users privacy, and the recommendations have to be propagated in a privacy-preserving way.",
                "Our solution is based on a threat model in which no main abstract entity may safely assume any other abstract entity to act in an honest manner: Each entity has to assume that other entities may attempt to obtain private information, either while following the specified protocol or even by deviating from the protocol.",
                "According to [15], we classify the former case as honest-but-curious behavior (as an example, the TFE may propagate recommendations as specified, but may additionally attempt to propagate private information), and the latter case as malicious behavior (as an example, the filter may attempt to propagate private information instead of the recommendations). 4.2.1 Retrieving the Provider Profile As outlined above, the relay agent relays data between the TFE agent and the provider agent.",
                "These agents are not allowed to communicate directly, because the TFE agent cannot be assumed to act in an honest manner.",
                "Unlike the user profile, which is usually rather small, the provider profile is often too voluminous to be propagated as a whole efficiently.",
                "A typical example is a user profile containing ratings of about 100 movies, while the provider profile contains some 10,000 movies.",
                "Retrieving only the relevant part of the provider profile, however, is problematic because it has to be done without leaking sensitive information about the user profile.",
                "Therefore, the relay agent has to analyze all queries on the provider profile, and reject potentially critical queries, such as queries containing a set of user profile items.",
                "Because the propagation of single unlinkable user profile items is assumed to be uncritical, we extend the information filtering protocol as follows: The relevant parts of the provider profile are retrieved based on single anonymous interactions between the relay and the provider.",
                "If the MAS architecture used for the implementation does not provide an infrastructure for anonymous agent communication, this feature has to be provided explicitly: The most straightforward way is to use additional relay agents deployed via 322 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Obviously, unlinkability is only achieved if multiple instances of the protocol are executed simultaneously between the provider and different users.",
                "Because agents on controlled platforms are unable to communicate anonymously with the respective controlling agent, control has to be established after the anonymous interactions have been completed.",

                "The clusterbased filtering technique described in Section 4.3 is an example for a filtering technique operating in this manner. 4.2.2 Recommendation Propagation The propagation of the recommendations is even more problematic mainly because more participants are involved: Recommendations have to be propagated from the TFE agent via the relay and provider agent to the user agent.",
                "No participant should be able to alter the recommendations or use them for the propagation of private information.",

                "We have implemented two generic content-based filtering approaches that are applicable within our approach: A direct content-based filtering technique based on the class of item-based top-N recommendation algorithms [9] is used in cases where the user profile contains items that are also contained in the provider profile.",
                "In a preprocessing stage, i.e. prior to the actual information filtering processes, a model is generated containing the k most similar items for each provider profile item.",
                "While computationally rather complex, this approach is feasible because it has to be done only once, and it is carried out in a privacy-preserving way via interactions between the provider agent and a TFE agent.",
                "The resulting model is stored by the provider agent and can be seen as an additional part of the provider profile.",
                "In the actual information filtering process, the k most similar items are retrieved for each single user profile item via queries on the model (as described in Section 4.2.1, this is possible in a privacy-preserving way via anonymous communication).",
                "Recommendations are generated by selecting the n most frequent items from the result sets that are not already contained within the user profile.",
                "As an alternative approach applicable when the user profile contains information in addition to provider profile items, we provide a cluster-based approach in which provider profile items are clustered in a preprocessing stage via an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach.",

                "In the information filtering stage, the relevant items are retrieved by descending through the cluster hierarchy in the following manner: The cluster items of the highest level are retrieved independent of the user profile.",

                "The provided body of information is usually structured and collected in provider profiles.",
                "Filtering techniques operate on these profiles in order to generate recommendations of items that are probably relevant for a given user, or in order to determine users with similar interests, or both.",
                "Depending on the respective goal, the resulting systems constitute Recommender Systems [5], Matchmaker Systems [10], or a combination thereof.",
                "The aspect of privacy is an essential issue in all IF systems: Generating personalized information obviously requires the use of personal data.",
                "According to surveys indicating major privacy concerns of users in the context of Recommender Systems and e-commerce in general [23], users can be expected to be less reluctant to provide personal information if they trust the system to be privacy-preserving with regard to personal data.",
                "Similar considerations also apply to the information provider, who may want to control the dissemination of the provided information, and to the provider of the filtering techniques, who may not want the details of the utilized filtering algorithms to become common knowledge.",
                "A privacy-preserving IF system should therefore balance these requirements and protect the privacy of all parties involved in a multilateral way, while addressing general requirements regarding performance, security and quality of the recommendations as well.",
                "As described in the following section, there are several approaches with similar goals, but none of these provide a generic approach in which the privacy of all parties is preserved.",
                "We have developed an agent-based approach for privacypreserving IF which has been utilized for realizing a combined Recommender/Matchmaker System as part of an application supporting users in planning entertainment-related activities.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the Recommender System functionality.",
                "Our approach is based on Multi-Agent System (MAS) technology because fundamental features of agents such as autonomy, adaptability and the ability to communicate are essential requirements of our approach.",
                "In other words, the realized approach does not merely constitute a solution for privacy-preserving IF within a MAS context, but rather utilizes a MAS architecture in order to realize a solution for privacy-preserving IF, which could not be realized easily otherwise.",

                "Section 6 concludes the paper with an outlook and outlines further work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK There is a large amount of work in related areas, such as Private Information Retrieval [7], Privacy-Preserving Data Mining [2], and other privacy-preserving protocols [4, 16], most of which is based on Secure Multi-Party Computation [27].",
                "We have ruled out Secure Multi-Party Computation approaches mainly because of their complexity, and because the algorithm that is computed securely is not considered to be private in these approaches.",
                "Various enforcement mechanisms have been suggested that are applicable in the context of privacy-preserving Information Filtering, such as enterprise privacy policies [17] or hippocratic databases [1], both of which annotate user data with additional meta-information specifying how the data is to be handled on the provider side.",
                "These approaches ultimately assume that the provider actually intends to protect the privacy of the user data, and offer support for this task, but they are not intended to prevent the provider from acting in a malicious manner.",

                "Whereas in some applications the provider and filter entities explicitly trust each other, because they are deployed by the same party, our solution is applicable more generically because it does not require any trust between the main abstract entities.",
                "In this paper, we focus on aspects related to the information filtering process itself, and omit all aspects related to information collection and processing, i.e. the stages in which profiles are generated and maintained, mainly because these stages are less critical with regard to privacy, as they involve fewer different entities. 3.1 Requirements Our solution aims at meeting the following requirements with regard to privacy: • User Privacy: No linkable information about user profiles should be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party, including other user entities.",
                "Single user profile items, however, may be acquired permanently if they are unlinkable, i.e. if they cannot be attributed to a specific user or linked to other user profile items.",

                "Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.",
                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",
                "Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted.",
                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",
                "Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information. • Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party.",
                "General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique.",
                "In addition, general requirements regarding the quality of the recommendations as well as security aspects, performance and broadness of the resulting system have to be addressed as well.",
                "While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements. 3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity.",
                "The filter entity provides the recommendations, and subsequently deletes all private information, thus fulfilling the requirement regarding permanent acquisition of private information. 320 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Controlling the communication capabilities of an agent is realized by restricting via rules, in a manner similar to a firewall, but with the consent of the respective agent, its incoming and outgoing communication to specific platforms or agents on external platforms as well as other possible communication channels, such as the file system.",

                "Again, the most straightforward way to achieve this is to use additional relay agents deployed via the user agent which are used once for a single information filtering process. 4.3 Exemplary Filtering Techniques The filtering technique applied by the TFE agent cannot be chosen freely: All collaboration-based approaches, such as collaborative filtering techniques based on the profiles of a set of users, are not applicable because the provider profile does not contain user profile data (unless this data has been collected externally).",
                "Instead, these approaches are realized via the Matchmaker Module, which is outside the scope of this paper.",
                "Learning-based approaches are not applicable because the TFE agent cannot propagate any acquired data to the filter, which effectively means that the filter is incapable of learning.",
                "Filtering techniques that are actually applicable are feature-based approaches, such as content-based filtering (in which profile items are compared via their attributes) and knowledge-based filtering (in which domain-specific knowledge is applied in order to match user and provider profile items).",
                "An overview of different classes and hybrid combinations of filtering techniques is given in [5].",
                "We have implemented two generic content-based filtering approaches that are applicable within our approach: A direct content-based filtering technique based on the class of item-based top-N recommendation algorithms [9] is used in cases where the user profile contains items that are also contained in the provider profile.",
                "In a preprocessing stage, i.e. prior to the actual information filtering processes, a model is generated containing the k most similar items for each provider profile item.",
                "While computationally rather complex, this approach is feasible because it has to be done only once, and it is carried out in a privacy-preserving way via interactions between the provider agent and a TFE agent.",
                "The resulting model is stored by the provider agent and can be seen as an additional part of the provider profile.",
                "In the actual information filtering process, the k most similar items are retrieved for each single user profile item via queries on the model (as described in Section 4.2.1, this is possible in a privacy-preserving way via anonymous communication).",
                "Recommendations are generated by selecting the n most frequent items from the result sets that are not already contained within the user profile.",
                "As an alternative approach applicable when the user profile contains information in addition to provider profile items, we provide a cluster-based approach in which provider profile items are clustered in a preprocessing stage via an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach.",
                "Each cluster is represented by a centroid item, and the cluster elements are either sub-clusters or, on the lowest level, the items themselves.",
                "In the information filtering stage, the relevant items are retrieved by descending through the cluster hierarchy in the following manner: The cluster items of the highest level are retrieved independent of the user profile.",
                "By comparing these items with the user profile data, the most relevant sub-clusters are determined and retrieved in a subsequent iteration.",
                "This process is repeated until the lowest level is reached, which contains the items themselves as recommendations.",
                "Throughout the process, user profile items are never propagated to the provider as such.",
                "The information deducible about the user profile does not exceed the information deducible via the recommendations themselves (because essentially only a chain of cluster centroids leading to the recommendations is retrieved), and therefore it is not regarded as privacy-critical. 4.4 Implementation We have implemented the approach for privacy-preserving IF based on JIAC IV [12], a FIPA-compliant MAS architecture.",
                "JIAC IV integrates fundamental aspects of autonomous agents regarding pro-activeness, intelligence, communication capabilities and mobility by providing a scalable component-based architecture.",
                "Additionally, JIAC IV offers components realizing management and security functionality, and provides a methodology for Agent-Oriented Software Engineering.",
                "JIAC IV stands out among MAS architectures as the only security-certified architecture, since it has been certified by the German Federal Office for Information Security according to the EAL3 of the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security standard [14].",
                "JIAC IV offers several security features in the areas of access control for agent services, secure communication between agents, and low-level security based on Java security policies [21], and thus provides all security-related functionality required for our approach.",
                "We have extended the JIAC IV architecture by adding the mechanisms for communication control described in Section 4.1.",
                "Regarding the issue of malicious hosts, we currently assume all providers of agent platforms to be trusted.",

                "Performance is a critical issue, mainly because of the overhead caused by creating additional agents and agent platforms for controlling communication, and by the additional interactions within the Recommender Module.",
                "Overall, a single information filtering process takes about ten times longer than a non-privacy-preserving information filtering process leading to the same results, which is a considerable overhead but still acceptable under certain conditions, as described in the following section. 5.1 The Smart Event Assistant As a proof of concept, and in order to evaluate performance and quality under real-life conditions, we have ap324 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Because these additional parameters are not seen as privacy-critical (as they are not based on the user profile, but rather constitute a short-term information need), the relevant part of the provider profile may be propagated as a whole, with no need for complex interactions.",
                "Taken together, these improvements result in a filtering process that takes about three times as long as the respective nonprivacy-preserving filtering process, which we regard as an acceptable trade-off for the increased level of privacy.",

                "In our solution, only a comparatively small part of the overall system is based on trusted computing.",
                "Because agent platforms can be utilized for a large variety of tasks, and because we see trusted computing as the most promising approach to realize secure and trusted agent environments, it seems reasonable to assume that these respective mechanisms will be generally available in the future, independent of specific solutions such as the one described here.",

                "Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.",
                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",
                "Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted.",
                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",

                "Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.",
                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",
                "Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted.",
                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",
                "Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information. • Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party.",
                "General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique.",
                "In addition, general requirements regarding the quality of the recommendations as well as security aspects, performance and broadness of the resulting system have to be addressed as well.",
                "While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements. 3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity.",
                "The filter entity provides the recommendations, and subsequently deletes all private information, thus fulfilling the requirement regarding permanent acquisition of private information. 320 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Whereas in some applications the provider and filter entities explicitly trust each other, because they are deployed by the same party, our solution is applicable more generically because it does not require any trust between the main abstract entities.",
                "In this paper, we focus on aspects related to the information filtering process itself, and omit all aspects related to information collection and processing, i.e. the stages in which profiles are generated and maintained, mainly because these stages are less critical with regard to privacy, as they involve fewer different entities. 3.1 Requirements Our solution aims at meeting the following requirements with regard to privacy: • User Privacy: No linkable information about user profiles should be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party, including other user entities.",
                "Single user profile items, however, may be acquired permanently if they are unlinkable, i.e. if they cannot be attributed to a specific user or linked to other user profile items.",
                "Temporary acquisition of private information is permitted as well.",
                "Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.",
                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",
                "Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted.",
                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",
                "Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information. • Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party.",
                "General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique.",
                "In addition, general requirements regarding the quality of the recommendations as well as security aspects, performance and broadness of the resulting system have to be addressed as well.",
                "While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements. 3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity.",
                "The filter entity provides the recommendations, and subsequently deletes all private information, thus fulfilling the requirement regarding permanent acquisition of private information. 320 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The entities whose private information is propagated have to be certain that the respective information is actually acquired temporarily only.",
                "Trust in this regard may be established in two main ways: • <br>trusted software</br>: The respective entity itself is trusted to remove the respective information as specified. • Trusted Environment: The respective entity operates in an environment that is trusted to control the communication and life cycle of the entity to an extent that the removal of the respective information may be achieved regardless of the attempted actions of the entity itself.",
                "Additionally, the environment itself is trusted not to act in a malicious manner (e.g. it is trusted not to acquire and propagate the respective information itself).",

                "Reputation-based mechanisms, additional trusted third parties certifying entities or environments, or trusted computing mechanisms may be used.",
                "Our approach is based on a trusted environment realized via trusted computing mechanisms, because we see this solution as the most generic and realistic approach.",

                "Through mechanisms provided by this environment, the relay entity is able to control the communication of the TFE, and the provider entity is able to control the communication of both relay entity and the TFE.",
                "Thus, it is possible to ensure that the controlled entities are only able to propagate recommendations, but no other private information.",
                "In the first stage (steps 1.1 to 1.3 of Figure 1), the relay entity establishes control of the TFE, and thus prevents it from propagating user profile information.",

                "In the third stage (steps 3.1 to 3.5 of Figure 1), the TFE returns the recommendations via the relay entity, and the controlled entities are terminated.",
                "Taken together, these steps ensure that all private information is acquired temporarily only by the other main entities.",
                "The problems of determining acceptable queries on the provider profile and ensuring unlinkability of the recommendations are discussed in the following section.",
                "Our approach requires each entity in the distributed architecture to have the following five main abilities: The ability to perform certain well-defined tasks (such as carrying out a filtering process) with a high degree of autonomy, i.e. largely independent of other entities (e.g. because the respective entity is not able to communicate in an unrestricted manner), the ability to be deployable dynamically in a well-defined environment, the ability to communicate with other entities, the ability to achieve protection against external manipulation attempts, and the ability to control and restrict the communication of other entities.",

                "Single user profile items, however, may be acquired permanently if they are unlinkable, i.e. if they cannot be attributed to a specific user or linked to other user profile items.",

                "Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.",
                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",
                "Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted.",
                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",
                "Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information. • Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party.",
                "General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique.",
                "In addition, general requirements regarding the quality of the recommendations as well as security aspects, performance and broadness of the resulting system have to be addressed as well.",
                "While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements. 3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity.",
                "The filter entity provides the recommendations, and subsequently deletes all private information, thus fulfilling the requirement regarding permanent acquisition of private information. 320 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The entities whose private information is propagated have to be certain that the respective information is actually acquired temporarily only.",
                "Trust in this regard may be established in two main ways: • Trusted Software: The respective entity itself is trusted to remove the respective information as specified. • Trusted Environment: The respective entity operates in an environment that is trusted to control the communication and life cycle of the entity to an extent that the removal of the respective information may be achieved regardless of the attempted actions of the entity itself.",

                "Reputation-based mechanisms, additional trusted third parties certifying entities or environments, or trusted computing mechanisms may be used.",
                "Our approach is based on a trusted environment realized via trusted computing mechanisms, because we see this solution as the most generic and realistic approach.",
                "This decision is discussed briefly in Section 5.",

                "Through mechanisms provided by this environment, the relay entity is able to control the communication of the TFE, and the provider entity is able to control the communication of both relay entity and the TFE.",
                "Thus, it is possible to ensure that the controlled entities are only able to propagate recommendations, but no other private information.",
                "In the first stage (steps 1.1 to 1.3 of Figure 1), the relay entity establishes control of the TFE, and thus prevents it from propagating user profile information.",

                "In the third stage (steps 3.1 to 3.5 of Figure 1), the TFE returns the recommendations via the relay entity, and the controlled entities are terminated.",
                "Taken together, these steps ensure that all private information is acquired temporarily only by the other main entities.",
                "The problems of determining acceptable queries on the provider profile and ensuring unlinkability of the recommendations are discussed in the following section.",
                "Our approach requires each entity in the distributed architecture to have the following five main abilities: The ability to perform certain well-defined tasks (such as carrying out a filtering process) with a high degree of autonomy, i.e. largely independent of other entities (e.g. because the respective entity is not able to communicate in an unrestricted manner), the ability to be deployable dynamically in a well-defined environment, the ability to communicate with other entities, the ability to achieve protection against external manipulation attempts, and the ability to control and restrict the communication of other entities.",

                "The required functionality cannot be realized based on regular agent services or components, because an agent on a platform is usually not allowed to interfere with the actions of other agents in any way.",
                "Therefore, we add additional infrastructure providing the required functionality to the MAS architecture itself, resulting in an agent environment with extended functionality and responsibilities.",
                "Controlling the communication capabilities of an agent is realized by restricting via rules, in a manner similar to a firewall, but with the consent of the respective agent, its incoming and outgoing communication to specific platforms or agents on external platforms as well as other possible communication channels, such as the file system.",
                "Consent is required because otherwise the overall security would be compromised, as attackers could arbitrarily block various communication channels.",

                "We have implemented two generic content-based filtering approaches that are applicable within our approach: A direct content-based filtering technique based on the class of item-based top-N recommendation algorithms [9] is used in cases where the user profile contains items that are also contained in the provider profile.",
                "In a preprocessing stage, i.e. prior to the actual information filtering processes, a model is generated containing the k most similar items for each provider profile item.",
                "While computationally rather complex, this approach is feasible because it has to be done only once, and it is carried out in a privacy-preserving way via interactions between the provider agent and a TFE agent.",
                "The resulting model is stored by the provider agent and can be seen as an additional part of the provider profile.",
                "In the actual information filtering process, the k most similar items are retrieved for each single user profile item via queries on the model (as described in Section 4.2.1, this is possible in a privacy-preserving way via anonymous communication).",
                "Recommendations are generated by selecting the n most frequent items from the result sets that are not already contained within the user profile.",
                "As an alternative approach applicable when the user profile contains information in addition to provider profile items, we provide a cluster-based approach in which provider profile items are clustered in a preprocessing stage via an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach.",
                "Each cluster is represented by a centroid item, and the cluster elements are either sub-clusters or, on the lowest level, the items themselves.",

                "Single user profile items, however, may be acquired permanently if they are unlinkable, i.e. if they cannot be attributed to a specific user or linked to other user profile items.",

                "Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.",
                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",
                "Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted.",
                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",
                "Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information. • Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party.",
                "General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique.",
                "In addition, general requirements regarding the quality of the recommendations as well as security aspects, performance and broadness of the resulting system have to be addressed as well.",
                "While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements. 3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity.",
                "The filter entity provides the recommendations, and subsequently deletes all private information, thus fulfilling the requirement regarding permanent acquisition of private information. 320 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The entities whose private information is propagated have to be certain that the respective information is actually acquired temporarily only.",
                "Trust in this regard may be established in two main ways: • Trusted Software: The respective entity itself is trusted to remove the respective information as specified. • Trusted Environment: The respective entity operates in an environment that is trusted to control the communication and life cycle of the entity to an extent that the removal of the respective information may be achieved regardless of the attempted actions of the entity itself.",
                "Additionally, the environment itself is trusted not to act in a malicious manner (e.g. it is trusted not to acquire and propagate the respective information itself).",

                "Reputation-based mechanisms, additional trusted third parties certifying entities or environments, or trusted computing mechanisms may be used.",
                "Our approach is based on a trusted environment realized via trusted computing mechanisms, because we see this solution as the most generic and realistic approach.",
                "This decision is discussed briefly in Section 5.",

                "Through mechanisms provided by this environment, the relay entity is able to control the communication of the TFE, and the provider entity is able to control the communication of both relay entity and the TFE.",

                "In the third stage (steps 3.1 to 3.5 of Figure 1), the TFE returns the recommendations via the relay entity, and the controlled entities are terminated.",
                "Taken together, these steps ensure that all private information is acquired temporarily only by the other main entities.",
                "The problems of determining acceptable queries on the provider profile and ensuring unlinkability of the recommendations are discussed in the following section.",
                "Our approach requires each entity in the distributed architecture to have the following five main abilities: The ability to perform certain well-defined tasks (such as carrying out a filtering process) with a high degree of autonomy, i.e. largely independent of other entities (e.g. because the respective entity is not able to communicate in an unrestricted manner), the ability to be deployable dynamically in a well-defined environment, the ability to communicate with other entities, the ability to achieve protection against external manipulation attempts, and the ability to control and restrict the communication of other entities.",

                "MAS architectures are an ideal solution for realizing a distributed system characterized by these features, because they provide agents constituting entities that are actually characterized by autonomy, mobility and the ability to communicate [26], as well as agent platforms as environments providing means to realize the security of agents.",

                "The required functionality cannot be realized based on regular agent services or components, because an agent on a platform is usually not allowed to interfere with the actions of other agents in any way.",
                "Therefore, we add additional infrastructure providing the required functionality to the MAS architecture itself, resulting in an agent environment with extended functionality and responsibilities.",
                "Controlling the communication capabilities of an agent is realized by restricting via rules, in a manner similar to a firewall, but with the consent of the respective agent, its incoming and outgoing communication to specific platforms or agents on external platforms as well as other possible communication channels, such as the file system.",
                "Consent is required because otherwise the overall security would be compromised, as attackers could arbitrarily block various communication channels.",
                "Our approach does not require controlling the communication between agents on the same platform, and therefore this aspect is not addressed.",
                "Consequently, all rules addressing communication capabilities have to be enforced across entire platforms, because otherwise a controlled agent could just use a non-controlled agent 1 In the implementation, we have used the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the symmetric encryption scheme and SHA-1 as the cryptographic hash function. 2 A recent survey on agent environments [24] concludes that aspects related to agent environments are often neglected, and does not indicate any existing work in this particular area. on the same platform as a relay for communicating with agents residing on external platforms.",

                "The implementation of the actual control mechanism depends on the actual MAS architecture.",
                "In our implementation, we have utilized methods provided via the Java Security Manager as part of the Java security model.",
                "Thus, the supervisor agent is enabled to define custom security policies, thereby granting or denying other agents access to resources required for communication with other agents as well as communication in general, such as files or sockets for TCP/IP-based communication. 4.2 Recommender Module The Recommender Module is mainly responsible for carrying out information filtering processes, according to the protocol described in Table 1.",
                "The participating entities are realized as agents, and the interactions as agent services.",
                "We assume that mechanisms for secure agent communication are available within the respective MAS architecture.",
                "Two issues have to be addressed in this module: The relevant parts of the provider profile have to be retrieved without compromising the users privacy, and the recommendations have to be propagated in a privacy-preserving way.",
                "Our solution is based on a threat model in which no main abstract entity may safely assume any other abstract entity to act in an honest manner: Each entity has to assume that other entities may attempt to obtain private information, either while following the specified protocol or even by deviating from the protocol.",
                "According to [15], we classify the former case as honest-but-curious behavior (as an example, the TFE may propagate recommendations as specified, but may additionally attempt to propagate private information), and the latter case as malicious behavior (as an example, the filter may attempt to propagate private information instead of the recommendations). 4.2.1 Retrieving the Provider Profile As outlined above, the relay agent relays data between the TFE agent and the provider agent.",
                "These agents are not allowed to communicate directly, because the TFE agent cannot be assumed to act in an honest manner.",
                "Unlike the user profile, which is usually rather small, the provider profile is often too voluminous to be propagated as a whole efficiently.",
                "A typical example is a user profile containing ratings of about 100 movies, while the provider profile contains some 10,000 movies.",
                "Retrieving only the relevant part of the provider profile, however, is problematic because it has to be done without leaking sensitive information about the user profile.",
                "Therefore, the relay agent has to analyze all queries on the provider profile, and reject potentially critical queries, such as queries containing a set of user profile items.",
                "Because the propagation of single unlinkable user profile items is assumed to be uncritical, we extend the information filtering protocol as follows: The relevant parts of the provider profile are retrieved based on single anonymous interactions between the relay and the provider.",
                "If the MAS architecture used for the implementation does not provide an infrastructure for anonymous agent communication, this feature has to be provided explicitly: The most straightforward way is to use additional relay agents deployed via 322 The Sixth Intl.",

                "Obviously, unlinkability is only achieved if multiple instances of the protocol are executed simultaneously between the provider and different users.",
                "Because agents on controlled platforms are unable to communicate anonymously with the respective controlling agent, control has to be established after the anonymous interactions have been completed.",
                "To prevent the uncontrolled relay agents from propagating provider profile data, the respective data is encrypted and the key is provided only after control has been established.",
                "Therefore, the second phase of the protocol described in Table 1 is replaced as described in Table 2.",
                "Additionally, the relay agent may allow other interactions as long as no user profile items are used within the queries.",
                "In this case, the relay agent has to ensure that the provider does not obtain any information exceeding the information deducible via the recommendations themselves.",

                "The interactions of Step 3.5 to Step 3.8 ensure, via the same mechanisms used in Step 3.1 to 3.4, that the provider is able to analyze the recommendations before the user obtains them, but at the same time prevent the provider from altering the recommendations.",

                "Again, the most straightforward way to achieve this is to use additional relay agents deployed via the user agent which are used once for a single information filtering process. 4.3 Exemplary Filtering Techniques The filtering technique applied by the TFE agent cannot be chosen freely: All collaboration-based approaches, such as collaborative filtering techniques based on the profiles of a set of users, are not applicable because the provider profile does not contain user profile data (unless this data has been collected externally).",

                "In a preprocessing stage, i.e. prior to the actual information filtering processes, a model is generated containing the k most similar items for each provider profile item.",
                "While computationally rather complex, this approach is feasible because it has to be done only once, and it is carried out in a privacy-preserving way via interactions between the provider agent and a TFE agent.",
                "The resulting model is stored by the provider agent and can be seen as an additional part of the provider profile.",
                "In the actual information filtering process, the k most similar items are retrieved for each single user profile item via queries on the model (as described in Section 4.2.1, this is possible in a privacy-preserving way via anonymous communication).",
                "Recommendations are generated by selecting the n most frequent items from the result sets that are not already contained within the user profile.",
                "As an alternative approach applicable when the user profile contains information in addition to provider profile items, we provide a cluster-based approach in which provider profile items are clustered in a preprocessing stage via an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach.",
                "Each cluster is represented by a centroid item, and the cluster elements are either sub-clusters or, on the lowest level, the items themselves.",

                "Single user profile items, however, may be acquired permanently if they are unlinkable, i.e. if they cannot be attributed to a specific user or linked to other user profile items.",

                "Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.",
                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",
                "Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted.",
                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",
                "Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information. • Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party.",
                "General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique.",
                "In addition, general requirements regarding the quality of the recommendations as well as security aspects, performance and broadness of the resulting system have to be addressed as well.",
                "While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements. 3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity.",
                "The filter entity provides the recommendations, and subsequently deletes all private information, thus fulfilling the requirement regarding permanent acquisition of private information. 320 The Sixth Intl.",
                "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) The entities whose private information is propagated have to be certain that the respective information is actually acquired temporarily only.",
                "Trust in this regard may be established in two main ways: • Trusted Software: The respective entity itself is trusted to remove the respective information as specified. • Trusted Environment: The respective entity operates in an environment that is trusted to control the communication and life cycle of the entity to an extent that the removal of the respective information may be achieved regardless of the attempted actions of the entity itself.",

                "Reputation-based mechanisms, additional trusted third parties certifying entities or environments, or trusted computing mechanisms may be used.",
                "Our approach is based on a trusted environment realized via trusted computing mechanisms, because we see this solution as the most generic and realistic approach.",

                "In the third stage (steps 3.1 to 3.5 of Figure 1), the TFE returns the recommendations via the relay entity, and the controlled entities are terminated.",
                "Taken together, these steps ensure that all private information is acquired temporarily only by the other main entities.",
                "The problems of determining acceptable queries on the provider profile and ensuring unlinkability of the recommendations are discussed in the following section.",
                "Our approach requires each entity in the distributed architecture to have the following five main abilities: The ability to perform certain well-defined tasks (such as carrying out a filtering process) with a high degree of autonomy, i.e. largely independent of other entities (e.g. because the respective entity is not able to communicate in an unrestricted manner), the ability to be deployable dynamically in a well-defined environment, the ability to communicate with other entities, the ability to achieve protection against external manipulation attempts, and the ability to control and restrict the communication of other entities.",

                "The required functionality cannot be realized based on regular agent services or components, because an agent on a platform is usually not allowed to interfere with the actions of other agents in any way.",
                "Therefore, we add additional infrastructure providing the required functionality to the MAS architecture itself, resulting in an agent environment with extended functionality and responsibilities.",
                "Controlling the communication capabilities of an agent is realized by restricting via rules, in a manner similar to a firewall, but with the consent of the respective agent, its incoming and outgoing communication to specific platforms or agents on external platforms as well as other possible communication channels, such as the file system.",
                "Consent is required because otherwise the overall security would be compromised, as attackers could arbitrarily block various communication channels.",
                "Our approach does not require controlling the communication between agents on the same platform, and therefore this aspect is not addressed.",
                "Consequently, all rules addressing communication capabilities have to be enforced across entire platforms, because otherwise a controlled agent could just use a non-controlled agent 1 In the implementation, we have used the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the symmetric encryption scheme and SHA-1 as the cryptographic hash function. 2 A recent survey on agent environments [24] concludes that aspects related to agent environments are often neglected, and does not indicate any existing work in this particular area. on the same platform as a relay for communicating with agents residing on external platforms.",

                "In our implementation, we have utilized methods provided via the Java Security Manager as part of the Java security model.",
                "Thus, the supervisor agent is enabled to define custom security policies, thereby granting or denying other agents access to resources required for communication with other agents as well as communication in general, such as files or sockets for TCP/IP-based communication. 4.2 Recommender Module The Recommender Module is mainly responsible for carrying out information filtering processes, according to the protocol described in Table 1.",
                "The participating entities are realized as agents, and the interactions as agent services.",
                "We assume that mechanisms for secure agent communication are available within the respective MAS architecture.",
                "Two issues have to be addressed in this module: The relevant parts of the provider profile have to be retrieved without compromising the users privacy, and the recommendations have to be propagated in a privacy-preserving way.",
                "Our solution is based on a threat model in which no main abstract entity may safely assume any other abstract entity to act in an honest manner: Each entity has to assume that other entities may attempt to obtain private information, either while following the specified protocol or even by deviating from the protocol.",
                "According to [15], we classify the former case as honest-but-curious behavior (as an example, the TFE may propagate recommendations as specified, but may additionally attempt to propagate private information), and the latter case as malicious behavior (as an example, the filter may attempt to propagate private information instead of the recommendations). 4.2.1 Retrieving the Provider Profile As outlined above, the relay agent relays data between the TFE agent and the provider agent.",
                "These agents are not allowed to communicate directly, because the TFE agent cannot be assumed to act in an honest manner.",
                "Unlike the user profile, which is usually rather small, the provider profile is often too voluminous to be propagated as a whole efficiently.",
                "A typical example is a user profile containing ratings of about 100 movies, while the provider profile contains some 10,000 movies.",
                "Retrieving only the relevant part of the provider profile, however, is problematic because it has to be done without leaking sensitive information about the user profile.",
                "Therefore, the relay agent has to analyze all queries on the provider profile, and reject potentially critical queries, such as queries containing a set of user profile items.",
                "Because the propagation of single unlinkable user profile items is assumed to be uncritical, we extend the information filtering protocol as follows: The relevant parts of the provider profile are retrieved based on single anonymous interactions between the relay and the provider.",
                "If the MAS architecture used for the implementation does not provide an infrastructure for anonymous agent communication, this feature has to be provided explicitly: The most straightforward way is to use additional relay agents deployed via 322 The Sixth Intl.",

                "The clusterbased filtering technique described in Section 4.3 is an example for a filtering technique operating in this manner. 4.2.2 Recommendation Propagation The propagation of the recommendations is even more problematic mainly because more participants are involved: Recommendations have to be propagated from the TFE agent via the relay and provider agent to the user agent.",
                "No participant should be able to alter the recommendations or use them for the propagation of private information.",

                "The interactions of Step 3.5 to Step 3.8 ensure, via the same mechanisms used in Step 3.1 to 3.4, that the provider is able to analyze the recommendations before the user obtains them, but at the same time prevent the provider from altering the recommendations.",

                "If the user wants these recommendations to be unlinkable to himself, the user agent has to carry out the entire protocol anonymously.",
                "Again, the most straightforward way to achieve this is to use additional relay agents deployed via the user agent which are used once for a single information filtering process. 4.3 Exemplary Filtering Techniques The filtering technique applied by the TFE agent cannot be chosen freely: All collaboration-based approaches, such as collaborative filtering techniques based on the profiles of a set of users, are not applicable because the provider profile does not contain user profile data (unless this data has been collected externally).",
                "Instead, these approaches are realized via the Matchmaker Module, which is outside the scope of this paper.",

                "Filtering techniques that are actually applicable are <br>feature-based approach</br>es, such as content-based filtering (in which profile items are compared via their attributes) and knowledge-based filtering (in which domain-specific knowledge is applied in order to match user and provider profile items).",
                "An overview of different classes and hybrid combinations of filtering techniques is given in [5].",
                "We have implemented two generic content-based filtering approaches that are applicable within our approach: A direct content-based filtering technique based on the class of item-based top-N recommendation algorithms [9] is used in cases where the user profile contains items that are also contained in the provider profile.",
                "In a preprocessing stage, i.e. prior to the actual information filtering processes, a model is generated containing the k most similar items for each provider profile item.",
                "While computationally rather complex, this approach is feasible because it has to be done only once, and it is carried out in a privacy-preserving way via interactions between the provider agent and a TFE agent.",
                "The resulting model is stored by the provider agent and can be seen as an additional part of the provider profile.",
                "In the actual information filtering process, the k most similar items are retrieved for each single user profile item via queries on the model (as described in Section 4.2.1, this is possible in a privacy-preserving way via anonymous communication).",
                "Recommendations are generated by selecting the n most frequent items from the result sets that are not already contained within the user profile.",
                "As an alternative approach applicable when the user profile contains information in addition to provider profile items, we provide a cluster-based approach in which provider profile items are clustered in a preprocessing stage via an agglomerative hierarchical clustering approach.",
                "Each cluster is represented by a centroid item, and the cluster elements are either sub-clusters or, on the lowest level, the items themselves.",
                "In the information filtering stage, the relevant items are retrieved by descending through the cluster hierarchy in the following manner: The cluster items of the highest level are retrieved independent of the user profile.",
                "By comparing these items with the user profile data, the most relevant sub-clusters are determined and retrieved in a subsequent iteration.",
                "This process is repeated until the lowest level is reached, which contains the items themselves as recommendations.",
                "Throughout the process, user profile items are never propagated to the provider as such.",
                "The information deducible about the user profile does not exceed the information deducible via the recommendations themselves (because essentially only a chain of cluster centroids leading to the recommendations is retrieved), and therefore it is not regarded as privacy-critical. 4.4 Implementation We have implemented the approach for privacy-preserving IF based on JIAC IV [12], a FIPA-compliant MAS architecture.",

                "In this paper, we focus on aspects related to the information filtering process itself, and omit all aspects related to information collection and processing, i.e. the stages in which profiles are generated and maintained, mainly because these stages are less critical with regard to privacy, as they involve fewer different entities. 3.1 Requirements Our solution aims at meeting the following requirements with regard to privacy: • User Privacy: No linkable information about user profiles should be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party, including other user entities.",
                "Single user profile items, however, may be acquired permanently if they are unlinkable, i.e. if they cannot be attributed to a specific user or linked to other user profile items.",

                "Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.",
                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",
                "Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted.",
                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",
                "Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information. • Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party.",
                "General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique.",

                "While minor trade-offs may be acceptable, the resulting system should reach a level similar to regular Recommender Systems with regard to these requirements. 3.2 Outline of the Solution The basic idea for realizing a protocol fulfilling these privacy-related requirements in Recommender Systems is implied by allowing the temporary acquisition of private information (see [8] for the original approach): User and provider entity both propagate the respective profile data to the filter entity.",

                "Sets of recommendations may be acquired permanently by the provider, but they should not be linkable to a specific user.",
                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",
                "Again, temporary acquisition of private information is permitted.",
                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",
                "Thus, the provider is enabled to prevent misuse such as the automatic large-scale extraction of information. • Filter Privacy: Details of the algorithms applied by the filtering techniques should not be acquired permanently by any other entity or external party.",
                "General information about the algorithm may be provided by the filter entity in order to help other entities to reach a decision on whether to apply the respective filtering technique.",

                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",

                "These concessions simplify the resulting protocol and allow the provider to obtain recommendations and single unlinkable user profile items, and thus to determine frequently requested information and optimize the offered information accordingly. • Provider Privacy: No information about provider profiles, with the exception of the recommendations, should be acquired permanently by other entities or external parties.",

                "Additionally, the propagation of provider information is entirely under the control of the provider.",
