A major deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user modeling and are not adaptive to individual users, resulting in inherently non-optimal retrieval performance. For example, a tourist and a programmer may use the same word java to search for different information, but the current search systems would return the same results. In this paper, we study how to infer a users interest from the users search context and use the inferred implicit user model for personalized search . We present a decision theoretic framework and develop techniques for implicit user modeling in information retrieval. We develop an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that can perform eager implicit feedback, e.g., query expansion based on previous queries and immediate result reranking based on clickthrough information.

INTRODUCTION Although many information retrieval systems (e.g., web search engines and digital library systems) have been successfully deployed, the current retrieval systems are far from optimal. A major deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user modeling and are not adaptive to individual users [17]. This inherent non-optimality is seen clearly in the following two cases: (1) Different users may use exactly the same query (e.g., Java) to search for different information (e.g., the Java island in Indonesia or the Java programming language), but existing IR systems return the same results for these users. Without considering the actual user, it is impossible to know which sense Java refers to in a query. (2) A users information needs may change over time. The same user may use Java sometimes to mean the Java island in Indonesia and some other times to mean the programming language. Without recognizing the search context, it would be again impossible to recognize the correct sense. In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model the user appropriately and personalize search according to each individual user. The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a users information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task. Indeed, it is even hard for a user to precisely describe what his/her information need is. What information is available for a system to infer a users information need? Obviously, the users query provides the most direct evidence. Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on the query to model a users information need. However, since a query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished . An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents. This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20]. Unfortunately, in real world applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to provide relevant examples for feedback [11]. It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort. Indeed, several previous studies have shown that implicit user modeling can improve retrieval accuracy. In [3], a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a users explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time, mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback). It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need. In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking of search results that suits a group of users preferences. In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information. For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information. In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful. Consider the query Java again. Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times. To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work. In this paper, we study how to construct and update a user model based on the immediate search context and implicit feedback information and use the model to improve the accuracy of ad-hoc retrieval. In order to maximally benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling, we propose to perform eager implicit feedback. That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model. We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function. In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values. As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display. In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user. The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general. We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user. Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google). Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google. Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort. Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user. The remaining sections are organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss the related work. In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling. In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback. In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent. Section 6 concludes our work. 2. RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions. Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike. In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts. Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side. There are two remarkable advantages on this. First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26]. Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9]. There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13]. UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session. UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion. Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query. These two techniques may be combined. 3. OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action. For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries. In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system. In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need. Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response. When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal. For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task. Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated. We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work. Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A. At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions. The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at. Let M be the space of all possible user models. We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model. L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a. According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1). We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t . That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1). Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ). When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t . Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses. In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model. When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do. However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results. In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback. These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model. We now discuss two important components in a user model. The first component is a component model of the users information need. Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need. Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi. Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents. For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21]. In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need. Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in. The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed. Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again. We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed. In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history. Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation. If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x. That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1). This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later. In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific. We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them. Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need. We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m). Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable. One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable. To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value. Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18]. Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities. For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function. We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement. When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search. In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine. The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement. Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q. Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q. Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q. Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q). A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy. In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity. Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is. Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling. We now discuss a few of them. First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation. For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results. The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model. Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents. When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document. We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ . Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20]. Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not. Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document. Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems. In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4. UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling. UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines. Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines. The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search. For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application. This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside. Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server. Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients. As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated. In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page. For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x. Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x. Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries). Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features. Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries. Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text. Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related. For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score. We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process. To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results). The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows. Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries. We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si. We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n. The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session. If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results. Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query. In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query. Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk. We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]). According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21]. Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector. That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model. In our experiments, α is set to 0.5. Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated. Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer. In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately. To rerank any unseen document summaries, UCAIR uses the standard vector space retrieval model and scores each summary based on the similarity of the result and the current user information need vector x [21]. Since implicit feedback is not completely reliable, we bring up only a small number (e.g. 5) of highest reranked results to be followed by any originally high ranked results. 828 Google result (user query = java map) UCAIR result (user query =java map) previous query = travel Indonesia previous query = hashtable expanded user query = java map Indonesia expanded user query = java map class 1 Java map projections of the world ...

Table 1: Sample results of query expansion 5. EVALUATION OF UCAIR We now present some results on evaluating the two major UCAIR functions: selective query expansion and result reranking based on user clickthrough data. 5.1 Sample results The query expansion strategy implemented in UCAIR is intentionally conservative to avoid misinterpretation of implicit user models. In practice, whenever it chooses to expand the query, the expansion usually makes sense. In Table 1, we show how UCAIR can successfully distinguish two different search contexts for the query java map, corresponding to two different previous queries (i.e., travel Indonesia vs. hashtable). Due to implicit user modeling, UCAIR intelligently figures out to add Indonesia and class, respectively, to the users query java map, which would otherwise be ambiguous as shown in the original results from Google on March 21, 2005. UCAIRs results are much more accurate than Googles results and reflect personalization in search. The eager implicit feedback component is designed to immediately respond to a users activity such as viewing a document. In Figure 2, we show how UCAIR can successfully disambiguate an ambiguous query jaguar by exploiting a viewed document summary. In this case, the initial retrieval results using jaguar (shown on the left side) contain two results about the Jaguar cars followed by two results about the Jaguar software. However, after the user views the web page content of the second result (about Jaguar car) and returns to the search result page by clicking Back button, UCAIR automatically nominates two new search results about Jaguar cars (shown on the right side), while the original two results about Jaguar software are pushed down on the list (unseen from the picture). 5.2 Quantitative evaluation To further evaluate UCAIR quantitatively, we conduct a user study on the effectiveness of the eager implicit feedback component. It is a challenge to quantitatively evaluate the potential performance improvement of our proposed model and UCAIR over Google in an unbiased way [7]. Here, we design a user study, in which participants would do normal web search and judge a randomly and anonymously mixed set of results from Google and UCAIR at the end of the search session; participants do not know whether a result comes from Google or UCAIR. We recruited 6 graduate students for this user study, who have different backgrounds (3 computer science, 2 biology, and 1 chem<top> <num> Number: 716 <title> Spammer arrest sue <desc> Description: Have any spammers been arrested or sued for sending unsolicited e-mail? <narr> Narrative: Instances of arrests, prosecutions, convictions, and punishments of spammers, and lawsuits against them are relevant.

We use query topics from TREC 2 2004 Terabyte track [2] and TREC 2003 Web track [4] topic distillation task in the way to be described below. An example topic from TREC 2004 Terabyte track appears in Figure 3. The title is a short phrase and may be used as a query to the retrieval system. The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question. Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph. Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics. For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query. During this process, the participant may view the search results and possibly click on some interesting ones to view the web pages, just as in a normal web search. There is no requirement or restriction on how many queries the participant must submit or when the participant should stop the search for one topic. When the participant plans to change the search topic, he/she will simply press a button 2 Text REtrieval Conference: http://trec.nist.gov/ 829 Figure 2: Screen shots for result reranking to evaluate the search results before actually switching to the next topic. At the time of evaluation, 30 top ranked results from Google and UCAIR (some are overlapping) are randomly mixed together so that the participant would not know whether a result comes from Google or UCAIR. The participant would then judge the relevance of these results. We measure precision at top n (n = 5, 10, 20, 30) documents of Google and UCAIR. We also evaluate precisions at different recall levels. Altogether, 368 documents judged as relevant from Google search results and 429 documents judged as relevant from UCAIR by participants. Scatter plots of precision at top 10 and top 20 documents are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively (The scatter plot of precision at top 30 documents is very similar to precision at top 20 documents). Each point of the scatter plots represents the precisions of Google and UCAIR on one query topic. Table 2 shows the average precision at top n documents among 32 topics. From Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table 2, we see that the search results from UCAIR are consistently better than those from Google by all the measures. Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents. One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect. Thus the retrieval system can build more precise implicit user models, which lead to better retrieval accuracy.

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we studied how to exploit implicit user modeling to intelligently personalize information retrieval and improve search accuracy. Unlike most previous work, we emphasize the use of immediate search context and implicit feedback information as well as eager updating of search results to maximally benefit a user. We presented a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function. We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user. Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent (UCAIR) on top of a popular search engine (Google). Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over 830 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 UCAIR prec@20 Googleprec@20 Scatterplot of Precision at Top 20 documents Figure 5: Precision at top 20 documents of UCAIR and Google 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 recall precision Precision−Recall curves Google Result UCAIR Result Figure 6: Precision at top 20 result of UCAIR and Google Google. Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort. The developed search agent thus can improve existing web search performance without any additional effort from the user. 7.

Una deficiencia importante de los sistemas de recuperación existentes es que generalmente carecen de modelado de usuarios y no se adaptan a los usuarios individuales, lo que resulta en un rendimiento de recuperación inherentemente no óptimo. Por ejemplo, un turista y un programador pueden usar la misma palabra Java para buscar información diferente, pero los sistemas de búsqueda actuales devolverían los mismos resultados. En este documento, estudiamos cómo inferir el interés de los usuarios en el contexto de búsqueda de usuarios y utilizar el modelo de usuario implícito inferido para la búsqueda personalizada. Presentamos un marco teórico de decisión y desarrollamos técnicas para el modelado implícito de usuarios en la recuperación de información. Desarrollamos un agente de búsqueda web inteligente del lado del cliente (UCAIR) que puede realizar comentarios ansiosos implícitos, por ejemplo, expansión de consultas basada en consultas anteriores y resultados de resultados inmediatos en función de la información de clics.

Categorías y descriptores de sujetos H.3.3 [Búsqueda y recuperación de información]: modelos de recuperación, retroalimentación de relevancia, proceso de búsqueda de términos generales Algoritmos 1. Introducción Aunque muchos sistemas de recuperación de información (por ejemplo, motores de búsqueda web y sistemas de biblioteca digital) se han implementado con éxito, los sistemas de recuperación actuales están lejos de ser óptimos. Una deficiencia importante de los sistemas de recuperación existentes es que generalmente carecen de modelado de usuarios y no se adaptan a los usuarios individuales [17]. Esta no óptima inherente se ve claramente en los siguientes dos casos: (1) diferentes usuarios pueden usar exactamente la misma consulta (por ejemplo, Java) para buscar información diferente (por ejemplo, la isla Java en Indonesia o el lenguaje de programación de Java),Pero los sistemas IR existentes devuelven los mismos resultados para estos usuarios. Sin considerar al usuario real, es imposible saber a qué sentido se refiere Java en una consulta.(2) Las necesidades de información de los usuarios pueden cambiar con el tiempo. El mismo usuario puede usar Java a veces para significar la isla Java en Indonesia y otras veces para significar el lenguaje de programación. Sin reconocer el contexto de búsqueda, sería nuevamente imposible reconocer el sentido correcto. Para optimizar la precisión de la recuperación, claramente necesitamos modelar al usuario de manera adecuada y personalizar la búsqueda de acuerdo con cada usuario individual. El objetivo principal del modelado de usuarios para la recuperación de la información es modelar con precisión una necesidad de información de los usuarios, lo cual es, desafortunadamente, una tarea muy difícil. De hecho, es difícil para un usuario describir con precisión cuál es su información. ¿Qué información está disponible para un sistema para inferir la necesidad de la información del usuario? Obviamente, la consulta de usuarios proporciona la evidencia más directa. De hecho, la mayoría de los sistemas de recuperación existentes dependen únicamente de la consulta para modelar una necesidad de información del usuario. Sin embargo, dado que una consulta a menudo es extremadamente corta, el modelo de usuario construido en función de una consulta de palabras clave está inevitablemente empobrecida. Una forma efectiva de mejorar el modelado de los usuarios en la recuperación de la información es pedirle al usuario que especifique explícitamente qué documentos son relevantes (es decir, útiles para satisfacer su necesidad de información) y luego mejorar el modelado del usuario en función de tales ejemplos de documentos relevantes. Esto se llama retroalimentación de relevancia, que se ha demostrado que es bastante efectivo para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación [19, 20]. Desafortunadamente, en las aplicaciones del mundo real, los usuarios generalmente son reacios a hacer el esfuerzo adicional para proporcionar ejemplos relevantes para la retroalimentación [11]. Por lo tanto, es muy interesante estudiar cómo inferir la necesidad de la información de los usuarios en función de cualquier información de retroalimentación implícita, que naturalmente existe a través de las interacciones del usuario y, por lo tanto, no requiere ningún esfuerzo adicional del usuario. De hecho, varios estudios anteriores han demostrado que el modelado implícito de los usuarios puede mejorar la precisión de la recuperación. En [3], se desarrolla un navegador web (navegador curioso) para registrar las clasificaciones de relevancia explícita de los usuarios de las páginas web (retroalimentación de relevancia) y el comportamiento de navegación al ver una página, como la hora de la vivienda, el clic del mouse, el movimiento del mouse y el desplazamiento (implícitocomentario). Se muestra que el tiempo de vivienda en una página, la cantidad de desplazamiento en una página y la combinación de tiempo y desplazamiento tienen una fuerte correlación con calificaciones de relevancia explícita, lo que sugiere que la retroalimentación implícita puede ser útil para inferir la necesidad de la información del usuario. En [10], los datos de clics del usuario se recopilan como datos de capacitación para aprender una función de recuperación, que se utiliza para producir una clasificación personalizada de resultados de búsqueda que se adapte a un grupo de preferencias de usuarios. En [25], los datos de clics recopilados durante un largo período de tiempo se explotan a través de la expansión de la consulta para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación.824 Si bien un usuario puede tener intereses y preferencias generales a largo plazo por información, a menudo está buscando documentos para satisfacer una necesidad de información ad-hoc, que solo dura un corto período de tiempo;Una vez que se satisfaga la necesidad de la información, el usuario generalmente ya no estaría interesado en dicha información. Por ejemplo, un usuario puede estar buscando información sobre los automóviles usados para comprar uno, pero una vez que el usuario ha comprado un automóvil, generalmente ya no está interesado en dicha información. En tales casos, es poco probable que la información de retroalimentación implícita recopilada durante un largo período de tiempo sea muy útil, pero se puede esperar que el contexto de búsqueda inmediata y la información de retroalimentación, como cuáles de los resultados de búsqueda para la información actual.mucho más útil. Considere la consulta Java nuevamente. Cualquiera de la siguiente información de comentarios inmediatos sobre el usuario podría ayudar a determinar el significado previsto de Java en la consulta: (1) La consulta anterior presentada por el usuario es hashtable (a diferencia de, por ejemplo, Viaje Indonesia).(2) En los resultados de la búsqueda, el usuario vio una página donde las palabras como la programación, el software y el applet ocurren muchas veces. Hasta donde sabemos, cómo explotar dicho contexto de búsqueda inmediata y a corto plazo para mejorar la búsqueda hasta ahora no se ha abordado bien en el trabajo anterior. En este documento, estudiamos cómo construir y actualizar un modelo de usuario basado en el contexto de búsqueda inmediata y la información de retroalimentación implícita y usar el modelo para mejorar la precisión de la recuperación ad-hoc. Para beneficiar al tanto al usuario de un sistema de recuperación a través del modelado implícito de los usuarios, proponemos realizar comentarios ansiosos implícitos. Es decir, tan pronto como observamos cualquier nueva evidencia del usuario, actualizaríamos la creencia de los sistemas sobre la necesidad de la información de los usuarios y respondemos con resultados de recuperación mejorados basados en el modelo de usuario actualizado. Presentamos un marco teórico de decisión para optimizar la recuperación de información interactiva basada en una actualización de modelo de usuario ansiosa, en el que el sistema responde a cada acción del usuario eligiendo una acción del sistema para optimizar una función de utilidad. En un paradigma de recuperación tradicional, el problema de recuperación es igualar una consulta con documentos y documentos de rango de acuerdo con sus valores de relevancia. Como resultado, el proceso de recuperación es un ciclo independiente simple de consulta y visualización de resultados. En el nuevo paradigma de recuperación propuesto, el contexto de búsqueda de usuarios juega un papel importante y el modelo de usuario implícito inferido se explota de inmediato para beneficiar al usuario. El nuevo paradigma de recuperación es, por lo tanto, fundamentalmente diferente del paradigma tradicional, y es inherentemente más general. Además, proponemos técnicas específicas para capturar y explotar dos tipos de información de retroalimentación implícita: (1) Identificar la consulta inmediatamente anterior y utilizada de la consulta y los resultados de búsqueda correspondientes para seleccionar los términos apropiados para expandir la consulta actual, y (2) explotar la vista vistaDocumente resúmenes para volver a revisar inmediatamente cualquier documento que el usuario aún no haya visto. Usando estas técnicas, desarrollamos un agente de búsqueda web del lado del cliente UCAIR (recuperación de información adaptativa centrada en el usuario) además de un motor de búsqueda popular (Google). Los experimentos en la búsqueda web muestran que nuestro agente de búsqueda puede mejorar la precisión de búsqueda en Google. Dado que la información implícita que explotamos ya existe naturalmente a través de las interacciones del usuario, el usuario no necesita hacer ningún esfuerzo adicional. Por lo tanto, el agente de búsqueda desarrollado puede mejorar el rendimiento de búsqueda web existente sin un esfuerzo adicional del usuario. Las secciones restantes se organizan de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, discutimos el trabajo relacionado. En la Sección 3, presentamos un marco de recuperación interactiva teórica de decisión para el modelado implícito de usuarios. En la Sección 4, presentamos el diseño e implementación de un agente de búsqueda web inteligente del lado del cliente (UCAIR) que realiza comentarios ansiosos implícitos. En la Sección 5, informamos los resultados de nuestros experimentos utilizando el agente de búsqueda. La Sección 6 concluye nuestro trabajo.2. Trabajo relacionado Modelado implícito de usuarios para búsqueda personalizada se ha estudiado en trabajos anteriores, pero nuestro trabajo difiere de todos los trabajos anteriores en varios aspectos: (1) enfatizamos la explotación del contexto de búsqueda inmediata, como la consulta inmediatamente anterior.La misma sesión, mientras que la mayoría del trabajo anterior se basa en la recopilación a largo plazo de información de retroalimentación implícita [25].(2) Realizamos comentarios ansiosos y brindamos el beneficio del modelado implícito de los usuarios tan pronto como cualquier nueva información de retroalimentación implícita esté disponible, mientras que el trabajo anterior explota principalmente comentarios implícitos a largo plazo [10].(3) Proponemos un marco de recuperación para integrar el modelado implícito de los usuarios con el proceso de recuperación interactivo, mientras que el trabajo anterior estudia modelado implícito de usuarios por separado de la recuperación [3] o solo estudia modelos de recuperación específicos para explotar la retroalimentación implícita para igualar una consulta con una consulta conDocumentos [23, 27, 22].(4) Desarrollamos y evaluamos un agente de búsqueda web personalizado con estudios de usuarios en línea, mientras que la mayoría del trabajo existente evalúa los algoritmos fuera de línea sin interacciones reales del usuario. Actualmente, algunos motores de búsqueda proporcionan personalización rudimentaria, como la búsqueda web personalizada de Google [6], que permite a los usuarios describir explícitamente sus intereses seleccionando de temas predefinidos, de modo que esos resultados que coincidan con sus intereses se llevan a la cima y mi Yahoo!Buscar [16], que brinda a los usuarios la opción de guardar los sitios web que les gustan y bloquear a los que no les gustan. En contraste, UCAIR personaliza la búsqueda web a través del modelado de usuarios implícito sin ningún esfuerzo de usuario adicional. Además, la personalización de UCAIR se proporciona en el lado del cliente. Hay dos ventajas notables sobre esto. Primero, el usuario no necesita preocuparse por la infracción de privacidad, lo cual es una gran preocupación para la búsqueda personalizada [26]. En segundo lugar, tanto el cálculo de la personalización como el almacenamiento del perfil de usuario se realizan en el lado del cliente para que la carga del servidor se reduzca drásticamente [9]. Ha habido muchos trabajos que estudian registros de consultas de usuario [1] o dinámica de consultas [13]. UCAIR hace un uso directo de un historial de consultas de usuarios para beneficiar al mismo usuario inmediatamente en la misma sesión de búsqueda. UCAIR primero juzga si dos consultas vecinas pertenecen a la misma sesión de información y, de ser así, selecciona los términos de la consulta anterior para realizar la expansión de la consulta. Nuestro enfoque de expansión de la consulta es similar a la expansión automática de consultas [28, 15, 5], pero en lugar de usar pseudo retroalimentación para expandir la consulta, utilizamos la información de retroalimentación implícita de los usuarios para expandir la consulta actual. Estas dos técnicas pueden combinarse.3. Optimización en IR interactivo en IR Interactive, un usuario interactúa con el sistema de recuperación a través de un diálogo de acción, en el que el sistema responde a cada acción del usuario con alguna acción del sistema. Por ejemplo, la acción de los usuarios puede estar enviando una consulta y la respuesta de los sistemas puede devolver una lista de 10 resúmenes de documentos. En general, el espacio de las acciones del usuario y las respuestas del sistema y sus granularidades dependerían de la interfaz de un sistema de recuperación particular. En principio, cada acción del usuario puede proporcionar una nueva evidencia para ayudar al sistema a inferir mejor que la necesidad de la información del usuario. Por lo tanto, para responder de manera óptima, el sistema debe usar toda la evidencia recopilada hasta ahora sobre el usuario al elegir una respuesta. Cuando se ve de esta manera, la mayoría de los motores de búsqueda existentes son claramente no óptimos. Por ejemplo, si un usuario ha visto algunos documentos en la primera página de los resultados de búsqueda, cuando el usuario hace clic en el siguiente enlace para obtener más resultados, un sistema de recuperación existente aún devolvería la siguiente página de resultados recuperados en función de la consulta original sinTeniendo en cuenta la nueva evidencia de que el usuario ha visto un resultado particular.825 Proponemos optimizar el rendimiento de la recuperación mediante la adaptación de las respuestas del sistema en función de cada acción que haya tomado un usuario, y emitir el problema de optimización como una tarea de decisión. Específicamente, en cualquier momento, el sistema intentaría hacer dos tareas: (1) Actualización del modelo de usuario: monitoree cualquier evidencia útil del usuario con respecto a su necesidad de información y actualice el modelo de usuario tan pronto como dicha evidencia esté disponible;(2) Mejora de los resultados de la búsqueda: vuelva a estar inmediatamente todos los documentos que el usuario aún no ha visto, tan pronto como se actualiza el modelo de usuario. Hacemos hincapié en la actualización ansiosa y la resonancia, lo que hace que nuestro trabajo sea bastante diferente de cualquier trabajo existente. A continuación presentamos un marco teórico de decisión formal para optimizar el rendimiento de la recuperación a través del modelado implícito de usuarios en la recuperación de información interactiva.3.1 Un marco teórico de decisión de que A sea el conjunto de todas las acciones del usuario y r (a) sea el conjunto de todas las respuestas del sistema posibles a una acción del usuario a ∈ A. En cualquier momento, deje que AT = (a1, ..., at) sea la secuencia observada de acciones del usuario hasta ahora (hasta el punto de tiempo t) y rt - 1 = (r1, ..., rt - 1) ser elRespuestas que el sistema ha respondido a las acciones del usuario. El objetivo de los sistemas es elegir una respuesta óptima rt ∈ R (AT) para la acción del usuario actual AT. Sea M el espacio de todos los modelos de usuarios posibles. Definimos además una función de pérdida l (a, r, m) ∈, donde a ∈ A es una acción del usuario, r ∈ R (a) es una respuesta del sistema, y m ∈ M es un modelo de usuario. L (A, R, M) codifica nuestras preferencias de decisión y evalúa la optimización de responder con R cuando el modelo de usuario actual es M y la acción actual del usuario es a. Según la teoría de la decisión bayesiana, la decisión óptima en el momento t es elegir una respuesta que minimice el riesgo de Bayes, es decir, r ∗ t = argmin r∈R (at) m l (at, r, mt) p (mt | u,D, at, rt - 1) dmt (1) donde p (mt | u, d, at, rt - 1) es la probabilidad posterior del modelo de usuario mt dada todas las observaciones sobre el usuario que hemos hecho hasta el tiempot.Para simplificar el cálculo de la ecuación 1, supongamos que la masa de probabilidad posterior P (mt | u, d, at, rt - 1) se concentra principalmente en el modo m ∗ t = argmaxmt p (mt | u, d, at, a, Rt - 1). Luego podemos aproximar la integral con el valor de la función de pérdida en m ∗ t. Es decir, r ∗ t ≈ argminr∈R (at) l (at, r, m ∗ t) (2) donde m ∗ t = argmaxmt p (mt | u, d, at, rt - 1). Dejando de lado cómo definir y estimar estos modelos probabilísticos y la función de pérdida, podemos ver que dicha formulación teórica de decisión sugiere que, para elegir la respuesta óptima a AT, el sistema debe realizar dos tareas: (1) Calcule laModelo de usuario actual y obtener M ∗ T basado en toda la información útil.(2) Elija una respuesta RT para minimizar el valor de la función de pérdida L (AT, RT, M ∗ T). Cuando AT no afecta nuestra creencia sobre M ∗ t, el primer paso se puede omitir y podemos reutilizar M ∗ t - 1 para m ∗ t. Tenga en cuenta que nuestro marco es bastante general ya que podemos modelar cualquier tipo de acciones de usuario y respuestas del sistema. En la mayoría de los casos, como esperamos, la respuesta de los sistemas es una clasificación de documentos, es decir, para la mayoría de las acciones A, R (a) consiste en todas las clasificaciones posibles de los documentos invisibles, y el problema de decisión se reduce a elegir lo mejorClasificación de documentos invisibles basados en el modelo de usuario más actual. Cuando A es la acción de enviar una consulta de palabras clave, dicha respuesta es exactamente lo que haría un sistema de recuperación actual. Sin embargo, podemos imaginar fácilmente que un motor de búsqueda web más inteligente respondería a los usuarios haciendo clic en el siguiente enlace (para obtener resultados más invisibles) con una clasificación más optimizada de documentos basados en cualquier documento visto en la página actual de resultados. De hecho, de acuerdo con nuestra ansiosa estrategia de actualización, incluso podemos permitir que un sistema responda a los usuarios que hacen clic en el botón de retroceso de los navegadores después de ver un documento de la misma manera, para que el usuario pueda beneficiarse al máximo de la retroalimentación implícita. Estos son precisamente lo que hace nuestro sistema UCAIR.3.2 Modelos de usuario Un modelo de usuario M ∈ M representa lo que sabemos sobre el usuario U, por lo que, en principio, puede contener cualquier información sobre el usuario que deseamos modelar. Ahora discutimos dos componentes importantes en un modelo de usuario. El primer componente es un modelo de componente de la necesidad de información del usuario. Presumiblemente, el factor más importante que afecta la optimización de la respuesta de los sistemas es qué tan bien la respuesta aborda la información de los usuarios que necesita. De hecho, en cualquier momento, podemos suponer que el sistema cree en lo que el usuario está interesado, que modelamos a través de un término vector x = (x1, ..., x | v |), donde v = {w1, ..., W | V |} es el conjunto de todos los términos (es decir, vocabulario) y xi es el peso del término wi. Tal vector de término se usa comúnmente en la recuperación de información para representar consultas y documentos. Por ejemplo, el modelo Vector-Space, supone que tanto la consulta como los documentos se representan como vectores de término y la puntuación de un documento con respecto a una consulta se calcula en función de la similitud entre el vector de consulta y el vector de documento [21]. En un enfoque de modelado de idiomas, también podemos considerar el modelo de lenguaje unigram de consulta [12, 29] o el modelo de relevancia [14] como una representación vectorial de término de la necesidad de información de los usuarios. Intuitivamente, X asignaría altos pesos a los términos que caracterizan los temas que el usuario está interesado. El segundo componente que podemos incluir en nuestro modelo de usuario son los documentos que el usuario ya ha visto. Obviamente, incluso si un documento es relevante, si el usuario ya ha visto el documento, no sería útil presentar el mismo documento nuevamente. Por lo tanto, introducimos otra variable S ⊂ D (d es el conjunto completo de documentos en la colección) para denotar el subconjunto de documentos en los resultados de búsqueda que el usuario ya ha visto/visto. En general, en el momento t, podemos representar un modelo de usuario como mt = (s, x, at, rt - 1), donde s es los documentos vistos, x es la comprensión de los sistemas de la necesidad de información de los usuarios y (at, en,RT - 1) representa el historial de interacción de los usuarios. Tenga en cuenta que un modelo de usuario aún más general también puede incluir otros factores, como el nivel de lectura de los usuarios y la ocupación. Si suponemos que la incertidumbre de un modelo de usuario MT se debe únicamente a la incertidumbre de X, el cálculo de nuestra estimación actual del modelo de usuario M ∗ t implicará principalmente calcular nuestra mejor estimación de x. Es decir, el sistema elegiría una respuesta de acuerdo con r ∗ t = argminr∈R (at) l (at, r, s, x ∗, at, rt - 1) (3) donde x ∗ = argmaxx p (x |U, d, at, rt - 1). Este es el mecanismo de decisión implementado en el sistema UCAIR que se describirá más adelante. En este sistema, evitamos especificar el modelo probabilístico P (X | U, D, AT, RT - 1) calculando X ∗ directamente con algún método de retroalimentación existente.3.3 Funciones de pérdida La definición exacta de la función de pérdida L depende de las respuestas, por lo tanto, es inevitablemente específico de la aplicación. Ahora discutimos brevemente algunas posibilidades cuando la respuesta es clasificar todos los documentos invisibles y presentar el Top K de ellos. Sea r = (d1, ..., dk) los principales documentos k, s como el conjunto de documentos vistos por parte del usuario y x ∗ sea la mejor suposición de los sistemas que la información de los usuarios necesita. 826 podemos simplemente definir la pérdida asociada con R como la suma negativa de la probabilidad de que cada DI sea relevante, es decir, L (a, r, m) = - k i = 1 p (relevante | di, m). Claramente, para minimizar esta función de pérdida, la respuesta óptima R contendría los documentos K con la mayor probabilidad de relevancia, que es intuitivamente razonable. Una deficiencia de esta función de pérdida de Top-K es que no es sensible al orden interno de los documentos K superiores seleccionados, por lo que cambiar el orden de clasificación de un documento no relevante y uno relevante no afectaría la pérdida, lo cual no es razonable. Para la clasificación del modelo, podemos introducir un factor del modelo de usuario: la probabilidad de que cada uno de los documentos K vistas por el usuario, p (Ver | DI) y definir la siguiente función de pérdida de ranking: L (A, R, M) = - k i = 1 p (ver | di) p (relevante | di, m) ya que en general, si di se clasifica arriba dj (es decir, i <j), p (ver | di)> p (ver | dj), esta función de pérdida favorecería la decisión de clasificar los documentos relevantes por encima de los no relevantes, como de lo contrario, siempre podríamos cambiar DI con DJ para reducir el valor de pérdida. Por lo tanto, el sistema debe simplemente realizar una recuperación regular y clasificar documentos de acuerdo con la probabilidad de relevancia [18]. Dependiendo de las preferencias de recuperación de los usuarios, puede haber muchas otras posibilidades. Por ejemplo, si el usuario no desea ver documentos redundantes, la función de pérdida debe incluir una medida de redundancia en R basada en los documentos ya vistos S. Por supuesto, cuando la respuesta no es elegir una lista clasificada de documentos, lo haríamos.Necesita una función de pérdida diferente. Discutimos un ejemplo de este tipo que es relevante para el agente de búsqueda que implementamos. Cuando un usuario ingresa a una consulta QT (acción actual), nuestro agente de búsqueda se basa en algún motor de búsqueda existente para llevar a cabo realmente la búsqueda. En tal caso, a pesar de que el agente de búsqueda no tiene control del algoritmo de recuperación, aún puede intentar optimizar los resultados de búsqueda mediante la refinación de la consulta enviada al motor de búsqueda y/o volver a hacer los resultados obtenidos del motor de búsqueda. Las funciones de pérdida para el rehabilitación ya se discuten anteriormente;Ahora echamos un vistazo a las funciones de pérdida para el refinamiento de la consulta. Sea f la función de recuperación del motor de búsqueda que usa nuestro agente para que F (Q) nos dé los resultados de búsqueda utilizando la consulta q. Dado que la acción actual del usuario está ingresando una consulta Qt (es decir, AT = Qt), nuestra respuesta sería f (q) para algunos q. Como no tenemos otra opción de F, nuestra decisión es elegir una buena q. Formalmente, r ∗ t = argminrt l (a, rt, m) = argminf (q) l (a, f (q), m) = f (argMinql (qt, f (q), m)) que muestra que nuestro nuestroEl objetivo es encontrar Q ∗ = ArgMinql (Qt, F (Q), M), es decir, una consulta óptima que nos daría lo mejor F (Q). Una opción diferente de la función de pérdida L (Qt, F (Q), M) conduciría a una estrategia de refinamiento de consulta diferente. En UCAIR, calculamos heurísticamente Q ∗ expandiendo el QT con términos extraídos de RT - 1 siempre que QT - 1 y QT tengan una alta similitud. Tenga en cuenta que RT - 1 y QT - 1 están contenidos en M como parte del historial de interacción de los usuarios.3.4 Modelado implícito de usuarios El modelado de usuarios implícitos se captura en nuestro marco a través del cálculo de x ∗ = argmaxx p (x | u, d, at, rt - 1), es decir, la creencia actual de los sistemas de lo que la información de los usuarios necesita es. Aquí nuevamente puede haber muchas posibilidades, lo que lleva a diferentes algoritmos para el modelado de usuarios implícitos. Ahora discutimos algunos de ellos. Primero, cuando se relacionan dos consultas consecutivas, la consulta anterior se puede explotar para enriquecer la consulta actual y proporcionar más contexto de búsqueda para ayudar a la desambiguación. Para este propósito, en lugar de realizar la expansión de la consulta como lo hicimos en la sección anterior, también podríamos calcular una X ∗ actualizada basada en los resultados de consulta y recuperación anteriores. El nuevo modelo de usuario calculado se puede utilizar para clasificar los documentos con un modelo de recuperación de información estándar. En segundo lugar, también podemos inferir el interés de los usuarios en función de los resúmenes de los documentos vistos. Cuando se presenta a un usuario una lista de resúmenes de los documentos clasificados, si el usuario elige omitir los primeros documentos n y ver el documento (n+1), podemos inferir que el usuario no está interesado en la muestra que se muestraResúmenes para los primeros n documentos, pero se siente atraído por el resumen mostrado del documento (n + 1) -th. Por lo tanto, podemos usar estos resúmenes como ejemplos negativos y positivos para aprender un modelo de usuario más preciso X ∗. Aquí se pueden explotar muchas técnicas de retroalimentación de relevancia estándar [19, 20]. Tenga en cuenta que debemos usar los resúmenes mostrados, a diferencia del contenido real de esos documentos, ya que es posible que el resumen mostrado del documento visto sea relevante, pero el contenido del documento en realidad no lo es. Del mismo modo, un resumen mostrado puede engañar a un usuario para omitir un documento relevante. Inferir modelos de usuario basados en dicha información mostrada, en lugar del contenido real de un documento es una diferencia importante entre UCAIR y algunos otros sistemas similares. En UCAIR, se implementan ambas estrategias para inferir un modelo de usuario implícito.4. UCAIR: un diseño de agente de búsqueda personalizado 4.1 En esta sección, presentamos un agente de búsqueda web del lado del cliente llamado UCAIR, en el que implementamos algunos de los métodos discutidos en la sección anterior para realizar una búsqueda personalizada a través del modelado de usuarios implícito. UCAIR es un complemento de navegador web que actúa como un proxy para los motores de búsqueda web. Actualmente, solo se implementa para Internet Explorer y Google, pero es una cuestión de ingeniería hacer que se ejecute en otros navegadores web e interactuar con otros motores de búsqueda. El problema de la privacidad es un obstáculo principal para implementar cualquier aplicación del mundo real que involucre modelos de usuarios serios, como la búsqueda personalizada. Por esta razón, UCAIR se ejecuta estrictamente como agente de búsqueda del lado del cliente, a diferencia de una aplicación del lado del servidor. De esta manera, la información del usuario capturada siempre reside en la computadora que el usuario está utilizando, por lo que el usuario no necesita divulgar ninguna información al exterior. La personalización del lado del cliente también permite al sistema observar fácilmente una gran cantidad de información del usuario que puede no estar fácilmente disponible para un servidor. Además, realizar una búsqueda personalizada en el lado del cliente es más escalable que en la servidor, ya que la sobrecarga de cálculo y almacenamiento se distribuye entre los clientes. Como se muestra en la Figura 1, la barra de herramientas de UCAIR tiene 3 componentes principales: (1) el módulo de modelado de usuario (implícito) captura la información de la búsqueda y el historial de los usuarios, incluidas las consultas enviadas y los resultados de búsqueda de búsqueda e infiere límites de sesión de búsqueda.(2) El módulo de modificación de la consulta mejora selectivamente la formulación de la consulta de acuerdo con el modelo de usuario actual.(3) El módulo de re-rango de resultados vuelve a clasificar inmediatamente cualquier resultado de búsqueda invisible siempre que se actualice el modelo de usuario. En UCAIR, consideramos cuatro acciones básicas del usuario: (1) enviar una consulta de palabras clave;(2) ver un documento;(3) hacer clic en el botón Atrás;(4) Haga clic en el siguiente enlace en una página de resultados. Para cada una de estas cuatro acciones, el sistema responde con, respectivamente, (1) 1 Ucair está disponible en: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Motor de búsqueda (por ejemplo, Google)Registro de historial de búsqueda (por ejemplo, consultas anteriores, resultados de consulta) Modificación de la consulta Resultado Re-raning Modelado de usuarios Buffer de resultados UCAIR Resultados de Usquery Haga clic en ...(2) actualizar la información necesita el modelo X;(3) Rerantir los resultados invisibles en la página de resultados actual basado en el modelo X actual;y (4) volver a ver las páginas invisibles y generar la siguiente página de resultados basado en el modelo actual X. Detrás de estas respuestas, hay tres tareas básicas: (1) decida si la consulta anterior está relacionada con la consulta actual y, de ser así, expandir la consulta actual con términos útiles de la consulta anterior o los resultados de la consulta anterior.(2) Actualice la información necesidad del Modelo X basado en un resumen de documentos recientemente haciendo clic.(3) Vuelva a hacer un conjunto de documentos invisibles basados en el modelo actual X. A continuación describimos nuestros algoritmos para cada uno de ellos.4.2 Detección de límites de sesión y expansión de la consulta para explotar efectivamente las consultas anteriores y su información de clic correspondiente, UCAIR debe juzgar si dos consultas adyacentes pertenecen a la misma sesión de búsqueda (es decir, detectar los límites de la sesión). El trabajo existente en la detección de límites de sesión se encuentra principalmente en el contexto del análisis de registro web (por ejemplo, [8]), y utiliza información estadística en lugar de características textuales. Dado que nuestro agente de Clientide no tiene acceso a los registros de consultas de servidor, tomamos decisiones límite de sesión basadas en la similitud textual entre dos consultas. Debido a que las consultas relacionadas no necesariamente comparten las mismas palabras (por ejemplo, isla de Java e Indonesia de viajes), no es suficiente usar solo texto de consulta. Por lo tanto, utilizamos los resultados de búsqueda de las dos consultas para ayudar a decidir si están relacionadas tópicamente. Por ejemplo, para las consultas anteriores Java Island y Travel Indonesia, las palabras Java, Bali, Island, Indonesia y viajes pueden ocurrir con frecuencia en ambas consultas, lo que produce un puntaje de alta similitud. Solo usamos los títulos y resúmenes de los resultados de búsqueda para calcular la similitud ya que están disponibles en la página de resultados de búsqueda recuperada y obtener el texto completo de cada página de resultados ralentizaría significativamente el proceso. Para compensar la parte de los títulos y resúmenes, recuperamos más resultados de los que un usuario normalmente vería con el fin de detectar límites de sesión (típicamente 50 resultados). La similitud entre la consulta anterior Q y la consulta actual Q se calcula de la siguiente manera. Sea {S1, S2 ,..., Sn} y {S1, S2 ,..., Sn} Sea el conjunto de resultados para las dos consultas. Utilizamos la fórmula de ponderación TF-IDF de normalización TF-IDF [24] para calcular un término Vector de peso SI para cada resultado SI. Definimos que el resultado promedio SAVG sea el centroide de todos los vectores de resultados, es decir, (S1 + S2 + ... + Sn)/N. La similitud cosena entre los dos resultados promedio se calcula como S AVG · Savg/ S 2 AVG · S2 AVG Si el valor de similitud excede un umbral predefinido, las dos consultas se considerarán en la misma sesión de información. Si se encuentra que la consulta anterior y la consulta actual pertenecen a la misma sesión de búsqueda, UCAIR intentaría expandir la consulta actual con los términos de la consulta anterior y sus resultados de búsqueda. Específicamente, para cada término en la consulta anterior o los resultados de búsqueda correspondientes, si su frecuencia en los resultados de la consulta actual es mayor que un umbral preestablecido (por ejemplo, 5 resultados de 50), el término se agregaría a la consulta actual aformar una consulta ampliada. En este caso, Ucair enviaría esta consulta ampliada en lugar de la original al motor de búsqueda y devolvería los resultados correspondientes a la consulta expandida. Actualmente, Ucair solo utiliza la consulta anterior inmediata para la expansión de la consulta;En principio, podríamos explotar todas las consultas pasadas relacionadas.4.3 Información Necesita la actualización del modelo Supongamos que en el momento T, hemos observado que el usuario ha visto documentos K cuyos resúmenes son S1, ..., SK. Actualizamos nuestro modelo de usuario calculando un nuevo vector de necesidad de información con un método de retroalimentación estándar en la recuperación de información (es decir, Rocchio [19]). De acuerdo con el modelo de recuperación de espacio vectorial, cada resumen de SI se puede representar por un término Vector de peso SI con cada término ponderado por una fórmula de ponderación de TF-IDF [21]. Rocchio calcula el vector centralide de todos los resúmenes y lo interpola con el vector de consulta original para obtener un vector de término actualizado. Es decir, x = αq + (1 - α) 1 k k i = 1 si donde q es el vector de consulta, k es el número de resúmenes que el usuario hace clic inmediatamente después de la consulta actual y α es un parámetro que controla la influencia de los clics deResúmenes en el modelo de necesidad de información inferida. En nuestros experimentos, α se establece en 0.5. Tenga en cuenta que actualizamos el modelo de necesidad de información siempre que el usuario ve un documento.4.4 Resultados Reranking En general, queremos volver a ser todos los resultados invisibles tan pronto como se actualice el modelo de usuario. Actualmente, UCAIR implementa la rescisión en dos casos, correspondiente al usuario haciendo clic en el botón Atrás y el siguiente enlace en el Explorador de Internet. En ambos casos, el modelo de usuario actual (actualizado) se utilizaría para volver a revisar los resultados invisibles para que el usuario vea mejores resultados de búsqueda de inmediato. Para volver a revisar los resúmenes de documentos invisibles, UCAIR utiliza el modelo de recuperación de espacio vectorial estándar y obtiene cada resumen en función de la similitud del resultado y la información actual del usuario necesita el vector X [21]. Dado que la retroalimentación implícita no es completamente confiable, mencionamos solo un pequeño número (por ejemplo, 5) de los resultados mejorados más altos para ser seguidos por cualquier resultado originalmente de alto rango.828 Resultado de Google (consulta de usuario = mapa Java) Resultado de Ucair (consulta de usuario = mapa java) consulta anterior = viajar indonesia consulta anterior = hashtable expandido de usuario consulta = mapa java indonesia consulta de usuario expandida = mapa java clase 1 proyecciones de mapa de java del mundo...

Tabla 1: Resultados de muestra de la expansión de la consulta 5. Evaluación de UCAIR Ahora presentamos algunos resultados sobre la evaluación de las dos funciones principales de UCAIR: expansión de consultas selectivas y resultados de resultados basados en datos de clics del usuario.5.1 Resultados de la muestra La estrategia de expansión de consulta implementada en UCAIR es intencionalmente conservadora para evitar la interpretación errónea de los modelos de usuario implícitos. En la práctica, cada vez que elige expandir la consulta, la expansión generalmente tiene sentido. En la Tabla 1, mostramos cómo UCAIR puede distinguir con éxito dos contextos de búsqueda diferentes para el mapa Java de consulta, correspondiente a dos consultas anteriores diferentes (es decir, Travel Indonesia vs. Hashtable). Debido al modelado implícito de usuarios, Ucair se resuelve inteligentemente para agregar Indonesia y clase, respectivamente, al mapa de Java de consulta de los usuarios, que de otro modo sería ambiguo como se muestra en los resultados originales de Google el 21 de marzo de 2005. Los resultados de Ucairs son mucho más precisos que los resultados de Googles y reflejan la personalización en la búsqueda. El ansioso componente de retroalimentación implícita está diseñado para responder inmediatamente a la actividad de los usuarios, como ver un documento. En la Figura 2, mostramos cómo Ucair puede desambiguar con éxito una consulta ambigua Jaguar explotando un resumen de documentos visto. En este caso, los resultados iniciales de recuperación utilizando Jaguar (que se muestra en el lado izquierdo) contienen dos resultados sobre los autos Jaguar seguidos de dos resultados sobre el software Jaguar. Sin embargo, después de que el usuario ve el contenido de la página web del segundo resultado (sobre el automóvil Jaguar) y vuelve a la página de resultados de búsqueda haciendo clic en el botón Atrás, UCAIR nomina automáticamente dos nuevos resultados de búsqueda sobre los automóviles Jaguar (que se muestran en el lado derecho), mientras queLos dos resultados originales sobre el software Jaguar se empujan hacia abajo en la lista (sin ser visto de la imagen).5.2 Evaluación cuantitativa Para evaluar más a fondo cuantitativamente, realizamos un estudio de usuario sobre la efectividad del ansioso componente de retroalimentación implícita. Es un desafío evaluar cuantitativamente la mejora potencial del rendimiento de nuestro modelo propuesto y UCAIR sobre Google de una manera imparcial [7]. Aquí, diseñamos un estudio de usuarios, en el que los participantes realizarían una búsqueda web normal y juzgarían un conjunto de resultados mixto aleatorio y anónimo de Google y Ucair al final de la sesión de búsqueda;Los participantes no saben si un resultado proviene de Google o Ucair. Reclutamos 6 estudiantes de posgrado para este estudio de usuarios, que tienen diferentes antecedentes (3 informática, 2 biología y 1 chem <pot> <um> Número: 716 <title> spammer arrestado demanda <descremisión> Descripción: se han arrestado a los spammerso demandado por enviar correos electrónicos no solicitados? <Narr> Narrativa: los casos de arrestos, enjuiciamientos, condenas y castigos de spammers y demandas contra ellos son relevantes. Los documentos que describen las leyes para limitar el spam sin dar detalles de demandas o juicios penales no son relevantes.</pop> Figura 3: Un ejemplo de tema de consulta de TREC, expresado en una forma que podría entregarse a un asistente humano o bibliotecario). Utilizamos temas de consulta de TREC 2 2004 Terabyte Track [2] y TREC 2003 Web Track [4] Tarea de destilación de temas en la forma que se describirá a continuación. Un tema de ejemplo de Trec 2004 Terabyte Track aparece en la Figura 3. El título es una frase corta y puede usarse como una consulta para el sistema de recuperación. El campo de descripción proporciona una declaración ligeramente más larga del requisito del tema, generalmente expresado como una sola oración o pregunta completa. Finalmente, la narrativa proporciona información adicional necesaria para especificar completamente el requisito, expresado en forma de un párrafo corto. Inicialmente, cada participante exploraría 50 temas de Terabyte Track o Web Track y elegiría 5 o 7 temas más interesantes. Para cada tema seleccionado, el participante hará esencialmente la búsqueda web normal utilizando UCAIR para encontrar muchas páginas web relevantes utilizando el título del tema de consulta como la consulta de palabras clave inicial. Durante este proceso, el participante puede ver los resultados de búsqueda y posiblemente hacer clic en algunos interesantes para ver las páginas web, al igual que en una búsqueda web normal. No hay requisito ni restricción sobre cuántas consultas debe enviar el participante o cuándo el participante debe detener la búsqueda de un tema. Cuando el participante planea cambiar el tema de búsqueda, él/ella simplemente presionará una conferencia de recuperación de texto del botón 2: http://trec.nist.gov/ 829 Figura 2: capturas de pantalla para que el resultado vuelva a evaluar los resultados de búsqueda antes de cambiar realmenteal siguiente tema. En el momento de la evaluación, 30 resultados clasificados de Google y UCAIR (algunos se superponen) se mezclan aleatoriamente para que el participante no sepa si un resultado proviene de Google o UCAIR. El participante juzgaría la relevancia de estos resultados. Medimos la precisión en los documentos TOP N (N = 5, 10, 20, 30) de Google y Ucair. También evaluamos las precisiones en diferentes niveles de retiro. En total, 368 documentos juzgados como relevantes de los resultados de búsqueda de Google y 429 documentos juzgados como relevantes de UCAIR por los participantes. Los gráficos de dispersión de precisión en los 10 documentos top 10 y principales se muestran en la Figura 4 y la Figura 5 respectivamente (el gráfico de dispersión de precisión en los 30 documentos principales es muy similar a la precisión en los 20 documentos principales). Cada punto de los gráficos de dispersión representa las precisiones de Google y Ucair en un tema de consulta. La Tabla 2 muestra la precisión promedio en los documentos Top N entre 32 temas. De la Figura 4, Figura 5 y Tabla 2, vemos que los resultados de búsqueda de UCAIR son consistentemente mejores que los de Google por todas las medidas. Además, la mejora del rendimiento es más dramática para la precisión en los 20 documentos principales que en la precisión en los 10 documentos principales. Una explicación para esto es que cuanta más interacción tenga el usuario con el sistema, más datos de clics se puede esperar que recopile UCAIR. Por lo tanto, el sistema de recuperación puede construir modelos de usuario implícitos más precisos, lo que conduce a una mejor precisión de recuperación.

Conclusiones En este documento, estudiamos cómo explotar el modelado implícito de los usuarios para personalizar de manera inteligente la recuperación de información y mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda. A diferencia de la mayoría de los trabajos anteriores, enfatizamos el uso del contexto de búsqueda inmediata y la información de retroalimentación implícita, así como la actualización ansiosa de los resultados de búsqueda para beneficiar al máximo a un usuario. Presentamos un marco teórico de decisión para optimizar la recuperación de información interactiva basada en una actualización de modelo de usuario ansiosa, en el que el sistema responde a cada acción del usuario eligiendo una acción del sistema para optimizar una función de utilidad. Además, proponemos técnicas específicas para capturar y explotar dos tipos de información de retroalimentación implícita: (1) Identificar la consulta inmediatamente precedente relacionada y usar la consulta y los resultados de búsqueda correspondientes para seleccionar los términos apropiados para expandir la consulta actual, y (2) explotar la vista vistaDocumente resúmenes para volver a revisar inmediatamente cualquier documento que el usuario aún no haya visto. Usando estas técnicas, desarrollamos un agente de búsqueda web del lado del cliente (UCAIR) además de un motor de búsqueda popular (Google). Los experimentos en la búsqueda web muestran que nuestro agente de búsqueda puede mejorar la precisión de la búsqueda en más de 830 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.5 0.7 0.7 0.9 1 1 Ucair prec@20 GooglePREC@20 Disperso de precisión en los 20 documentos Top Figura 5: Precisión: Precisión: Precisión 5En los 20 documentos principales de UCAIR y Google 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.6 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 Recuerda Precisión Precisión - Recuerda Curvas de Google Resultado de UCAIR Figura 6: Precisión a 20 Resultados de UCAIR de UCAIR de UCAIy Google Google.

Por lo tanto, el agente de búsqueda desarrollado puede mejorar el rendimiento de búsqueda web existente sin ningún esfuerzo adicional del usuario.7.

        "Implicit User Modeling for Personalized Search Xuehua Shen, Bin Tan, ChengXiang Zhai Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign ABSTRACT Information retrieval systems (e.g., web search engines) are critical for overcoming information overload.",
        "A major deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user modeling and are not adaptive to individual users, resulting in inherently non-optimal retrieval performance.",
        "For example, a tourist and a programmer may use the same word java to search for different information, but the current search systems would return the same results.",
        "In this paper, we study how to infer a users interest from the users search context and use the inferred implicit user model for personalized search .",
        "We present a decision theoretic framework and develop techniques for implicit user modeling in information retrieval.",
        "We develop an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that can perform eager implicit feedback, e.g., query expansion based on previous queries and immediate result reranking based on clickthrough information.",
        "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over the popular Google search engine.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Retrieval models, Relevance feedback, Search Process General Terms Algorithms 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION Although many information retrieval systems (e.g., web search engines and digital library systems) have been successfully deployed, the current retrieval systems are far from optimal.",
        "A major deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user modeling and are not adaptive to individual users [17].",
        "This inherent non-optimality is seen clearly in the following two cases: (1) Different users may use exactly the same query (e.g., Java) to search for different information (e.g., the Java island in Indonesia or the Java programming language), but existing IR systems return the same results for these users.",
        "Without considering the actual user, it is impossible to know which sense Java refers to in a query. (2) A users information needs may change over time.",
        "The same user may use Java sometimes to mean the Java island in Indonesia and some other times to mean the programming language.",
        "Without recognizing the search context, it would be again impossible to recognize the correct sense.",
        "In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model the user appropriately and personalize search according to each individual user.",
        "The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a users information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task.",
        "Indeed, it is even hard for a user to precisely describe what his/her information need is.",
        "What information is available for a system to infer a users information need?",
        "Obviously, the users query provides the most direct evidence.",
        "Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on the query to model a users information need.",
        "However, since a query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished .",
        "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",
        "This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20].",
        "Unfortunately, in real world applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to provide relevant examples for feedback [11].",
        "It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.",
        "Indeed, several previous studies have shown that implicit user modeling can improve retrieval accuracy.",
        "In [3], a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a users explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time, mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback).",
        "It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.",
        "In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking of search results that suits a group of users preferences.",
        "In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information.",
        "For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information.",
        "In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.",
        "Consider the query Java again.",
        "Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",
        "In this paper, we study how to construct and update a user model based on the immediate search context and implicit feedback information and use the model to improve the accuracy of ad-hoc retrieval.",
        "In order to maximally benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling, we propose to perform eager implicit feedback.",
        "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model.",
        "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
        "In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values.",
        "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
        "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
        "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
        "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
        "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
        "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
        "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
        "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
        "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
        "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling.",
        "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback.",
        "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
        "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
        "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
        "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
        "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
        "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
        "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
        "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
        "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
        "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
        "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
        "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
        "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
        "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
        "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
        "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
        "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
        "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
        "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
        "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
        "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
        "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
        "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
        "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
        "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
        "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
        "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
        "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
        "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
        "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
        "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
        "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
        "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
        "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
        "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
        "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
        "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
        "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
        "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
        "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
        "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
        "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
        "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
        "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
        "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
        "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
        "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
        "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
        "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
        "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
        "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
        "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
        "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
        "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
        "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
        "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
        "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
        "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
        "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
        "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
        "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
        "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
        "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
        "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
        "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
        "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
        "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
        "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
        "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
        "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
        "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
        "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
        "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
        "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
        "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
        "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
        "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
        "We now discuss a few of them.",
        "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
        "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
        "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
        "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
        "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
        "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
        "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
        "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
        "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
        "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
        "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
        "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
        "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
        "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
        "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
        "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
        "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
        "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
        "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
        "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
        "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
        "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
        "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
        "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
        "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
        "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
        "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
        "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
        "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
        "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
        "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
        "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
        "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
        "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
        "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
        "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
        "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
        "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
        "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
        "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
        "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
        "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",
        "That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.",
        "In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.",
        "Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.",
        "Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.",
        "In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.",
        "To rerank any unseen document summaries, UCAIR uses the standard vector space retrieval model and scores each summary based on the similarity of the result and the current user information need vector x [21].",
        "Since implicit feedback is not completely reliable, we bring up only a small number (e.g. 5) of highest reranked results to be followed by any originally high ranked results. 828 Google result (user query = java map) UCAIR result (user query =java map) previous query = travel Indonesia previous query = hashtable expanded user query = java map Indonesia expanded user query = java map class 1 Java map projections of the world ...

        "EVALUATION OF UCAIR We now present some results on evaluating the two major UCAIR functions: selective query expansion and result reranking based on user clickthrough data. 5.1 Sample results The query expansion strategy implemented in UCAIR is intentionally conservative to avoid misinterpretation of implicit user models.",
        "In practice, whenever it chooses to expand the query, the expansion usually makes sense.",
        "In Table 1, we show how UCAIR can successfully distinguish two different search contexts for the query java map, corresponding to two different previous queries (i.e., travel Indonesia vs. hashtable).",
        "Due to implicit user modeling, UCAIR intelligently figures out to add Indonesia and class, respectively, to the users query java map, which would otherwise be ambiguous as shown in the original results from Google on March 21, 2005.",
        "UCAIRs results are much more accurate than Googles results and reflect personalization in search.",
        "The eager implicit feedback component is designed to immediately respond to a users activity such as viewing a document.",
        "In Figure 2, we show how UCAIR can successfully disambiguate an ambiguous query jaguar by exploiting a viewed document summary.",
        "In this case, the initial retrieval results using jaguar (shown on the left side) contain two results about the Jaguar cars followed by two results about the Jaguar software.",
        "However, after the user views the web page content of the second result (about Jaguar car) and returns to the search result page by clicking Back button, UCAIR automatically nominates two new search results about Jaguar cars (shown on the right side), while the original two results about Jaguar software are pushed down on the list (unseen from the picture). 5.2 Quantitative evaluation To further evaluate UCAIR quantitatively, we conduct a user study on the effectiveness of the eager implicit feedback component.",
        "It is a challenge to quantitatively evaluate the potential performance improvement of our proposed model and UCAIR over Google in an unbiased way [7].",
        "Here, we design a user study, in which participants would do normal web search and judge a randomly and anonymously mixed set of results from Google and UCAIR at the end of the search session; participants do not know whether a result comes from Google or UCAIR.",

        "An example topic from TREC 2004 Terabyte track appears in Figure 3.",
        "The title is a short phrase and may be used as a query to the retrieval system.",
        "The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question.",
        "Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph.",
        "Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics.",
        "For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.",
        "During this process, the participant may view the search results and possibly click on some interesting ones to view the web pages, just as in a normal web search.",
        "There is no requirement or restriction on how many queries the participant must submit or when the participant should stop the search for one topic.",
        "When the participant plans to change the search topic, he/she will simply press a button 2 Text REtrieval Conference: http://trec.nist.gov/ 829 Figure 2: Screen shots for result reranking to evaluate the search results before actually switching to the next topic.",
        "At the time of evaluation, 30 top ranked results from Google and UCAIR (some are overlapping) are randomly mixed together so that the participant would not know whether a result comes from Google or UCAIR.",
        "The participant would then judge the relevance of these results.",
        "We measure precision at top n (n = 5, 10, 20, 30) documents of Google and UCAIR.",
        "We also evaluate precisions at different recall levels.",
        "Altogether, 368 documents judged as relevant from Google search results and 429 documents judged as relevant from UCAIR by participants.",
        "Scatter plots of precision at top 10 and top 20 documents are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5 respectively (The scatter plot of precision at top 30 documents is very similar to precision at top 20 documents).",
        "Each point of the scatter plots represents the precisions of Google and UCAIR on one query topic.",
        "Table 2 shows the average precision at top n documents among 32 topics.",
        "From Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table 2, we see that the search results from UCAIR are consistently better than those from Google by all the measures.",
        "Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents.",
        "One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect.",
        "Thus the retrieval system can build more precise implicit user models, which lead to better retrieval accuracy.",

        "CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we studied how to exploit implicit user modeling to intelligently personalize information retrieval and improve search accuracy.",
        "Unlike most previous work, we emphasize the use of immediate search context and implicit feedback information as well as eager updating of search results to maximally benefit a user.",
        "We presented a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
        "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
        "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent (UCAIR) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
        "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over 830 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 UCAIR prec@20 Googleprec@20 Scatterplot of Precision at Top 20 documents Figure 5: Precision at top 20 documents of UCAIR and Google 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 recall precision Precision−Recall curves Google Result UCAIR Result Figure 6: Precision at top 20 result of UCAIR and Google Google.",
        "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",

                "A major deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user modeling and are not adaptive to individual users [17].",
                "This inherent non-optimality is seen clearly in the following two cases: (1) Different users may use exactly the same query (e.g., Java) to search for different information (e.g., the Java island in Indonesia or the Java programming language), but existing IR systems return the same results for these users.",
                "Without considering the actual user, it is impossible to know which sense Java refers to in a query. (2) A users information needs may change over time.",
                "The same user may use Java sometimes to mean the Java island in Indonesia and some other times to mean the programming language.",
                "Without recognizing the search context, it would be again impossible to recognize the correct sense.",
                "In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model the user appropriately and personalize search according to each individual user.",
                "The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a users information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task.",
                "Indeed, it is even hard for a user to precisely describe what his/her information need is.",
                "What information is available for a system to infer a users information need?",
                "Obviously, the users query provides the most direct evidence.",
                "Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on the query to model a users information need.",
                "However, since a query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished .",
                "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",
                "This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20].",
                "Unfortunately, in real world applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to provide relevant examples for feedback [11].",
                "It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.",
                "Indeed, several previous studies have shown that implicit user modeling can improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "In [3], a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a users explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time, mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback).",
                "It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.",
                "In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking of search results that suits a group of users preferences.",
                "In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information.",
                "For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information.",
                "In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.",
                "Consider the query Java again.",
                "Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",

                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
                "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling.",
                "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback.",
                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
                "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",
                "That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.",
                "In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.",
                "Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.",
                "In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.",

                "In Table 1, we show how UCAIR can successfully distinguish two different search contexts for the query java map, corresponding to two different previous queries (i.e., travel Indonesia vs. hashtable).",

                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",
                "In this paper, we study how to construct and update a user model based on the immediate search context and implicit feedback information and use the model to improve the accuracy of ad-hoc retrieval.",
                "In order to maximally benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling, we propose to perform eager implicit feedback.",
                "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model.",
                "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
                "In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values.",
                "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (<br>user-centered adaptive information retrieval</br>) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
                "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling.",
                "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback.",
                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
                "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",

                "In Table 1, we show how UCAIR can successfully distinguish two different search contexts for the query java map, corresponding to two different previous queries (i.e., travel Indonesia vs. hashtable).",
                "Due to implicit user modeling, UCAIR intelligently figures out to add Indonesia and class, respectively, to the users query java map, which would otherwise be ambiguous as shown in the original results from Google on March 21, 2005.",

                "The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question.",
                "Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph.",
                "Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics.",
                "For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.",
                "During this process, the participant may view the search results and possibly click on some interesting ones to view the web pages, just as in a normal web search.",
                "There is no requirement or restriction on how many queries the participant must submit or when the participant should stop the search for one topic.",

                "Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents.",
                "One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect.",

                "For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information.",
                "In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.",
                "Consider the query Java again.",
                "Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",
                "In this paper, we study how to construct and update a user model based on the immediate search context and implicit feedback information and use the model to improve the accuracy of ad-hoc retrieval.",
                "In order to maximally benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling, we propose to perform eager implicit feedback.",
                "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model.",
                "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
                "In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values.",
                "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
                "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling.",
                "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback.",
                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a <br>personalized web search</br> agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google <br>personalized web search</br> [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",

                "The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question.",
                "Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph.",
                "Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics.",
                "For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.",
                "During this process, the participant may view the search results and possibly click on some interesting ones to view the web pages, just as in a normal web search.",
                "There is no requirement or restriction on how many queries the participant must submit or when the participant should stop the search for one topic.",

                "Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents.",
                "One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect.",

                "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",
                "This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20].",

                "It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.",

                "It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.",

(2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",

(2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",

                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",

                "OPTIMIZATION IN <br>interactive ir</br> In <br>interactive ir</br>, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",

                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",

                "In Table 1, we show how UCAIR can successfully distinguish two different search contexts for the query java map, corresponding to two different previous queries (i.e., travel Indonesia vs. hashtable).",
                "Due to implicit user modeling, UCAIR intelligently figures out to add Indonesia and class, respectively, to the users query java map, which would otherwise be ambiguous as shown in the original results from Google on March 21, 2005.",

                "However, after the user views the web page content of the second result (about Jaguar car) and returns to the search result page by clicking Back button, UCAIR automatically nominates two new search results about Jaguar cars (shown on the right side), while the original two results about Jaguar software are pushed down on the list (unseen from the picture). 5.2 Quantitative evaluation To further evaluate UCAIR quantitatively, we conduct a user study on the effectiveness of the eager implicit feedback component.",

                "The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question.",
                "Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph.",
                "Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics.",
                "For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.",
                "During this process, the participant may view the search results and possibly click on some interesting ones to view the web pages, just as in a normal web search.",

                "From Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table 2, we see that the search results from UCAIR are consistently better than those from Google by all the measures.",
                "Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents.",
                "One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect.",

                "This inherent non-optimality is seen clearly in the following two cases: (1) Different users may use exactly the same query (e.g., Java) to search for different information (e.g., the Java island in Indonesia or the Java programming language), but existing IR systems return the same results for these users.",
                "Without considering the actual user, it is impossible to know which sense Java refers to in a query. (2) A users information needs may change over time.",
                "The same user may use Java sometimes to mean the Java island in Indonesia and some other times to mean the programming language.",
                "Without recognizing the search context, it would be again impossible to recognize the correct sense.",
                "In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model the user appropriately and personalize search according to each individual user.",
                "The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a users information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task.",
                "Indeed, it is even hard for a user to precisely describe what his/her information need is.",
                "What information is available for a system to infer a users information need?",
                "Obviously, the users query provides the most direct evidence.",
                "Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on the query to model a users information need.",
                "However, since a query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished .",
                "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",
                "This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20].",
                "Unfortunately, in real world applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to provide relevant examples for feedback [11].",
                "It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.",
                "Indeed, several previous studies have shown that implicit user modeling can improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "In [3], a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a users explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time, mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback).",
                "It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.",
                "In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking of search results that suits a group of users preferences.",
                "In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information.",
                "For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information.",
                "In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.",
                "Consider the query Java again.",
                "Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",
                "In this paper, we study how to construct and update a user model based on the immediate search context and implicit feedback information and use the model to improve the accuracy of ad-hoc retrieval.",
                "In order to maximally benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling, we propose to perform eager implicit feedback.",
                "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model.",
                "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
                "In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values.",
                "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
                "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling.",
                "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback.",
                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize <br>retrieval performance</br> by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing <br>retrieval performance</br> through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
                "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",
                "That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.",
                "In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.",
                "Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.",
                "In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.",
                "To rerank any unseen document summaries, UCAIR uses the standard vector space retrieval model and scores each summary based on the similarity of the result and the current user information need vector x [21].",
                "Since implicit feedback is not completely reliable, we bring up only a small number (e.g. 5) of highest reranked results to be followed by any originally high ranked results. 828 Google result (user query = java map) UCAIR result (user query =java map) previous query = travel Indonesia previous query = hashtable expanded user query = java map Indonesia expanded user query = java map class 1 Java map projections of the world ...

                "EVALUATION OF UCAIR We now present some results on evaluating the two major UCAIR functions: selective query expansion and result reranking based on user clickthrough data. 5.1 Sample results The query expansion strategy implemented in UCAIR is intentionally conservative to avoid misinterpretation of implicit user models.",

                "In Table 1, we show how UCAIR can successfully distinguish two different search contexts for the query java map, corresponding to two different previous queries (i.e., travel Indonesia vs. hashtable).",
                "Due to implicit user modeling, UCAIR intelligently figures out to add Indonesia and class, respectively, to the users query java map, which would otherwise be ambiguous as shown in the original results from Google on March 21, 2005.",
                "UCAIRs results are much more accurate than Googles results and reflect personalization in search.",

                "In this case, the initial retrieval results using jaguar (shown on the left side) contain two results about the Jaguar cars followed by two results about the Jaguar software.",
                "However, after the user views the web page content of the second result (about Jaguar car) and returns to the search result page by clicking Back button, UCAIR automatically nominates two new search results about Jaguar cars (shown on the right side), while the original two results about Jaguar software are pushed down on the list (unseen from the picture). 5.2 Quantitative evaluation To further evaluate UCAIR quantitatively, we conduct a user study on the effectiveness of the eager implicit feedback component.",

                "The title is a short phrase and may be used as a query to the retrieval system.",
                "The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question.",
                "Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph.",
                "Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics.",
                "For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.",
                "During this process, the participant may view the search results and possibly click on some interesting ones to view the web pages, just as in a normal web search.",
                "There is no requirement or restriction on how many queries the participant must submit or when the participant should stop the search for one topic.",

                "From Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table 2, we see that the search results from UCAIR are consistently better than those from Google by all the measures.",
                "Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents.",
                "One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect.",

                "A major deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user modeling and are not adaptive to individual users, resulting in inherently non-optimal retrieval performance.",

                "INTRODUCTION Although many information retrieval systems (e.g., web search engines and digital library systems) have been successfully deployed, the current retrieval systems are far from optimal.",
                "A major deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user modeling and are not adaptive to individual users [17].",
                "This inherent non-optimality is seen clearly in the following two cases: (1) Different users may use exactly the same query (e.g., Java) to search for different information (e.g., the Java island in Indonesia or the Java programming language), but existing IR systems return the same results for these users.",
                "Without considering the actual user, it is impossible to know which sense Java refers to in a query. (2) A users information needs may change over time.",
                "The same user may use Java sometimes to mean the Java island in Indonesia and some other times to mean the programming language.",
                "Without recognizing the search context, it would be again impossible to recognize the correct sense.",
                "In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model the user appropriately and personalize search according to each individual user.",
                "The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a users information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task.",
                "Indeed, it is even hard for a user to precisely describe what his/her information need is.",
                "What information is available for a system to infer a users information need?",
                "Obviously, the users query provides the most direct evidence.",
                "Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on the query to model a users information need.",
                "However, since a query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished .",
                "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",
                "This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20].",
                "Unfortunately, in real world applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to provide relevant examples for feedback [11].",
                "It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.",
                "Indeed, several previous studies have shown that implicit user modeling can improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "In [3], a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a users explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time, mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback).",
                "It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.",
                "In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking of search results that suits a group of users preferences.",
                "In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information.",
                "For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information.",
                "In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.",
                "Consider the query Java again.",
                "Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",
                "In this paper, we study how to construct and update a user model based on the immediate search context and implicit feedback information and use the model to improve the accuracy of ad-hoc retrieval.",
                "In order to maximally benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling, we propose to perform eager implicit feedback.",
                "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model.",
                "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
                "In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values.",
                "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
                "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling.",
                "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback.",
                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for <br>query refinement</br>.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different <br>query refinement</br> strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",

                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
                "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",
                "That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.",
                "In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.",
                "Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.",
                "In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.",
                "To rerank any unseen document summaries, UCAIR uses the standard vector space retrieval model and scores each summary based on the similarity of the result and the current user information need vector x [21].",
                "Since implicit feedback is not completely reliable, we bring up only a small number (e.g. 5) of highest reranked results to be followed by any originally high ranked results. 828 Google result (user query = java map) UCAIR result (user query =java map) previous query = travel Indonesia previous query = hashtable expanded user query = java map Indonesia expanded user query = java map class 1 Java map projections of the world ...

                "In Table 1, we show how UCAIR can successfully distinguish two different search contexts for the query java map, corresponding to two different previous queries (i.e., travel Indonesia vs. hashtable).",
                "Due to implicit user modeling, UCAIR intelligently figures out to add Indonesia and class, respectively, to the users query java map, which would otherwise be ambiguous as shown in the original results from Google on March 21, 2005.",
                "UCAIRs results are much more accurate than Googles results and reflect personalization in search.",
                "The eager implicit feedback component is designed to immediately respond to a users activity such as viewing a document.",

                "In this case, the initial retrieval results using jaguar (shown on the left side) contain two results about the Jaguar cars followed by two results about the Jaguar software.",
                "However, after the user views the web page content of the second result (about Jaguar car) and returns to the search result page by clicking Back button, UCAIR automatically nominates two new search results about Jaguar cars (shown on the right side), while the original two results about Jaguar software are pushed down on the list (unseen from the picture). 5.2 Quantitative evaluation To further evaluate UCAIR quantitatively, we conduct a user study on the effectiveness of the eager implicit feedback component.",
                "It is a challenge to quantitatively evaluate the potential performance improvement of our proposed model and UCAIR over Google in an unbiased way [7].",
                "Here, we design a user study, in which participants would do normal web search and judge a randomly and anonymously mixed set of results from Google and UCAIR at the end of the search session; participants do not know whether a result comes from Google or UCAIR.",

                "The title is a short phrase and may be used as a query to the retrieval system.",
                "The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question.",
                "Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph.",
                "Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics.",
                "For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.",
                "During this process, the participant may view the search results and possibly click on some interesting ones to view the web pages, just as in a normal web search.",
                "There is no requirement or restriction on how many queries the participant must submit or when the participant should stop the search for one topic.",

                "Table 2 shows the average precision at top n documents among 32 topics.",
                "From Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table 2, we see that the search results from UCAIR are consistently better than those from Google by all the measures.",
                "Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents.",
                "One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect.",

                "This inherent non-optimality is seen clearly in the following two cases: (1) Different users may use exactly the same query (e.g., Java) to search for different information (e.g., the Java island in Indonesia or the Java programming language), but existing IR systems return the same results for these users.",
                "Without considering the actual user, it is impossible to know which sense Java refers to in a query. (2) A users information needs may change over time.",

                "Without recognizing the search context, it would be again impossible to recognize the correct sense.",
                "In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model the user appropriately and personalize search according to each individual user.",
                "The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a users information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task.",
                "Indeed, it is even hard for a user to precisely describe what his/her information need is.",
                "What information is available for a system to infer a users information need?",
                "Obviously, the users query provides the most direct evidence.",
                "Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on the query to model a users information need.",
                "However, since a query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished .",
                "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",
                "This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20].",
                "Unfortunately, in real world applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to provide relevant examples for feedback [11].",
                "It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.",
                "Indeed, several previous studies have shown that <br>implicit user modeling</br> can improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "In [3], a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a users explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time, mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback).",
                "It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.",
                "In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking of search results that suits a group of users preferences.",
                "In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information.",
                "For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information.",
                "In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.",
                "Consider the query Java again.",
                "Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",
                "In this paper, we study how to construct and update a user model based on the immediate search context and implicit feedback information and use the model to improve the accuracy of ad-hoc retrieval.",
                "In order to maximally benefit the user of a retrieval system through <br>implicit user modeling</br>, we propose to perform eager implicit feedback.",
                "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model.",
                "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
                "In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values.",
                "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
                "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for <br>implicit user modeling</br>.",
                "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback.",
                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK <br>implicit user modeling</br> for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of <br>implicit user modeling</br> as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through <br>implicit user modeling</br> without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through <br>implicit user modeling</br> in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 <br>implicit user modeling</br> <br>implicit user modeling</br> is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for <br>implicit user modeling</br>.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",

                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",

                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through <br>implicit user modeling</br>.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",

                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
                "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",
                "That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.",
                "In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.",
                "Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.",
                "In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.",
                "To rerank any unseen document summaries, UCAIR uses the standard vector space retrieval model and scores each summary based on the similarity of the result and the current user information need vector x [21].",
                "Since implicit feedback is not completely reliable, we bring up only a small number (e.g. 5) of highest reranked results to be followed by any originally high ranked results. 828 Google result (user query = java map) UCAIR result (user query =java map) previous query = travel Indonesia previous query = hashtable expanded user query = java map Indonesia expanded user query = java map class 1 Java map projections of the world ...

                "The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question.",
                "Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph.",
                "Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics.",
                "For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.",
                "During this process, the participant may view the search results and possibly click on some interesting ones to view the web pages, just as in a normal web search.",

                "Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents.",
                "One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect.",

                "This inherent non-optimality is seen clearly in the following two cases: (1) Different users may use exactly the same query (e.g., Java) to search for different information (e.g., the Java island in Indonesia or the Java programming language), but existing IR systems return the same results for these users.",
                "Without considering the actual user, it is impossible to know which sense Java refers to in a query. (2) A users information needs may change over time.",

                "Without recognizing the search context, it would be again impossible to recognize the correct sense.",
                "In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model the user appropriately and personalize search according to each individual user.",
                "The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a users information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task.",
                "Indeed, it is even hard for a user to precisely describe what his/her information need is.",
                "What information is available for a system to infer a users information need?",
                "Obviously, the users query provides the most direct evidence.",
                "Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on the query to model a users information need.",
                "However, since a query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished .",
                "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",
                "This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20].",
                "Unfortunately, in real world applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to provide relevant examples for feedback [11].",
                "It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.",

                "In [3], a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a users explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time, mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback).",
                "It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.",
                "In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking of search results that suits a group of users preferences.",
                "In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through <br>query expansion</br> to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information.",
                "For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information.",
                "In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.",
                "Consider the query Java again.",
                "Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",

                "In order to maximally benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling, we propose to perform eager implicit feedback.",
                "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model.",
                "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
                "In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values.",
                "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",

                "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback.",
                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform <br>query expansion</br>.",
                "Our <br>query expansion</br> approach is similar to automatic <br>query expansion</br> [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing <br>query expansion</br> as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and <br>query expansion</br> To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for <br>query expansion</br>; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
                "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",
                "That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.",
                "In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.",
                "Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.",
                "In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.",
                "To rerank any unseen document summaries, UCAIR uses the standard vector space retrieval model and scores each summary based on the similarity of the result and the current user information need vector x [21].",
                "Since implicit feedback is not completely reliable, we bring up only a small number (e.g. 5) of highest reranked results to be followed by any originally high ranked results. 828 Google result (user query = java map) UCAIR result (user query =java map) previous query = travel Indonesia previous query = hashtable expanded user query = java map Indonesia expanded user query = java map class 1 Java map projections of the world ...

                "The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question.",
                "Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph.",
                "Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics.",
                "For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.",

                "Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents.",
                "One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect.",

                "Without recognizing the search context, it would be again impossible to recognize the correct sense.",

                "The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a users information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task.",
                "Indeed, it is even hard for a user to precisely describe what his/her information need is.",
                "What information is available for a system to infer a users information need?",
                "Obviously, the users query provides the most direct evidence.",
                "Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on the query to model a users information need.",
                "However, since a query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished .",
                "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",
                "This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20].",
                "Unfortunately, in real world applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to provide relevant examples for feedback [11].",
                "It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.",

                "In [3], a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a users explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time, mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback).",
                "It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.",
                "In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking of search results that suits a group of users preferences.",
                "In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information.",
                "For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information.",
                "In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.",
                "Consider the query Java again.",
                "Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",
                "In this paper, we study how to construct and update a user model based on the immediate search context and implicit feedback information and use the model to improve the accuracy of ad-hoc retrieval.",
                "In order to maximally benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling, we propose to perform eager implicit feedback.",
                "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model.",
                "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
                "In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values.",
                "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",

                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
                "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",
                "That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.",
                "In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.",
                "Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.",
                "In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.",
                "To rerank any unseen document summaries, UCAIR uses the standard vector space retrieval model and scores each summary based on the similarity of the result and the current user information need vector x [21].",
                "Since implicit feedback is not completely reliable, we bring up only a small number (e.g. 5) of highest reranked results to be followed by any originally high ranked results. 828 Google result (user query = java map) UCAIR result (user query =java map) previous query = travel Indonesia previous query = hashtable expanded user query = java map Indonesia expanded user query = java map class 1 Java map projections of the world ...

                "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",

                "In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information.",

                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
                "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling.",
                "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback.",
                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
                "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",
                "That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.",
                "In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.",
                "Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.",
                "In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.",

                "In Table 1, we show how UCAIR can successfully distinguish two different search contexts for the query java map, corresponding to two different previous queries (i.e., travel Indonesia vs. hashtable).",

                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",
                "In this paper, we study how to construct and update a user model based on the immediate search context and <br>implicit feedback</br> information and use the model to improve the accuracy of ad-hoc retrieval.",
                "In order to maximally benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling, we propose to perform eager <br>implicit feedback</br>.",
                "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model.",
                "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
                "In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values.",
                "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of <br>implicit feedback</br> information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
                "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling.",
                "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager <br>implicit feedback</br>.",
                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of <br>implicit feedback</br> information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new <br>implicit feedback</br> information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users <br>implicit feedback</br> information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from <br>implicit feedback</br>.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",

                "The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question.",
                "Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph.",
                "Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics.",
                "For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.",
                "During this process, the participant may view the search results and possibly click on some interesting ones to view the web pages, just as in a normal web search.",

                "Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents.",
                "One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect.",

                "This inherent non-optimality is seen clearly in the following two cases: (1) Different users may use exactly the same query (e.g., Java) to search for different information (e.g., the Java island in Indonesia or the Java programming language), but existing IR systems return the same results for these users.",

                "The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a users information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task.",
                "Indeed, it is even hard for a user to precisely describe what his/her information need is.",
                "What information is available for a system to infer a users information need?",
                "Obviously, the users query provides the most direct evidence.",
                "Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on the query to model a users information need.",
                "However, since a query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished .",
                "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",
                "This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20].",
                "Unfortunately, in real world applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to provide relevant examples for feedback [11].",
                "It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.",
                "Indeed, several previous studies have shown that implicit user modeling can improve retrieval accuracy.",
                "In [3], a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a users explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time, mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback).",
                "It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.",
                "In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking of search results that suits a group of users preferences.",
                "In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information.",
                "For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information.",
                "In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.",
                "Consider the query Java again.",
                "Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",
                "In this paper, we study how to construct and update a user model based on the immediate search context and implicit feedback information and use the model to improve the accuracy of ad-hoc retrieval.",
                "In order to maximally benefit the user of a retrieval system through implicit user modeling, we propose to perform eager implicit feedback.",
                "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model.",
                "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
                "In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values.",
                "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
                "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling.",
                "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback.",
                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
                "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",
                "That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.",
                "In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.",
                "Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.",
                "In both cases, the current (updated) user model would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.",
                "To rerank any unseen document summaries, UCAIR uses the standard vector space retrieval model and scores each summary based on the similarity of the result and the current user information need vector x [21].",
                "Since implicit feedback is not completely reliable, we bring up only a small number (e.g. 5) of highest reranked results to be followed by any originally high ranked results. 828 Google result (user query = java map) UCAIR result (user query =java map) previous query = travel Indonesia previous query = hashtable expanded user query = java map Indonesia expanded user query = java map class 1 Java map projections of the world ...

                "In Table 1, we show how UCAIR can successfully distinguish two different search contexts for the query java map, corresponding to two different previous queries (i.e., travel Indonesia vs. hashtable).",
                "Due to implicit user modeling, UCAIR intelligently figures out to add Indonesia and class, respectively, to the users query java map, which would otherwise be ambiguous as shown in the original results from Google on March 21, 2005.",
                "UCAIRs results are much more accurate than Googles results and reflect personalization in search.",
                "The eager implicit feedback component is designed to immediately respond to a users activity such as viewing a document.",

                "In this case, the initial retrieval results using jaguar (shown on the left side) contain two results about the Jaguar cars followed by two results about the Jaguar software.",
                "However, after the user views the web page content of the second result (about Jaguar car) and returns to the search result page by clicking Back button, UCAIR automatically nominates two new search results about Jaguar cars (shown on the right side), while the original two results about Jaguar software are pushed down on the list (unseen from the picture). 5.2 Quantitative evaluation To further evaluate UCAIR quantitatively, we conduct a user study on the effectiveness of the eager implicit feedback component.",
                "It is a challenge to quantitatively evaluate the potential performance improvement of our proposed model and UCAIR over Google in an unbiased way [7].",
                "Here, we design a user study, in which participants would do normal web search and judge a randomly and anonymously mixed set of results from Google and UCAIR at the end of the search session; participants do not know whether a result comes from Google or UCAIR.",

                "The title is a short phrase and may be used as a query to the retrieval system.",
                "The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question.",
                "Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph.",
                "Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics.",
                "For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.",
                "During this process, the participant may view the search results and possibly click on some interesting ones to view the web pages, just as in a normal web search.",
                "There is no requirement or restriction on how many queries the participant must submit or when the participant should stop the search for one topic.",

                "Table 2 shows the average precision at top n documents among 32 topics.",
                "From Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table 2, we see that the search results from UCAIR are consistently better than those from Google by all the measures.",
                "Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents.",
                "One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect.",

                "This inherent non-optimality is seen clearly in the following two cases: (1) Different users may use exactly the same query (e.g., Java) to search for different information (e.g., the Java island in Indonesia or the Java programming language), but existing IR systems return the same results for these users.",

                "The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a users information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task.",
                "Indeed, it is even hard for a user to precisely describe what his/her information need is.",
                "What information is available for a system to infer a users information need?",
                "Obviously, the users query provides the most direct evidence.",
                "Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on the query to model a users information need.",
                "However, since a query is often extremely short, the <br>user model</br> constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished .",
                "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",
                "This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20].",
                "Unfortunately, in real world applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to provide relevant examples for feedback [11].",
                "It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.",

                "In [3], a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a users explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time, mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback).",
                "It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.",
                "In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking of search results that suits a group of users preferences.",
                "In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information.",
                "For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information.",
                "In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.",
                "Consider the query Java again.",
                "Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",

                "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated <br>user model</br>.",
                "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager <br>user model</br> updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",
                "In a traditional retrieval paradigm, the retrieval problem is to match a query with documents and rank documents according to their relevance values.",
                "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit <br>user model</br> is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
                "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic interactive retrieval framework for implicit user modeling.",

                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the interactive retrieval process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) <br>user model</br> updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the <br>user model</br> as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a <br>user model</br>.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current <br>user model</br> is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the <br>user model</br> mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current <br>user model</br> and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current <br>user model</br>.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A <br>user model</br> m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a <br>user model</br>.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our <br>user model</br> is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a <br>user model</br> as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general <br>user model</br> may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a <br>user model</br> mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of <br>user model</br> m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the <br>user model</br> - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new <br>user model</br> can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate <br>user model</br> x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit <br>user model</br> are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current <br>user model</br>. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the <br>user model</br> is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our <br>user model</br> by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
                "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",
                "That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.",
                "In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.",
                "Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the <br>user model</br> is updated.",
                "Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.",
                "In both cases, the current (updated) <br>user model</br> would be used to rerank the unseen results so that the user would see improved search results immediately.",
                "To rerank any unseen document summaries, UCAIR uses the standard vector space retrieval model and scores each summary based on the similarity of the result and the current user information need vector x [21].",
                "Since implicit feedback is not completely reliable, we bring up only a small number (e.g. 5) of highest reranked results to be followed by any originally high ranked results. 828 Google result (user query = java map) UCAIR result (user query =java map) previous query = travel Indonesia previous query = hashtable expanded user query = java map Indonesia expanded user query = java map class 1 Java map projections of the world ...

                "However, after the user views the web page content of the second result (about Jaguar car) and returns to the search result page by clicking Back button, UCAIR automatically nominates two new search results about Jaguar cars (shown on the right side), while the original two results about Jaguar software are pushed down on the list (unseen from the picture). 5.2 Quantitative evaluation To further evaluate UCAIR quantitatively, we conduct a user study on the effectiveness of the eager implicit feedback component.",

                "The title is a short phrase and may be used as a query to the retrieval system.",
                "The description field provides a slightly longer statement of the topic requirement, usually expressed as a single complete sentence or question.",
                "Finally the narrative supplies additional information necessary to fully specify the requirement, expressed in the form of a short paragraph.",
                "Initially, each participant would browse 50 topics either from Terabyte track or Web track and pick 5 or 7 most interesting topics.",
                "For each picked topic, the participant would essentially do the normal web search using UCAIR to find many relevant web pages by using the title of the query topic as the initial keyword query.",
                "During this process, the participant may view the search results and possibly click on some interesting ones to view the web pages, just as in a normal web search.",

                "From Figure 4, Figure 5 and Table 2, we see that the search results from UCAIR are consistently better than those from Google by all the measures.",
                "Moreover, the performance improvement is more dramatic for precision at top 20 documents than that at precision at top 10 documents.",
                "One explanation for this is that the more interaction the user has with the system, the more clickthrough data UCAIR can be expected to collect.",

                "A major deficiency of existing retrieval systems is that they generally lack user modeling and are not adaptive to individual users [17].",
                "This inherent non-optimality is seen clearly in the following two cases: (1) Different users may use exactly the same query (e.g., Java) to search for different information (e.g., the Java island in Indonesia or the Java programming language), but existing IR systems return the same results for these users.",
                "Without considering the actual user, it is impossible to know which sense Java refers to in a query. (2) A users information needs may change over time.",

                "Without recognizing the search context, it would be again impossible to recognize the correct sense.",
                "In order to optimize retrieval accuracy, we clearly need to model the user appropriately and personalize search according to each individual user.",
                "The major goal of user modeling for information retrieval is to accurately model a users information need, which is, unfortunately, a very difficult task.",
                "Indeed, it is even hard for a user to precisely describe what his/her information need is.",
                "What information is available for a system to infer a users information need?",
                "Obviously, the users query provides the most direct evidence.",
                "Indeed, most existing retrieval systems rely solely on the query to model a users information need.",
                "However, since a query is often extremely short, the user model constructed based on a keyword query is inevitably impoverished .",
                "An effective way to improve user modeling in information retrieval is to ask the user to explicitly specify which documents are relevant (i.e., useful for satisfying his/her information need), and then to improve user modeling based on such examples of relevant documents.",
                "This is called relevance feedback, which has been proved to be quite effective for improving retrieval accuracy [19, 20].",
                "Unfortunately, in real world applications, users are usually reluctant to make the extra effort to provide relevant examples for feedback [11].",
                "It is thus very interesting to study how to infer a users information need based on any implicit feedback information, which naturally exists through user interactions and thus does not require any extra user effort.",

                "In [3], a web browser (Curious Browser) is developed to record a users explicit relevance ratings of web pages (relevance feedback) and browsing behavior when viewing a page, such as dwelling time, mouse click, mouse movement and scrolling (implicit feedback).",
                "It is shown that the dwelling time on a page, amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling have a strong correlation with explicit relevance ratings, which suggests that implicit feedback may be helpful for inferring user information need.",
                "In [10], user clickthrough data is collected as training data to learn a retrieval function, which is used to produce a customized ranking of search results that suits a group of users preferences.",
                "In [25], the clickthrough data collected over a long time period is exploited through query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. 824 While a user may have general long term interests and preferences for information, often he/she is searching for documents to satisfy an ad-hoc information need, which only lasts for a short period of time; once the information need is satisfied, the user would generally no longer be interested in such information.",
                "For example, a user may be looking for information about used cars in order to buy one, but once the user has bought a car, he/she is generally no longer interested in such information.",
                "In such cases, implicit feedback information collected over a long period of time is unlikely to be very useful, but the immediate search context and feedback information, such as which of the search results for the current information need are viewed, can be expected to be much more useful.",
                "Consider the query Java again.",
                "Any of the following immediate feedback information about the user could potentially help determine the intended meaning of Java in the query: (1) The previous query submitted by the user is hashtable (as opposed to, e.g., travel Indonesia). (2) In the search results, the user viewed a page where words such as programming, software, and applet occur many times.",
                "To the best of our knowledge, how to exploit such immediate and short-term search context to improve search has so far not been well addressed in the previous work.",

                "That is, as soon as we observe any new piece of evidence from the user, we would update the systems belief about the users information need and respond with improved retrieval results based on the updated user model.",
                "We present a decision-theoretic framework for optimizing interactive information retrieval based on eager user model updating, in which the system responds to every action of the user by choosing a system action to optimize a utility function.",

                "As a result, the retrieval process is a simple independent cycle of query and result display.",
                "In the proposed new retrieval paradigm, the users search context plays an important role and the inferred implicit user model is exploited immediately to benefit the user.",
                "The new retrieval paradigm is thus fundamentally different from the traditional paradigm, and is inherently more general.",
                "We further propose specific techniques to capture and exploit two types of implicit feedback information: (1) identifying related immediately preceding query and using the query and the corresponding search results to select appropriate terms to expand the current query, and (2) exploiting the viewed document summaries to immediately rerank any documents that have not yet been seen by the user.",
                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent UCAIR (User-Centered Adaptive Information Retrieval) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",
                "Experiments on web search show that our search agent can improve search accuracy over Google.",
                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
                "Thus the developed search agent can improve existing web search performance without additional effort from the user.",
                "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
                "In Section 2, we discuss the related work.",
                "In Section 3, we present a decisiontheoretic <br>interactive retrieval</br> framework for implicit user modeling.",
                "In Section 4, we present the design and implementation of an intelligent client-side web search agent (UCAIR) that performs eager implicit feedback.",
                "In Section 5, we report our experiment results using the search agent.",
                "Section 6 concludes our work. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Implicit user modeling for personalized search has been studied in previous work, but our work differs from all previous work in several aspects: (1) We emphasize the exploitation of immediate search context such as the related immediately preceding query and the viewed documents in the same session, while most previous work relies on long-term collection of implicit feedback information [25]. (2) We perform eager feedback and bring the benefit of implicit user modeling as soon as any new implicit feedback information is available, while the previous work mostly exploits longterm implicit feedback [10]. (3) We propose a retrieval framework to integrate implicit user modeling with the <br>interactive retrieval</br> process, while the previous work either studies implicit user modeling separately from retrieval [3] or only studies specific retrieval models for exploiting implicit feedback to better match a query with documents [23, 27, 22]. (4) We develop and evaluate a personalized Web search agent with online user studies, while most existing work evaluates algorithms offline without real user interactions.",
                "Currently some search engines provide rudimentary personalization, such as Google Personalized web search [6], which allows users to explicitly describe their interests by selecting from predefined topics, so that those results that match their interests are brought to the top, and My Yahoo! search [16], which gives users the option to save web sites they like and block those they dislike.",
                "In contrast, UCAIR personalizes web search through implicit user modeling without any additional user efforts.",
                "Furthermore, the personalization of UCAIR is provided on the client side.",
                "There are two remarkable advantages on this.",
                "First, the user does not need to worry about the privacy infringement, which is a big concern for personalized search [26].",
                "Second, both the computation of personalization and the storage of the user profile are done at the client side so that the server load is reduced dramatically [9].",
                "There have been many works studying user query logs [1] or query dynamics [13].",
                "UCAIR makes direct use of a users query history to benefit the same user immediately in the same search session.",
                "UCAIR first judges whether two neighboring queries belong to the same information session and if so, it selects terms from the previous query to perform query expansion.",
                "Our query expansion approach is similar to automatic query expansion [28, 15, 5], but instead of using pseudo feedback to expand the query, we use users implicit feedback information to expand the current query.",
                "These two techniques may be combined. 3.",
                "OPTIMIZATION IN INTERACTIVE IR In interactive IR, a user interacts with the retrieval system through an action dialogue, in which the system responds to each user action with some system action.",
                "For example, the users action may be submitting a query and the systems response may be returning a list of 10 document summaries.",
                "In general, the space of user actions and system responses and their granularities would depend on the interface of a particular retrieval system.",
                "In principle, every action of the user can potentially provide new evidence to help the system better infer the users information need.",
                "Thus in order to respond optimally, the system should use all the evidence collected so far about the user when choosing a response.",
                "When viewed in this way, most existing search engines are clearly non-optimal.",
                "For example, if a user has viewed some documents on the first page of search results, when the user clicks on the Next link to fetch more results, an existing retrieval system would still return the next page of results retrieved based on the original query without considering the new evidence that a particular result has been viewed by the user. 825 We propose to optimize retrieval performance by adapting system responses based on every action that a user has taken, and cast the optimization problem as a decision task.",
                "Specifically, at any time, the system would attempt to do two tasks: (1) User model updating: Monitor any useful evidence from the user regarding his/her information need and update the user model as soon as such evidence is available; (2) Improving search results: Rerank immediately all the documents that the user has not yet seen, as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "We emphasize eager updating and reranking, which makes our work quite different from any existing work.",
                "Below we present a formal decision theoretic framework for optimizing retrieval performance through implicit user modeling in interactive information retrieval. 3.1 A decision-theoretic framework Let A be the set of all user actions and R(a) be the set of all possible system responses to a user action a ∈ A.",
                "At any time, let At = (a1, ..., at) be the observed sequence of user actions so far (up to time point t) and Rt−1 = (r1, ..., rt−1) be the responses that the system has made responding to the user actions.",
                "The systems goal is to choose an optimal response rt ∈ R(at) for the current user action at.",
                "Let M be the space of all possible user models.",
                "We further define a loss function L(a, r, m) ∈ , where a ∈ A is a user action, r ∈ R(a) is a system response, and m ∈ M is a user model.",
                "L(a, r, m) encodes our decision preferences and assesses the optimality of responding with r when the current user model is m and the current user action is a.",
                "According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision at time t is to choose a response that minimizes the Bayes risk, i.e., r∗ t = argmin r∈R(at) M L(at, r, mt)P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1)dmt (1) where P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is the posterior probability of the user model mt given all the observations about the user U we have made up to time t. To simplify the computation of Equation 1, let us assume that the posterior probability mass P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1) is mostly concentrated on the mode m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "We can then approximate the integral with the value of the loss function at m∗ t .",
                "That is, r∗ t ≈ argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, m∗ t ) (2) where m∗ t = argmaxmt P(mt|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "Leaving aside how to define and estimate these probabilistic models and the loss function, we can see that such a decision-theoretic formulation suggests that, in order to choose the optimal response to at, the system should perform two tasks: (1) compute the current user model and obtain m∗ t based on all the useful information. (2) choose a response rt to minimize the loss function value L(at, rt, m∗ t ).",
                "When at does not affect our belief about m∗ t , the first step can be omitted and we may reuse m∗ t−1 for m∗ t .",
                "Note that our framework is quite general since we can potentially model any kind of user actions and system responses.",
                "In most cases, as we may expect, the systems response is some ranking of documents, i.e., for most actions a, R(a) consists of all the possible rankings of the unseen documents, and the decision problem boils down to choosing the best ranking of unseen documents based on the most current user model.",
                "When a is the action of submitting a keyword query, such a response is exactly what a current retrieval system would do.",
                "However, we can easily imagine that a more intelligent web search engine would respond to a users clicking of the Next link (to fetch more unseen results) with a more optimized ranking of documents based on any viewed documents in the current page of results.",
                "In fact, according to our eager updating strategy, we may even allow a system to respond to a users clicking of browsers Back button after viewing a document in the same way, so that the user can maximally benefit from implicit feedback.",
                "These are precisely what our UCAIR system does. 3.2 User models A user model m ∈ M represents what we know about the user U, so in principle, it can contain any information about the user that we wish to model.",
                "We now discuss two important components in a user model.",
                "The first component is a component model of the users information need.",
                "Presumably, the most important factor affecting the optimality of the systems response is how well the response addresses the users information need.",
                "Indeed, at any time, we may assume that the system has some belief about what the user is interested in, which we model through a term vector x = (x1, ..., x|V |), where V = {w1, ..., w|V |} is the set of all terms (i.e., vocabulary) and xi is the weight of term wi.",
                "Such a term vector is commonly used in information retrieval to represent both queries and documents.",
                "For example, the vector-space model, assumes that both the query and the documents are represented as term vectors and the score of a document with respect to a query is computed based on the similarity between the query vector and the document vector [21].",
                "In a language modeling approach, we may also regard the query unigram language model [12, 29] or the relevance model [14] as a term vector representation of the users information need.",
                "Intuitively, x would assign high weights to terms that characterize the topics which the user is interested in.",
                "The second component we may include in our user model is the documents that the user has already viewed.",
                "Obviously, even if a document is relevant, if the user has already seen the document, it would not be useful to present the same document again.",
                "We thus introduce another variable S ⊂ D (D is the whole set of documents in the collection) to denote the subset of documents in the search results that the user has already seen/viewed.",
                "In general, at time t, we may represent a user model as mt = (S, x, At, Rt−1), where S is the seen documents, x is the systems understanding of the users information need, and (At, Rt−1) represents the users interaction history.",
                "Note that an even more general user model may also include other factors such as the users reading level and occupation.",
                "If we assume that the uncertainty of a user model mt is solely due to the uncertainty of x, the computation of our current estimate of user model m∗ t will mainly involve computing our best estimate of x.",
                "That is, the system would choose a response according to r∗ t = argminr∈R(at)L(at, r, S, x∗ , At, Rt−1) (3) where x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1).",
                "This is the decision mechanism implemented in the UCAIR system to be described later.",
                "In this system, we avoided specifying the probabilistic model P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1) by computing x∗ directly with some existing feedback method. 3.3 Loss functions The exact definition of loss function L depends on the responses, thus it is inevitably application-specific.",
                "We now briefly discuss some possibilities when the response is to rank all the unseen documents and present the top k of them.",
                "Let r = (d1, ..., dk) be the top k documents, S be the set of seen documents by the user, and x∗ be the systems best guess of the users information need.",
                "We 826 may simply define the loss associated with r as the negative sum of the probability that each of the di is relevant, i.e., L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(relevant|di, m).",
                "Clearly, in order to minimize this loss function, the optimal response r would contain the k documents with the highest probability of relevance, which is intuitively reasonable.",
                "One deficiency of this top-k loss function is that it is not sensitive to the internal order of the selected top k documents, so switching the ranking order of a non-relevant document and a relevant one would not affect the loss, which is unreasonable.",
                "To model ranking, we can introduce a factor of the user model - the probability of each of the k documents being viewed by the user, P(view|di), and define the following ranking loss function: L(a, r, m) = − k i=1 P(view|di)P(relevant|di, m) Since in general, if di is ranked above dj (i.e., i < j), P(view|di) > P(view|dj), this loss function would favor a decision to rank relevant documents above non-relevant ones, as otherwise, we could always switch di with dj to reduce the loss value.",
                "Thus the system should simply perform a regular retrieval and rank documents according to the probability of relevance [18].",
                "Depending on the users retrieval preferences, there can be many other possibilities.",
                "For example, if the user does not want to see redundant documents, the loss function should include some redundancy measure on r based on the already seen documents S. Of course, when the response is not to choose a ranked list of documents, we would need a different loss function.",
                "We discuss one such example that is relevant to the search agent that we implement.",
                "When a user enters a query qt (current action), our search agent relies on some existing search engine to actually carry out search.",
                "In such a case, even though the search agent does not have control of the retrieval algorithm, it can still attempt to optimize the search results through refining the query sent to the search engine and/or reranking the results obtained from the search engine.",
                "The loss functions for reranking are already discussed above; we now take a look at the loss functions for query refinement.",
                "Let f be the retrieval function of the search engine that our agent uses so that f(q) would give us the search results using query q.",
                "Given that the current action of the user is entering a query qt (i.e., at = qt), our response would be f(q) for some q.",
                "Since we have no choice of f, our decision is to choose a good q.",
                "Formally, r∗ t = argminrt L(a, rt, m) = argminf(q)L(a, f(q), m) = f(argminqL(qt, f(q), m)) which shows that our goal is to find q∗ = argminqL(qt, f(q), m), i.e., an optimal query that would give us the best f(q).",
                "A different choice of loss function L(qt, f(q), m) would lead to a different query refinement strategy.",
                "In UCAIR, we heuristically compute q∗ by expanding qt with terms extracted from rt−1 whenever qt−1 and qt have high similarity.",
                "Note that rt−1 and qt−1 are contained in m as part of the users interaction history. 3.4 Implicit user modeling Implicit user modeling is captured in our framework through the computation of x∗ = argmaxx P(x|U, D, At, Rt−1), i.e., the systems current belief of what the users information need is.",
                "Here again there may be many possibilities, leading to different algorithms for implicit user modeling.",
                "We now discuss a few of them.",
                "First, when two consecutive queries are related, the previous query can be exploited to enrich the current query and provide more search context to help disambiguation.",
                "For this purpose, instead of performing query expansion as we did in the previous section, we could also compute an updated x∗ based on the previous query and retrieval results.",
                "The computed new user model can then be used to rank the documents with a standard information retrieval model.",
                "Second, we can also infer a users interest based on the summaries of the viewed documents.",
                "When a user is presented with a list of summaries of top ranked documents, if the user chooses to skip the first n documents and to view the (n+1)-th document, we may infer that the user is not interested in the displayed summaries for the first n documents, but is attracted by the displayed summary of the (n + 1)-th document.",
                "We can thus use these summaries as negative and positive examples to learn a more accurate user model x∗ .",
                "Here many standard relevance feedback techniques can be exploited [19, 20].",
                "Note that we should use the displayed summaries, as opposed to the actual contents of those documents, since it is possible that the displayed summary of the viewed document is relevant, but the document content is actually not.",
                "Similarly, a displayed summary may mislead a user to skip a relevant document.",
                "Inferring user models based on such displayed information, rather than the actual content of a document is an important difference between UCAIR and some other similar systems.",
                "In UCAIR, both of these strategies for inferring an implicit user model are implemented. 4.",
                "UCAIR: A PERSONALIZED SEARCH AGENT 4.1 Design In this section, we present a client-side web search agent called UCAIR, in which we implement some of the methods discussed in the previous section for performing personalized search through implicit user modeling.",
                "UCAIR is a web browser plug-in 1 that acts as a proxy for web search engines.",
                "Currently, it is only implemented for Internet Explorer and Google, but it is a matter of engineering to make it run on other web browsers and interact with other search engines.",
                "The issue of privacy is a primary obstacle for deploying any real world applications involving serious user modeling, such as personalized search.",
                "For this reason, UCAIR is strictly running as a client-side search agent, as opposed to a server-side application.",
                "This way, the captured user information always resides on the computer that the user is using, thus the user does not need to release any information to the outside.",
                "Client-side personalization also allows the system to easily observe a lot of user information that may not be easily available to a server.",
                "Furthermore, performing personalized search on the client-side is more scalable than on the serverside, since the overhead of computation and storage is distributed among clients.",
                "As shown in Figure 1, the UCAIR toolbar has 3 major components: (1) The (implicit) user modeling module captures a users search context and history information, including the submitted queries and any clicked search results and infers search session boundaries. (2) The query modification module selectively improves the query formulation according to the current user model. (3) The result re-ranking module immediately re-ranks any unseen search results whenever the user model is updated.",
                "In UCAIR, we consider four basic user actions: (1) submitting a keyword query; (2) viewing a document; (3) clicking the Back button; (4) clicking the Next link on a result page.",
                "For each of these four actions, the system responds with, respectively, (1) 1 UCAIR is available at: http://sifaka.cs.uiuc.edu/ir/ucair/download.html 827 Search Engine (e.g., Google) Search History Log (e.g.,past queries, clicked results) Query Modification Result Re-Ranking User Modeling Result Buffer UCAIR Userquery results clickthrough… Figure 1: UCAIR architecture generating a ranked list of results by sending a possibly expanded query to a search engine; (2) updating the information need model x; (3) reranking the unseen results on the current result page based on the current model x; and (4) reranking the unseen pages and generating the next page of results based on the current model x.",
                "Behind these responses, there are three basic tasks: (1) Decide whether the previous query is related to the current query and if so expand the current query with useful terms from the previous query or the results of the previous query. (2) Update the information need model x based on a newly clicked document summary. (3) Rerank a set of unseen documents based on the current model x.",
                "Below we describe our algorithms for each of them. 4.2 Session boundary detection and query expansion To effectively exploit previous queries and their corresponding clickthrough information, UCAIR needs to judge whether two adjacent queries belong to the same search session (i.e., detect session boundaries).",
                "Existing work on session boundary detection is mostly in the context of web log analysis (e.g., [8]), and uses statistical information rather than textual features.",
                "Since our clientside agent does not have access to server query logs, we make session boundary decisions based on textual similarity between two queries.",
                "Because related queries do not necessarily share the same words (e.g., java island and travel Indonesia), it is insufficient to use only query text.",
                "Therefore we use the search results of the two queries to help decide whether they are topically related.",
                "For example, for the above queries java island and travel Indonesia, the words java, bali, island, indonesia and travel may occur frequently in both queries search results, yielding a high similarity score.",
                "We only use the titles and summaries of the search results to calculate the similarity since they are available in the retrieved search result page and fetching the full text of every result page would significantly slow down the process.",
                "To compensate for the terseness of titles and summaries, we retrieve more results than a user would normally view for the purpose of detecting session boundaries (typically 50 results).",
                "The similarity between the previous query q and the current query q is computed as follows.",
                "Let {s1, s2, . . . , sn } and {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be the result sets for the two queries.",
                "We use the pivoted normalization TF-IDF weighting formula [24] to compute a term weight vector si for each result si.",
                "We define the average result savg to be the centroid of all the result vectors, i.e., (s1 + s2 + . . . + sn)/n.",
                "The cosine similarity between the two average results is calculated as s avg · savg/ s 2 avg · s2 avg If the similarity value exceeds a predefined threshold, the two queries will be considered to be in the same information session.",
                "If the previous query and the current query are found to belong to the same search session, UCAIR would attempt to expand the current query with terms from the previous query and its search results.",
                "Specifically, for each term in the previous query or the corresponding search results, if its frequency in the results of the current query is greater than a preset threshold (e.g. 5 results out of 50), the term would be added to the current query to form an expanded query.",
                "In this case, UCAIR would send this expanded query rather than the original one to the search engine and return the results corresponding to the expanded query.",
                "Currently, UCAIR only uses the immediate preceding query for query expansion; in principle, we could exploit all related past queries. 4.3 Information need model updating Suppose at time t, we have observed that the user has viewed k documents whose summaries are s1, ..., sk.",
                "We update our user model by computing a new information need vector with a standard feedback method in information retrieval (i.e., Rocchio [19]).",
                "According to the vector space retrieval model, each clicked summary si can be represented by a term weight vector si with each term weighted by a TF-IDF weighting formula [21].",
                "Rocchio computes the centroid vector of all the summaries and interpolates it with the original query vector to obtain an updated term vector.",
                "That is, x = αq + (1 − α) 1 k k i=1 si where q is the query vector, k is the number of summaries the user clicks immediately following the current query and α is a parameter that controls the influence of the clicked summaries on the inferred information need model.",
                "In our experiments, α is set to 0.5.",
                "Note that we update the information need model whenever the user views a document. 4.4 Result reranking In general, we want to rerank all the unseen results as soon as the user model is updated.",
                "Currently, UCAIR implements reranking in two cases, corresponding to the user clicking the Back button and Next link in the Internet Explorer.",

                "In Table 1, we show how UCAIR can successfully distinguish two different search contexts for the query java map, corresponding to two different previous queries (i.e., travel Indonesia vs. hashtable).",
                "Due to implicit user modeling, UCAIR intelligently figures out to add Indonesia and class, respectively, to the users query java map, which would otherwise be ambiguous as shown in the original results from Google on March 21, 2005.",
                "UCAIRs results are much more accurate than Googles results and reflect personalization in search.",

                "Using these techniques, we develop a client-side web search agent (UCAIR) on top of a popular search engine (Google).",

                "Since the implicit information we exploit already naturally exists through user interactions, the user does not need to make any extra effort.",
