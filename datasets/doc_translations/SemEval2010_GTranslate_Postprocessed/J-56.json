In reality bidders often withdraw winning bids before the transaction when it is in their best interests to do so. Given a bid withdrawal in a combinatorial auction, finding an alternative repair solution of adequate revenue without causing undue disturbance to the remaining winning bids in the original solution may be difficult or even impossible. We have called this the Bid-takers Exposure Problem. When faced with such unreliable bidders, it is preferable for the bid-taker to preempt such uncertainty by having a solution that is robust to bid withdrawal and provides a guarantee that possible withdrawals may be repaired easily with a bounded loss in revenue. In this paper, we propose an approach to addressing the Bidtakers Exposure Problem. Firstly, we use the Weighted Super Solutions framework [13], from the field of constraint programming, to solve the problem of finding a robust solution. A weighted super solution guarantees that any subset of bids likely to be withdrawn can be repaired to form a new solution of at least a given revenue by making limited changes. Secondly, we introduce an auction model that uses a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27], which we have called mutual bid bonds, to improve solution reparability by facilitating backtracking on winning bids by the bid-taker. We then examine the trade-off between robustness and revenue in different economically motivated auction scenarios for different constraints on the revenue of repair solutions. We also demonstrate experimentally that fewer winning bids partake in robust solutions, thereby reducing any associated overhead in dealing with extra bidders. Robust solutions can also provide a means of selectively discriminating against distrusted bidders in a measured manner.

INTRODUCTION A combinatorial auction (CA) [5] provides an efficient means of allocating multiple distinguishable items amongst bidders whose perceived valuations for combinations of items differ. Such auctions are gaining in popularity and there is a proliferation in their usage across various industries such as telecoms, B2B procurement and transportation [11, 19]. Revenue is the most obvious optimization criterion for such auctions, but another desirable attribute is solution robustness. In terms of combinatorial auctions, a robust solution is one that can withstand bid withdrawal (a break) by making changes easily to form a repair solution of adequate revenue. A brittle solution to a CA is one in which an unacceptable loss in revenue is unavoidable if a winning bid is withdrawn. In such situations the bid-taker may be left with a set of items deemed to be of low value by all other bidders. These bidders may associate a higher value for these items if they were combined with items already awarded to others, hence the bid-taker is left in an undesirable local optimum in which a form of backtracking is required to reallocate the items in a manner that results in sufficient revenue. We have called this the Bid-takers Exposure Problem that bears similarities to the Exposure Problem faced by bidders seeking multiple items in separate single-unit auctions but holding little or no value for a subset of those items. However, reallocating items may be regarded as disruptive to a solution in many real-life scenarios. Consider a scenario where procurement for a business is conducted using a CA. It would be highly undesirable to retract contracts from a group of suppliers because of the failure of a third party. A robust solution that is tolerant of such breaks is preferable. Robustness may be regarded as a preventative measure protecting against future uncertainty by sacrificing revenue in place of solution stability and reparability. We assume a probabilistic approach whereby the bid-taker has knowledge of the reliability of bidders from which the likelihood of an incomplete transaction may be inferred. Repair solutions are required for bids that are seen as brittle (i.e. likely to break). Repairs may also be required for sets of bids deemed brittle. We propose the use of the Weighted Super 183 Solutions (WSS) framework [13] for constraint programming, that is ideal for establishing such robust solutions. As we shall see, this framework can enforce constraints on solutions so that possible breakages are reparable. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the Winner Determination Problem (WDP) for combinatorial auctions, outlines some possible reasons for bid withdrawal and shows how simply maximizing expected revenue can lead to intolerable revenue losses for risk-averse bid-takers. This motivates the use of robust solutions and Section 3 introduces a constraint programming (CP) framework, Weighted Super Solutions [13], that finds such solutions. We then propose an auction model in Section 4 that enhances reparability by introducing mandatory mutual bid bonds, that may be seen as a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27]. Section 5 presents an extensive empirical evaluation of the approach presented in this paper, in the context of a number of well-known combinatorial auction distributions, with very encouraging results. Section 6 discusses possible extensions and questions raised by our research that deserve future work. Finally, in Section 7 a number of concluding remarks are made. 2. COMBINATORIAL AUCTIONS Before presenting the technical details of our solution to the Bid-takers Exposure Problem, we shall present a brief survey of combinatorial auctions and existing techniques for handling bid withdrawal. Combinatorial auctions involve a single bid-taker allocating multiple distinguishable items amongst a group of bidders. The bidtaker has a set of m items for sale, M = {1, 2, . . . , m}, and bidders submit a set of bids, B = {B1, B2, . . . , Bn}. A bid is a tuple Bj = Sj, pj where Sj ⊆ M is a subset of the items for sale and pj ≥ 0 is a price. The WDP for a CA is to label all bids as either winning or losing so as to maximize the revenue from winning bids without allocating any item to more than one bid. The following is the integer programming formulation for the WDP: max n j=1 pjxj s.t. j|i∈Sj xj ≤ 1, ∀i ∈ {1 . . . m}, xj ∈ {0, 1}. This problem is NP-complete [23] and inapproximable [25], and is otherwise known as the Set Packing Problem. The above problem formulation assumes the notion of free disposal. This means that the optimal solution need not necessarily sell all of the items. If the auction rules stipulate that all items must be sold, the problem becomes a Set Partition Problem [5]. The WDP has been extensively studied in recent years. The fastest search algorithms that find optimal solutions (e.g. CABOB [25]) can, in practice, solve very large problems involving thousands of bids very quickly. 2.1 The Problem of Bid Withdrawal We assume an auction protocol with a three stage process involving the submission of bids, winner determination, and finally a transaction phase. We are interested in bid withdrawals that occur between the announcement of winning bids and the end of the transaction phase. All bids are valid until the transaction is complete, so we anticipate an expedient transaction process1 . 1 In some instances the transaction period may be so lengthy that consideration of non-winning bids as still being valid may not be fair. Breaks that occur during a lengthy transaction phase are more difficult to remedy and may require a subsequent auction. For example, if the item is a service contract for a given period of time and the break occurs after partial fulfilment of this contract, the other An example of a winning bid withdrawal occurred in an FCC spectrum auction [32]. Withdrawals, or breaks, may occur for various reasons. Bid withdrawal may be instigated by the bid-taker when Quality of Service agreements are broken or payment deadlines are not met. We refer to bid withdrawal by the bid-taker as item withdrawal in this paper to distinguish between the actions of a bidder and the bid-taker. Harstad and Rothkopf [8] outlined several possibilities for breaks in single item auctions that include: 1. an erroneous initial valuation/bid; 2. unexpected events outside the winning bidders control; 3. a desire to have the second-best bid honored; 4. information obtained or events that occurred after the auction but before the transaction that reduces the value of an item; 5. the revelation of competing bidders valuations infers reduced profitability, a problem known as the Winners Curse. Kastner et al. [15] examined how to handle perturbations given a solution whilst minimizing necessary changes to that solution. These perturbations may include bid withdrawals, change of valuation/items of a bid or the submission of a new bid. They looked at the problem of finding incremental solutions to restructure a supply chain whose formation is determined using combinatorial auctions [30]. Following a perturbation in the optimal solution they proceed to impose involuntary item withdrawals from winning bidders. They formulated an incremental integer linear program (ILP) that sought to maximize the valuation of the repair solution whilst preserving the previous solution as much as possible. 2.2 Being Proactive against Bid Withdrawal When a bid is withdrawn there may be constraints on how the solution can be repaired. If the bid-taker was freely able to revoke the awarding of items to other bidders then the solution could be repaired easily by reassigning all the items to the optimal solution without the withdrawn bid. Alternatively, the bidder who reneged upon a bid may have all his other bids disqualified and the items could be reassigned based on the optimum solution without that bidder present. However, the bid-taker is often unable to freely reassign the items already awarded to other bidders. When items cannot be withdrawn from winning bidders, following the failure of another bidder to honor his bid, repair solutions are restricted to the set of bids whose items only include those in the bid(s) that were reneged upon. We are free to award items to any of the previously unsuccessful bids when finding a repair solution. When faced with uncertainty over the reliability of bidders a possible approach is to maximize expected revenue. This approach does not make allowances for risk-averse bid-takers who may view a small possibility of very low revenue as unacceptable. Consider the example in Table 1, and the optimal expected revenue in the situation where a single bid may be withdrawn. There are three submitted bids for items A and B, the third being a combination bid for the pair of items at a value of 190. The optimal solution has a value of 200, with the first and second bids as winners. When we consider the probabilities of failure, in the fourth column, the problem of which solution to choose becomes more difficult. Computing the expected revenue for the solution with the first and second bids winning the items, denoted 1, 1, 0 , gives: (200×0.9×0.9)+(2×100×0.9×0.1)+(190×0.1×0.1) = 181.90. bidders valuations for the item may have decreased in a non-linear fashion. 184 Table 1: Example Combinatorial Auction. Items Bids A B AB Withdrawal prob x1 100 0 0 0.1 x2 0 100 0 0.1 x3 0 0 190 0.1 If a single bid is withdrawn there is probability of 0.18 of a revenue of 100, given the fact that we cannot withdraw an item from the other winning bidder. The expected revenue for 0, 0, 1 is: (190 × 0.9) + (200 × 0.1) = 191.00. We can therefore surmise that the second solution is preferable to the first based on expected revenue. Determining the maximum expected revenue in the presence of such uncertainty becomes computationally infeasible however, as the number of brittle bids grows. A WDP needs to be solved for all possible combinations of bids that may fail. The possible loss in revenue for breaks is also not tightly bounded using this approach, therefore a large loss may be possible for a small number of breaks. Consider the previous example where the bid amount for x3 becomes 175. The expected revenue of 1, 1, 0 (181.75) becomes greater than that of 0, 0, 1 (177.50). There are some bid-takers who may prefer the latter solution because the revenue is never less than 175, but the former solution returns revenue of only 100 with probability 0.18. A risk-averse bid-taker may not tolerate such a possibility, preferring to sacrifice revenue for reduced risk. If we modify our repair search so that a solution of at least a given revenue is guaranteed, the search for a repair solution becomes a satisfiability test rather than an optimization problem. The approaches described above are in contrast to that which we propose in the next section. Our approach can be seen as preventative in that we find an initial allocation of items to bidders which is robust to bid withdrawal. Possible losses in revenue are bounded by a fixed percentage of the true optimal allocation. Perturbations to the original solution are also limited so as to minimize disruption. We regard this as the ideal approach for real-world combinatorial auctions. DEFINITION 1 (ROBUST SOLUTION FOR A CA). A robust solution for a combinatorial auction is one where any subset of successful bids whose probability of withdrawal is greater than or equal to α can be repaired by reassigning items at a cost of at most β to other previously losing bids to form a repair solution. Constraints on acceptable revenue, e.g. being a minimum percentage of the optimum, are defined in the problem model and are thus satisfied by all solutions. The maximum cost of repair, β, may be a fixed value that may be thought of as a fund for compensating winning bidders whose items are withdrawn from them when creating a repair solution. Alternatively, β may be a function of the bids that were withdrawn. Section 4 will give an example of such a mechanism. In the following section we describe an ideal constraint-based framework for the establishment of such robust solutions. 3. FINDING ROBUST SOLUTIONS In constraint programming [4] (CP), a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) is modeled as a set of n variables X = {x1, . . . , xn}, a set of domains D = {D(x1), . . . , D(xn)}, where D(xi) is the set of finite possible values for variable xi and a set C = {C1, . . . , Cm} of constraints, each restricting the assignments of some subset of the variables in X. Constraint satisfaction involves finding values for each of the problem variables such that all constraints are satisfied. Its main advantages are its declarative nature and flexibility in tackling problems with arbitrary side constraints. Constraint optimization seeks to find a solution to a CSP that optimizes some objective function. A common technique for solving constraint optimization problems is to use branch-and-bound techniques that avoid exploring sub-trees that are known not to contain a better solution than the best found so far. An initial bound can be determined by finding a solution that satisfies all constraints in C or by using some heuristic methods. A classical super solution (SS) is a solution to a CSP in which, if a small number of variables lose their values, repair solutions are guaranteed with only a few changes, thus providing solution robustness [9, 10]. It is a generalization of both fault tolerance in CP [31] and supermodels in propositional satisfiability (SAT) [7]. An (a,b)-super solution is one in which if at most a variables lose their values, a repair solution can be found by changing at most b other variables [10]. Super solutions for combinatorial auctions minimize the number of bids whose status needs to be changed when forming a repair solution [12]. Only a particular set of variables in the solution may be subject to change and these are said to be members of the breakset. For each combination of brittle assignments in the break-set, a repair-set is required that comprises the set of variables whose values must change to provide another solution. The cardinality of the repair set is used to measure the cost of repair. In reality, changing some variable assignments in a repair solution incurs a lower cost than others thereby motivating the use of a different metric for determining the legality of repair sets. The Weighted Super Solution (WSS) framework [13] considers the cost of repair required, rather than simply the number of assignments modified, to form an alternative solution. For CAs this may be a measure of the compensation penalties paid to winning bidders to break existing agreements. Robust solutions are particularly desirable for applications where unreliability is a problem and potential breakages may incur severe penalties. Weighted super solutions offer a means of expressing which variables are easily re-assigned and those that incur a heavy cost [13]. Hebrard et al. [9] describe how some variables may fail (such as machines in a job-shop problem) and others may not. A WSS generalizes this approach so that there is a probability of failure associated with each assignment and sets of variables whose assignments have probabilities of failure greater than or equal to a threshold value, α, require repair solutions. A WSS measures the cost of repairing, or reassigning, other variables using inertia as a metric. Inertia is a measure of a variables aversion to change and depends on its current assignment, future assignment and the breakage variable(s). It may be desirable to reassign items to different bidders in order to find a repair solution of satisfactory revenue. Compensation may have to be paid to bidders who lose items during the formation of a repair solution. The inertia of a bid reflects the cost of changing its state. For winning bids this may reflect the necessary compensation penalty for the bid-taker to break the agreement (if such breaches are permitted), whereas for previously losing bids this is a free operation. The total amount of compensation payable to bidders may depend upon other factors, such as the cause of the break. There is a limit to how much these overall repair costs should be, and this is given by the value β. This value may not be known in advance and 185 Algorithm 1: WSS(int level, double α, double β):Boolean begin if level > number of variables then return true choose unassigned variable x foreach value v in the domain of x do assign x : v if problem is consistent then foreach combination of brittle assignments, A do if ¬reparable(A, β) then return false; if WSS(level+1) then return true unassign x return false end may depend upon the break. Therefore, β may be viewed as the fund used to compensate winning bidders for the unilateral withdrawal of their bids by the bid-taker. In summary, an (α,β)-WSS allows any set of variables whose probability of breaking is greater than or equal to α be repaired with changes to the original robust solution with a cost of at most β. The depth-first search for a WSS (see pseudo-code description in Algorithm 1) maintains arc-consistency [24] at each node of the tree. As search progresses, the reparability of each previous assignment is verified at each node by extending a partial repair solution to the same depth as the current partial solution. This may be thought of as maintaining concurrent search trees for repairs. A repair solution is provided for every possible set of break variables, A. The WSS algorithm attempts to extend the current partial assignment by choosing a variable and assigning it a value. Backtracking may then occur for one of two reasons: we cannot extend the assignment to satisfy the given constraints, or the current partial assignment cannot be associated with a repair solution whose cost of repair is less than β should a break occur. The procedure reparable searches for partial repair solutions using backtracking and attempts to extend the last repair found, just as in (1,b)super solutions [9]; the differences being that a repair is provided for a set of breakage variables rather than a single variable and the cost of repair is considered. A summation operator is used to determine the overall cost of repair. If a fixed bound upon the size of any potential break-set can be formed, the WSS algorithm is NPcomplete. For a more detailed description of the WSS search algorithm, the reader is referred to [13], since a complete description of the algorithm is beyond the scope of this paper. EXAMPLE 1. We shall step through the example given in Table 1 when searching for a WSS. Each bid is represented by a single variable with domain values of 0 and 1, the former representing bid-failure and the latter bid-success. The probability of failure of the variables are 0.1 when they are assigned to 1 and 0.0 otherwise. The problem is initially solved using an ILP solver such as lp_solve [3] or CPLEX, and the optimal revenue is found to be 200. A fixed percentage of this revenue can be used as a threshold value for a robust solution and its repairs. The bid-taker wishes to have a robust solution so that if a single winning bid is withdrawn, a repair solution can be formed without withdrawing items from any other winning bidder. This example may be seen as searching for a (0.1,0)-weighted super solution, β is 0 because no funds are available to compensate the withdrawal of items from winning bidders. The bid-taker is willing to compromise on revenue, but only by 5%, say, of the optimal value. Bids 1 and 3 cannot both succeed, since they both require item A, so a constraint is added precluding the assignment in which both variables take the value 1. Similarly, bids 2 and 3 cannot both win so another constraint is added between these two variables. Therefore, in this example the set of CSP variables is V = {x1, x2, x3}, whose domains are all {0, 1}. The constraints are x1 + x3 ≤ 1, x2 + x3 ≤ 1 and xi∈V aixi ≥ 190, where ai reflects the relevant bid-amounts for the respective bid variables. In order to find a robust solution of optimal revenue we seek to maximize the sum of these amounts, max xi∈V aixi. When all variables are set to 0 (see Figure 1(a) branch 3), this is not a solution because the minimum revenue of 190 has not been met, so we try assigning bid3 to 1 (branch 4). This is a valid solution but this variable is brittle because there is a 10% chance that this bid may be withdrawn (see Table 1). Therefore we need to determine if a repair can be formed should it break. The search for a repair begins at the first node, see Figure 1(b). Notice that value 1 has been removed from bid3 because this search tree is simulating the withdrawal of this bid. When bid1 is set to 0 (branch 4.1), the maximum revenue solution in the remaining subtree has revenue of only 100, therefore search is discontinued at that node of the tree. Bid1 and bid2 are both assigned to 1 (branches 4.2 and 4.4) and the total cost of both these changes is still 0 because no compensation needs to be paid for bids that change from losing to winning. With bid3 now losing (branch 4.5), this gives a repair solution of 200. Hence 0, 0, 1 is reparable and therefore a WSS. We continue our search in Figure 1(a) however, because we are seeking a robust solution of optimal revenue. When bid1 is assigned to 1 (branch 6) we seek a partial repair for this variable breaking (branch 5 is not considered since it offers insufficient revenue). The repair search sets bid1 to 0 in a separate search tree, (not shown), and control is returned to the search for a WSS. Bid2 is set to 0 (branch 7), but this solution would not produce sufficient revenue so bid2 is then set to 1 (branch 8). We then attempt to extend the repair for bid1 (not shown). This fails because the repair for bid1 cannot assign bid2 to 0 because the cost of repairing such an assignment would be ∞, given that the auction rules do not permit the withdrawal of items from winning bids. A repair for bid1 breaking is therefore not possible because items have already been awarded to bid2. A repair solution with bid2 assigned to 1 does not produce sufficient revenue when bid1 is assigned to 0. The inability to withdraw items from winning bids implies that 1, 1, 0 is an irreparable solution when the minimum tolerable revenue is greater than 100. The italicized comments and dashed line in Figure 1(a) illustrate the search path for a WSS if both of these bids were deemed reparable. Section 4 introduces an alternative auction model that will allow the bid-taker to receive compensation for breakages and in turn use this payment to compensate other bidders for withdrawal of items from winning bids. This will enable the reallocation of items and permit the establishment of 1, 1, 0 as a second WSS for this example. 4. MUTUAL BID BONDS: A BACKTRACKING MECHANISM Some auction solutions are inherently brittle and it may be impossible to find a robust solution. If we can alter the rules of an auction so that the bid-taker can retract items from winning bidders, then the reparability of solutions to such auctions may be improved. In this section we propose an auction model that permits bid and item withdrawal by the bidders and bid-taker, respectively. We propose a model that incorporates mutual bid bonds to enable solution reparability for the bid-taker, a form of insurance against 186 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Insufficient revenue Find repair solution for bid 3 breakage Find partial repair for bid 1 breakage Insufficient revenue (a) Extend partial repair for bid 1 breakage (b) Find partial repair for bid 2 breakage Bid 1 Bid 2 Bid 3 Find repair solutions for bid 1 & 2 breakages [0] [190] [100] [100] [200] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Insufficient revenue (a) Search for WSS. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Insufficient revenue Insufficient revenue Bid 1 Bid 2 Bid 3 inertia=0 inertia=0 inertia=0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 (b) Search for a repair for bid 3 breakage. Figure 1: Search Tree for a WSS without item withdrawal. the winners curse for the bidder whilst also compensating bidders in the case of item withdrawal from winning bids. We propose that such Winners Curse & Bid-takers Exposure insurance comprise a fixed percentage, κ, of the bid amount for all bids. Such mutual bid bonds are mandatory for each bid in our model2 . The conditions attached to the bid bonds are that the bid-taker be allowed to annul winning bids (item withdrawal) when repairing breaks elsewhere in the solution. In the interests of fairness, compensation is paid to bidders from whom items are withdrawn and is equivalent to the penalty that would have been imposed on the bidder should he have withdrawn the bid. Combinatorial auctions impose a heavy computational burden on the bidder so it is important that the hedging of risk should be a simple and transparent operation for the bidder so as not to further increase this burden unnecessarily. We also contend that it is imperative that the bidder knows the potential penalty for withdrawal in advance of bid submission. This information is essential for bidders when determining how aggressive they should be in their bidding strategy. Bid bonds are commonplace in procurement for construction projects. Usually they are mandatory for all bids, are a fixed percentage, κ, of the bid amount and are unidirectional in that item withdrawal by the bid-taker is not permitted. Mutual bid bonds may be seen as a form of leveled commitment contract in which both parties may break the contract for the same fixed penalty. Such contracts permit unilateral decommitment for prespecified penalties. Sandholm et al. showed that this can increase the expected payoffs of all parties and enables deals that would be impossible under full commitment [26, 28, 29]. In practice a bid bond typically ranges between 5 and 20% of the 2 Making the insurance optional may be beneficial in some instances. If a bidder does not agree to the insurance, it may be inferred that he may have accurately determined the valuation for the items and therefore less likely to fall victim to the winners curse. The probability of such a bid being withdrawn may be less, so a repair solution may be deemed unnecessary for this bid. On the other hand it decreases the reparability of solutions. bid amount [14, 18]. If the decommitment penalties are the same for both parties in all bids, κ does not influence the reparability of a given set of bids. It merely influences the levels of penalties and compensation transacted by agents. Low values of κ incur low bid withdrawal penalties and simulate a dictatorial bid-taker who does not adequately compensate bidders for item withdrawal. Andersson and Sandholm [1] found that myopic agents reach a higher social welfare quicker if they act selfishly rather than cooperatively when penalties in leveled commitment contracts are low. Increased levels of bid withdrawal are likely when the penalties are low also. High values of κ tend towards full-commitment and reduce the advantages of such Winners Curse & Bid-takers Exposure insurance. The penalties paid are used to fund a reassignment of items to form a repair solution of sufficient revenue by compensating previously successful bidders for withdrawal of the items from them. EXAMPLE 2. Consider the example given in Table 1 once more, where the bids also comprise a mutual bid bond of 5% of the bid amount. If a bid is withdrawn, the bidder forfeits this amount and the bid-taker can then compensate winning bidders whose items are withdrawn when trying to form a repair solution later. The search for repair solutions for breaks to bid1 and bid2 appear in Figures 2(a) and 2(b), respectively3 . When bid1 breaks, there is a compensation penalty paid to the bid-taker equal to 5 that can be used to fund a reassignment of the items. We therefore set β to 5 and this becomes the maximum expenditure allowed to withdraw items from winning bidders. β may also be viewed as the size of the fund available to facilitate backtracking by the bid-taker. When we extend the partial repair for bid1 so that bid2 loses an item (branch 8.1), the overall cost of repair increases to 5, due to this item withdrawal by the bid-taker, 3 The actual implementation of WSS search checks previous solutions to see if they can repair breaks before searching for a new repair solution. 0, 0, 1 is a solution that has already been found so the search for a repair in this example is not strictly necessary but is described for pedagogical reasons. 187 0 0 0 1 1 Bid 1 Bid 2 Bid 3 Insufficient revenue inertia=5 =5 inertia=0 =5 inertia=5 =5 1 6.1 8.1 9.1 9.2 (a) Search for a repair for bid 1 breakage. 0 0 0 1 1 Bid 1 Bid 2 Bid 3 Insufficient revenue inertia=10 =10 inertia=10 =10 inertia=10 =10 1 8.2 8.3 9.3 9.4 (b) Search for a repair for bid 2 breakage.

The repair solutions for bids 1 and 2 can be extended further by assigning bid3 to 1 (branches 9.2 and 9.4). Therefore, 1, 1, 0 may be considered a robust solution. Recall, that previously this was not the case. Using mutual bid bonds thus increases reparability and allows a robust solution of revenue 200 as opposed to 190, as was previously the case. 5. EXPERIMENTS We have used the Combinatorial Auction Test Suite (CATS) [16] to generate sample auction data. We generated 100 instances of problems in which there are 20 items for sale and 100-2000 bids that may be dominated in some instances4 . Such dominated bids can participate in repair solutions although they do not feature in optimal solutions. CATS uses economically motivated bidding patterns to generate auction data in various scenarios. To motivate the research presented in this paper we use sensitivity analysis to examine the brittleness of optimal solutions and hence determine the types of auctions most likely to benefit from a robust solution. We then establish robust solutions for CAs using the WSS framework. 5.1 Sensitivity Analysis for the WDP We have performed sensitivity analysis of the following four distributions: airport take-off/landing slots (matching), electronic components (arbitrary), property/spectrum-rights (regions) and transportation (paths). These distributions were chosen because they describe a broad array of bidding patterns in different application domains. The method used is as follows. We first of all determined the optimal solution using lp_solve, a mixed integer linear program solver [3]. We then simulated a single bid withdrawal and re-solved the problem with the other winning bids remaining fixed, i.e. there were no involuntary dropouts. The optimal repair solution was then determined. This process is repeated for all winning bids in the overall optimal solution, thus assuming that all bids are brittle. Figure 3 shows the average revenue of such repair solutions as a percentage of the optimum. Also shown is the average worst-case scenario over 100 auctions. We also implemented an auction rule that disallows bids from the reneging bidder participate in a repair5 . Figure 3(a) illustrates how the paths distribution is inherently the most robust distribution since when any winning bid is withdrawn the solution can be repaired to achieve over 98.5% of the 4 The CATS flags included int prices with the bid alpha parameter set to 1000. 5 We assumed that all bids in a given XOR bid with the same dummy item were from the same bidder. optimal revenue on average for auctions with more than 250 bids. There are some cases however when such withdrawals result in solutions whose revenue is significantly lower than optimum. Even in auctions with as many as 2000 bids there are occasions when a single bid withdrawal can result in a drop in revenue of over 5%, although the average worst-case drop in revenue is only 1%. Figure 3(b) shows how the matching distribution is more brittle on average than paths and also has an inferior worst-case revenue on average. This trend continues as the regions-npv (Figure 3(c)) and arbitrary-npv (Figure 3(d)) distributions are more brittle still. These distributions are clearly sensitive to bid withdrawal when no other winning bids in the solution may be involuntarily withdrawn by the bid-taker. 5.2 Robust Solutions using WSS In this section we focus upon both the arbitrary-npv and regions-npv distributions because the sensitivity analysis indicated that these types of auctions produce optimal solutions that tend to be most brittle, and therefore stand to benefit most from solution robustness. We ignore the auctions with 2000 bids because the sensitivity analysis has indicated that these auctions are inherently robust with a very low average drop in revenue following a bid withdrawal. They would also be very computationally expensive, given the extra complexity of finding robust solutions. A pure CP approach needs to be augmented with global constraints that incorporate operations research techniques to increase pruning sufficiently so that thousands of bids may be examined. Global constraints exploit special-purpose filtering algorithms to improve performance [21]. There are a number of ways to speed up the search for a weighted super solution in a CA, although this is not the main focus of our current work. Polynomial matching algorithms may be used in auctions whose bid length is short, such as those for airport landing/take-off slots for example. The integer programming formulation of the WDP stipulates that a bid either loses or wins. If we relax this constraint so that bids can partially win, this corresponds to the linear relaxation of the problem and is solvable in polynomial time. At each node of the search tree we can quickly solve the linear relaxation of the remaining problem in the subtree below the current node to establish an upper bound on remaining revenue. If this upper bound plus revenue in the parent tree is less than the current lower bound on revenue, search at that node can cease. The (continuous) LP relaxation thus provides a vital speed-up in the search for weighted super solutions, which we have exploited in our implementation. The LP formulation is as follows: max xi∈V aixi 188 100 95 90 85 80 75 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 Revenue(%ofoptimum) Bids Average Repair Solution Revenue Worst-case Repair Solution Revenue (a) paths 100 95 90 85 80 75 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 Revenue(%ofoptimum) Bids Average Repair Solution Revenue Worst-case Repair Solution Revenue (b) matching 100 95 90 85 80 75 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 Revenue(%ofoptimum) Bids Average Repair Solution Revenue Worst-case Repair Solution Revenue (c) regions-npv 100 95 90 85 80 75 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 Revenue(%ofoptimum) Bids Average Repair Solution Revenue Worst-case Repair Solution Revenue (d) arbitrary-npv Figure 3: Sensitivity of bid distributions to single bid withdrawal. s.t. j|i∈Sj xj ≤ 1, ∀i ∈ {1 . . . m}, xj ≥ 0, xj ∈ R. Additional techniques, that are outlined in [25], can aid the scalability of a CP approach but our main aim in these experiments is to examine the robustness of various auction distributions and consider the tradeoff between robustness and revenue. The WSS solver we have developed is an extension of the super solution solver presented in [9, 10]. This solver is, in turn, based upon the EFC constraint solver [2]. Combinatorial auctions are easily modeled as a constraint optimization problems. We have chosen the branch-on-bids formulation because in tests it worked faster than a branch-on-items formulation for the arbitrary-npv and regions-npv distributions. All variables are binary and our search mechanism uses a reverse lexicographic value ordering heuristic. This complements our dynamic variable ordering heuristic that selects the most promising unassigned variable as the next one in the search tree. We use the product of the solution of the LP relaxation and the degree of a variable to determine the likelihood of its participation in a robust solution. High values in the LP solution are a strong indication of variables most likely to form a high revenue solution whilst the a variables degree reflects the number of other bids that overlap in terms of desired items. Bids for large numbers of items tend to be more robust, which is why we weight our robust solution search in this manner. We found this heuristic to be slightly more effective than the LP solution alone. As the number of bids in the auction increases however, there is an increase in the inherent robustness of solutions so the degree of a variable loses significance as the auction size increases. 5.3 Results Our experiments simulate three different constraints on repair solutions. The first is that no winning bids are withdrawn by the bid-taker and a repair solution must return a revenue of at least 90% of the optimal overall solution. Secondly, we relaxed the revenue constraint to 85% of optimum. Thirdly, we allowed backtracking by the bid-taker on winning bids using mutual bid bonds but maintaining the revenue constraint at 90% of optimum. Prior to finding a robust solution we solved the WDP optimally using lp_solve [3]. We then set the minimum tolerable revenue for a solution to be 90% (then 85%) of the revenue of this optimal solution. We assumed that all bids were brittle, thus a repair solution is required for every bid in the solution. Initially we assume that no backtracking was permitted on assignments of items to other winning bids given a bid withdrawal elsewhere in the solution. Table 2 shows the percentage of optimal solutions that are robust for minimum revenue constraints for repair solutions of 90% and 85% of optimal revenue. Relaxing the revenue constraint on repair solutions to 85% of the optimum revenue greatly increases the number of optimal solutions that are robust. We also conducted experiments on the same auctions in which backtracking by the bid-taker is permitted using mutual bid bonds. This significantly improves the reparability of optimal solutions whilst still maintaining repair solutions of 90% of optimum. An interesting feature of the arbitrary-npv distribution is that optimal solutions can become more brittle as the number of bids increases. The reason for this is that optimal solutions for larger auctions have more winning bids. Some of the optimal solutions for the smallest auctions with 100 bids have only one winning bidder. If this bid is withdrawn it is usually easy to find a new repair solution within 90% of the previous optimal revenue. Also, repair solutions for bids that contain a small number of items may be made difficult by the fact that a reduced number of bids cover only a subset of those items. A mitigating factor is that such bids form a smaller percentage of the revenue of the optimal solution on average. We also implemented a rule stipulating that any losing bids from 189 Table 2: Optimal Solutions that are Inherently Robust (%). #Bids Min Revenue 100 250 500 1000 2000 arbitrary-npv repair ≥ 90% 21 5 3 37 93 repair ≥ 85% 26 15 40 87 100 MBB & repair ≥ 90% 41 35 60 94 ≥ 93 regions-npv repair ≥ 90% 30 33 61 91 98 repair ≥ 85% 50 71 95 100 100 MBB & repair ≥ 90% 60 78 96 99 ≥ 98 Table 3: Occurrence of Robust Solutions (%). #Bids Min Revenue 100 250 500 1000 arbitrary-npv repair ≥ 90% 58 39 51 98 repair ≥ 85% 86 88 94 99 MBB & repair ≥ 90% 78 86 98 100 regions-npv repair ≥ 90% 61 70 97 100 repair ≥ 85% 89 99 99 100 MBB & repair ≥ 90% 83 96 100 100 a withdrawing bidder cannot participate in a repair solution. This acts as a disincentive for strategic withdrawal and was also used previously in the sensitivity analysis. In some auctions, a robust solution may not exist. Table 3 shows the percentage of auctions that support robust solutions for the arbitrary-npv and regions -npv distributions. It is clear that finding robust solutions for the former distribution is particularly difficult for auctions with 250 and 500 bids when revenue constraints are 90% of optimum. This difficulty was previously alluded to by the low percentage of optimal solutions that were robust for these auctions. Relaxing the revenue constraint helps increase the percentage of auctions in which robust solutions are achievable to 88% and 94%, respectively. This improves the reparability of all solutions thereby increasing the average revenue of the optimal robust solution. It is somewhat counterintuitive to expect a reduction in reparability of auction solutions as the number of bids increases because there tends to be an increased number of solutions above a revenue threshold in larger auctions. The MBB auction model performs very well however, and ensures that robust solutions are achievable for such inherently brittle auctions without sacrificing over 10% of optimal revenue to achieve repair solutions. Figure 4 shows the average revenue of the optimal robust solution as a percentage of the overall optimum. Repair solutions found for a WSS provide a lower bound on possible revenue following a bid withdrawal. Note that in some instances it is possible for a repair solution to have higher revenue than the original solution. When backtracking on winning bids by the bid-taker is disallowed, this can only happen when the repair solution includes two or more bids that were not in the original. Otherwise the repair bids would participate in the optimal robust solution in place of the bid that was withdrawn. A WSS guarantees minimum levels of revenue for repair solutions but this is not to say that repair solutions cannot be improved upon. It is possible to use an incremental algorithm to 100 98 96 94 92 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 Revenue(%ofoptimum) Bids Repair Revenue: Min 90% Optimal Repair Revenue: Min 85% Optimal MBB: Repair Revenue: Min 90% Optimal (a) regions-npv 100 98 96 94 92 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 Revenue(%ofoptimum) Bids Repair Revenue: Min 90% Optimal Repair Revenue: Min 85% Optimal MBB: Repair Revenue: Min 90% Optimal (b) arbitrary-npv Figure 4: Revenue of optimal robust solutions. determine an optimal repair solution following a break, whilst safe in the knowledge that in advance of any possible bid withdrawal we can establish a lower bound on the revenue of a repair. Kastner et al. have provided such an incremental ILP formulation [15]. Mutual bid bonds facilitate backtracking by the bid-taker on already assigned items. This improves the reparability of all possible solutions thus increasing the revenue of the optimal robust solution on average. Figure 4 shows the increase in revenue of robust solutions in such instances. The revenues of repair solutions are bounded by at least 90% of the optimum in our experiments thereby allowing a direct comparison with robust solutions already found using the same revenue constraint but not providing for backtracking. It is immediately obvious that such a mechanism can significantly increase revenue whilst still maintaining solution robustness. Table 4 shows the number of winning bids participating in optimal and optimal robust solutions given the three different constraints on repairing solutions listed at the beginning of this section. As the number of bids increases, more of the optimal overall solutions are robust. This leads to a convergence in the number of winning bids. The numbers in brackets are derived from the sensitivity analysis of optimal solutions that reveals the fact that almost all optimal solutions for auctions of 2000 bids are robust. We can therefore infer that the average number of winning bids in revenuemaximizing robust solutions converges towards that of the optimal overall solutions. A notable side-effect of robust solutions is that fewer bids participate in the solutions. It can be clearly seen from Table 4 that when revenue constraints on repair solutions are tight, there are fewer winning bids in the optimal robust solution on average. This is particularly pronounced for smaller auctions in both distributions. This can win benefits for the bid-taker such as reduced overheads in dealing with fewer suppliers. Although MBBs aid solution repara190 Table 4: Number of winning bids. #Bids Solution 100 250 500 1000 2000 arbitrary-npv Optimal 3.31 5.60 7.17 9.31 10.63 Repair ≥ 90% 1.40 2.18 6.10 9.03 (≈ 10.63) Repair ≥ 85% 1.65 3.81 6.78 9.31 (10.63) MBB (≥ 90%) 2.33 5.49 7.33 9.34 (≈ 10.63) regions-npv Optimal 4.34 7.05 9.10 10.67 12.76 Repair ≥ 90% 3.03 5.76 8.67 10.63 (≈ 12.76) Repair ≥ 85% 3.45 6.75 9.07 (10.67) (12.76) MBB (≥ 90%) 3.90 6.86 9.10 10.68 (≈ 12.76) bility, the number of bids in the solutions increases on average. This is to be expected because a greater fraction of these solutions are in fact optimal, as we saw in Table 2. 6. DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK Bidding strategies can become complex in non-incentive-compatible mechanisms where winner determination is no longer necessarily optimal. The perceived reparability of a bid may influence the bid amount, with reparable bids reaching a lower equilibrium point and perceived irreparable bids being more aggressive. Penalty payments for bid withdrawal also create an incentive for more aggressive bidding by providing a form of insurance against the winners curse [8]. If a winning bidders revised valuation for a set of items drops by more than the penalty for withdrawal of the bid, then it is in his best interests to forfeit the item(s) and pay the penalty. Should the auction rules state that the bid-taker will refuse to sell the items to any of the remaining bidders in the event of a withdrawal, then insurance against potential losses will stimulate more aggressive bidding. However, in our case we are seeking to repair the solution with the given bids. A side-effect of such a policy is to offset the increased aggressiveness by incentivizing reduced valuations in expectation that another bidders successful bid is withdrawn. Harstad and Rothkopf [8] examined the conditions required to ensure an equilibrium position in which bidding was at least as aggressive as if no bid withdrawal was permitted, given this countervailing incentive to under-estimate a valuation. Three major results arose from their study of bid withdrawal in a single item auction: 1. Equilibrium bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal for sufficiently small probabilities of an award to the second highest bidder in the event of a bid withdrawal; 2. Equilibrium bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal if the number of bidders is large enough; 3. For many distributions of costs and estimates, equilibrium bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal if the variability of the estimating distribution is sufficiently large. It is important that mutual bid bonds do not result in depressed bidding in equilibrium. An analysis of the resultant behavior of bidders must incorporate the possibility of a bidder winning an item and having it withdrawn in order for the bid-taker to formulate a repair solution after a break elsewhere. Harstad and Rothkopf have analyzed bidder aggressiveness [8] using a strictly game-theoretic model in which the only reason for bid withdrawal is the winners curse. They assumed all bidders were risk-neutral, but surmised that it is entirely possible for the bid-taker to collect a risk premium from risk-averse bidders with the offer of such insurance. Combinatorial auctions with mutual bid bonds add an extra incentive to bid aggressively because of the possibility of being compensated for having a winning bid withdrawn by a bid-taker. This is militated against by the increased probability of not having items withdrawn in a repair solution. We leave an in-depth analysis of the sufficient conditions for more aggressive bidding for future work. Whilst the WSS framework provides ample flexibility and expressiveness, scalability becomes a problem for larger auctions. Although solutions to larger auctions tend to be naturally more robust, some bid-takers in such auctions may require robustness. A possible extension of our work in this paper may be to examine the feasibility of reformulating integer linear programs so that the solutions are robust. Hebrard et al. [10] examined reformulation of CSPs for finding super solutions. Alternatively, it may be possible to use a top-down approach by looking at the k-best solutions sequentially, in terms of revenue, and performing sensitivity analysis upon each solution until a robust one is found. In procurement settings the principle of free disposal is often discounted and all items must be sold. This reduces the number of potential solutions and thereby reduces the reparability of each solution. The impact of such a constraint on revenue of robust solutions is also left for future work. There is another interesting direction this work may take, namely robust mechanism design. Porter et al. introduced the notion of fault tolerant mechanism design in which agents have private information regarding costs for task completion, but also their probabilities of failure [20]. When the bid-taker has combinatorial valuations for task completions it may be desirable to assign the same task to multiple agents to ensure solution robustness. It is desirable to minimize such potentially redundant task assignments but not to the detriment of completed task valuations. This problem could be modeled using the WSS framework in a similar manner to that of combinatorial auctions. In the case where no robust solutions are found, it is possible to optimize robustness, instead of revenue, by finding a solution of at least a given revenue that minimizes the probability of an irreparable break. In this manner the least brittle solution of adequate revenue may be chosen. 7. CONCLUSION Fairness is often cited as a reason for choosing the optimal solution in terms of revenue only [22]. Robust solutions militate against bids deemed brittle, therefore bidders must earn a reputation for being reliable to relax the reparability constraint attached to their bids. This may be seen as being fair to long-standing business partners whose reliability is unquestioned. Internet-based auctions are often seen as unwelcome price-gouging exercises by suppliers in many sectors [6, 17]. Traditional business partnerships are being severed by increased competition amongst suppliers. Quality of Service can suffer because of the increased focus on short-term profitability to the detriment of the bid-taker in the long-term. Robust solutions can provide a means of selectively discriminating against distrusted bidders in a measured manner. As combinatorial auction deployment moves from large value auctions with a small pool of trusted bidders (e.g. spectrum-rights sales) towards lower value auctions with potentially unknown bidders (e.g. Supply Chain Management [30]), solution robustness becomes more relevant. As well as being used to ensure that the bid-taker is not left vulnerable to bid withdrawal, it may also be used to cement relationships with preferred, possibly incumbent, suppliers. 191 We have shown that it is possible to attain robust solutions for CAs with only a small loss in revenue. We have also illustrated how such solutions tend to have fewer winning bids than overall optimal solutions, thereby reducing any overheads associated with dealing with more bidders. We have also demonstrated that introducing mutual bid bonds, a form of leveled commitment contract, can significantly increase the revenue of optimal robust solutions by improving reparability. We contend that robust solutions using such a mechanism can allow a bid-taker to offer the possibility of bid withdrawal to bidders whilst remaining confident about postrepair revenue and also facilitating increased bidder aggressiveness. 8.

En realidad, los licitadores a menudo retiran las ofertas ganadoras antes de la transacción cuando lo mejor para ellos lo es hacerlo. Dado un retiro de oferta en una subasta combinatoria, encontrar una solución de reparación alternativa de ingresos adecuados sin causar perturbaciones indebidas a las ofertas ganadoras restantes en la solución original puede ser difícil o incluso imposible. Hemos llamado a esto el problema de exposición de los tomadores de ofertas.

En este documento, proponemos un enfoque para abordar el problema de exposición de Bidtakers. En primer lugar, utilizamos el marco de Super Solutions ponderado [13], desde el campo de la programación de restricciones, para resolver el problema de encontrar una solución robusta. Una súper solución ponderada garantiza que cualquier subconjunto de ofertas que probablemente se retiren se pueden reparar para formar una nueva solución de al menos un ingreso dado al realizar cambios limitados.

Luego examinamos la compensación entre robustez y ingresos en diferentes escenarios de subasta de motivación económica para diferentes limitaciones sobre los ingresos de las soluciones de reparación. También demostramos experimentalmente que menos ofertas ganadoras participan en soluciones sólidas, reduciendo así cualquier sobrecarga asociada para tratar con postores adicionales.

Introducción Una subasta combinatoria (CA) [5] proporciona un medio eficiente para asignar múltiples elementos distinguibles entre los licitadores cuyas valoraciones percibidas para combinaciones de elementos difieren. Dichas subastas están ganando popularidad y existe una proliferación en su uso en varias industrias, como telecomunicaciones, adquisiciones y transporte B2B [11, 19]. Los ingresos son el criterio de optimización más obvio para tales subastas, pero otro atributo deseable es la robustez de la solución. En términos de subastas combinatorias, una solución robusta es una que puede soportar el retiro de ofertas (una ruptura) haciendo cambios fácilmente para formar una solución de reparación de ingresos adecuados. Una solución frágil para una CA es aquella en la que una pérdida inaceptable en los ingresos es inevitable si se retira una oferta ganadora. En tales situaciones, la oferta puede quedarse con un conjunto de elementos considerados de bajo valor por todos los demás postores. Estos licitadores pueden asociar un valor más alto para estos elementos si se combinaron con artículos ya otorgados a otros, por lo tanto, la oferta se deja en un óptimo local indeseable en el que se requiere una forma de retroceso para reasignar los elementos de una manera que resulta que resulta que resulta.en ingresos suficientes. Hemos llamado a esto el problema de exposición de los tomadores de ofertas que tiene similitudes con el problema de exposición que enfrentan los licitadores que buscan múltiples elementos en subastas separadas de una sola unidad, pero mantienen poco o ningún valor para un subconjunto de esos elementos. Sin embargo, los elementos reasignados pueden considerarse perjudiciales para una solución en muchos escenarios de la vida real. Considere un escenario donde la adquisición para un negocio se realiza utilizando una ca. Sería muy indeseable retractar los contratos de un grupo de proveedores debido al fracaso de un tercero. Es preferible una solución robusta que sea tolerante a tales descansos. La robustez puede considerarse como una medida preventiva que protege contra la incertidumbre futura al sacrificar los ingresos en lugar de la estabilidad de la solución y la reparabilidad. Suponemos un enfoque probabilístico mediante el cual la licitante tiene conocimiento de la fiabilidad de los licitadores del cual se puede inferir la probabilidad de una transacción incompleta. Se requieren soluciones de reparación para las ofertas que se consideran frágiles (es decir, es probable que se rompa). También se pueden requerir reparaciones para conjuntos de ofertas que se consideren frágiles. Proponemos el uso del marco ponderado Super 183 Solutions (WSS) [13] para la programación de restricciones, que es ideal para establecer tales soluciones sólidas. Como veremos, este marco puede imponer restricciones en las soluciones para que los posibles roturas sean reparables. Este artículo está organizado de la siguiente forma: La Sección 2 presenta el problema de determinación del ganador (WDP) para las subastas combinatorias, describe algunas posibles razones para el retiro de ofertas y muestra cómo simplemente maximizar los ingresos esperados puede conducir a pérdidas de ingresos intolerables para los tomadores de ofertas con reestima a los riesgos. Esto motiva el uso de soluciones robustas y la Sección 3 introduce un marco de programación de restricciones (CP), super soluciones ponderadas [13], que encuentra tales soluciones. Luego proponemos un modelo de subasta en la Sección 4 que mejora la reparabilidad al introducir los bonos de oferta mutua obligatorios, que pueden verse como una forma de contrato de compromiso nivelado [26, 27]. La Sección 5 presenta una extensa evaluación empírica del enfoque presentado en este documento, en el contexto de una serie de distribuciones de subasta combinatorias conocidas, con resultados muy alentadores. La Sección 6 discute posibles extensiones y preguntas planteadas por nuestra investigación que merecen trabajos futuros. Finalmente, en la Sección 7 se hacen una serie de comentarios finales.2. Subastas combinatorias Antes de presentar los detalles técnicos de nuestra solución al problema de exposición de los tomadores de ofertas, presentaremos una breve encuesta de subastas combinatorias y técnicas existentes para manejar el retiro de ofertas. Las subastas combinatorias implican un solo tomador de ofertas que asignan múltiples elementos distinguibles entre un grupo de postores. El bidtaker tiene un conjunto de m artículos para la venta, m = {1, 2 ,..., m}, y los postores presentan un conjunto de ofertas, b = {b1, b2 ,..., Bn}. Una oferta es una tupla bj = sj, pj donde sj ⊆ m es un subconjunto de los artículos para la venta y PJ ≥ 0 es un precio. El WDP para una CA es etiquetar todas las ofertas como ganar o perder para maximizar los ingresos de ganar ofertas sin asignar ningún artículo a más de una oferta. La siguiente es la formulación de programación entera para el wdp: max n j = 1 pjxj s.t.j | i∈Sj xj ≤ 1, ∀i ∈ {1...m}, xj ∈ {0, 1}. Este problema es NP-Complete [23] e inproximable [25], y también se conoce como el problema de embalaje establecido. La formulación del problema anterior asume la noción de eliminación libre. Esto significa que la solución óptima no necesita vender todos los artículos. Si las reglas de subasta estipulan que todos los elementos deben vendirse, el problema se convierte en un problema de partición establecido [5]. El WDP ha sido ampliamente estudiado en los últimos años. Los algoritmos de búsqueda más rápidos que encuentran soluciones óptimas (p. Cabob [25]) puede, en la práctica, resolver problemas muy grandes que involucran a miles de ofertas muy rápidamente.2.1 El problema del retiro de ofertas asumimos un protocolo de subasta con un proceso de tres etapas que implica la presentación de ofertas, determinación del ganador y finalmente una fase de transacción. Estamos interesados en los retiros de ofertas que ocurren entre el anuncio de las ofertas ganadoras y el final de la fase de transacción. Todas las ofertas son válidas hasta que se completa la transacción, por lo que anticipamos un proceso de transacción expediente1.1 En algunos casos, el período de transacción puede ser tan largo que la consideración de las ofertas no ganadoras que aún son válidas pueden no ser justa. Las roturas que ocurren durante una larga fase de transacción son más difíciles de remediar y pueden requerir una subasta posterior. Por ejemplo, si el artículo es un contrato de servicio por un período de tiempo determinado y la ruptura ocurre después del cumplimiento parcial de este contrato, el otro un ejemplo de un retiro de oferta ganadora ocurrió en una subasta de espectro de la FCC [32]. Los retiros o descansos pueden ocurrir por varias razones. El retiro de la oferta puede ser instigado por la oferta cuando se rompan los acuerdos de calidad de servicio o no se cumplan los plazos de pago. Nos referimos al retiro de ofertas por parte del tomador de ofertas como retiro de ítem en este documento para distinguir entre las acciones de un postor y el tomador de ofertas. Harstad y Rothkopf [8] describieron varias posibilidades para descansos en subastas de un solo artículo que incluyen: 1. Una valoración/oferta inicial errónea;2. Eventos inesperados fuera del control de licitadores ganadores;3. Un deseo de honrar la segunda mejor oferta;4. Información obtenida o eventos que ocurrieron después de la subasta, pero antes de la transacción que reduce el valor de un elemento;5. La revelación de las valoraciones de los licitadores competidores infiere la rentabilidad reducida, un problema conocido como la maldición de los ganadores. Kastner et al.[15] examinó cómo manejar perturbaciones dada una solución al tiempo que minimiza los cambios necesarios en esa solución. Estas perturbaciones pueden incluir retiros de oferta, cambio de valoración/elementos de una oferta o la presentación de una nueva oferta. Observaron el problema de encontrar soluciones incrementales para reestructurar una cadena de suministro cuya formación se determina utilizando subastas combinatorias [30]. Después de una perturbación en la solución óptima, proceden a imponer retiros de artículos involuntarios de los licitadores ganadores. Formularon un programa lineal entero incremental (ILP) que buscaba maximizar la valoración de la solución de reparación al tiempo que preservaba la solución anterior tanto como sea posible.2.2 Ser proactivo contra el retiro de la oferta Cuando se retira una oferta, puede haber limitaciones sobre cómo se puede reparar la solución. Si el tomador de ofertas pudo revocar libremente la adjudicación de elementos a otros postores, entonces la solución podría repararse fácilmente reasignando todos los elementos a la solución óptima sin la oferta retirada. Alternativamente, el postor que incumplió una oferta puede tener todas sus otras ofertas descalificadas y los elementos podrían reasignarse en función de la solución óptima sin ese postor presente. Sin embargo, el tomador de ofertas a menudo no puede reasignar libremente los artículos ya otorgados a otros postores. Cuando los artículos no se pueden retirar de los postores ganadores, luego del fracaso de otro postor para honrar su oferta, las soluciones de reparación están restringidas al conjunto de ofertas cuyos artículos solo incluyen a las de las ofertas que se incumplieron. Somos libres de otorgar elementos a cualquiera de las ofertas previamente fallidas al encontrar una solución de reparación. Cuando se enfrenta a la incertidumbre sobre la confiabilidad de los postores, un posible enfoque es maximizar los ingresos esperados. Este enfoque no tiene en cuenta las ofertas que reacios al riesgo que pueden ver una pequeña posibilidad de ingresos muy bajos como inaceptables. Considere el ejemplo en la Tabla 1, y los ingresos esperados óptimos en la situación en la que se puede retirar una sola oferta. Hay tres ofertas presentadas para los artículos A y B, el tercero es una oferta combinada para el par de elementos con un valor de 190. La solución óptima tiene un valor de 200, con la primera y segunda oferta como ganadores. Cuando consideramos las probabilidades de falla, en la cuarta columna, el problema del problema de la solución para elegir se vuelve más difícil. Calcular los ingresos esperados para la solución con la primera y segunda oferta ganando los artículos, denotado 1, 1, 0, da: (200 × 0.9 × 0.9)+(2 × 100 × 0.9 × 0.1)+(190 × 0.1 × 0.1) = 181.90.Las valoraciones de los postores para el artículo pueden haber disminuido de manera no lineal.184 Tabla 1: Subasta combinatoria de ejemplo. Ítems ofertas a b ab abstidación prob x1 100 0 0 0 0.1 x2 0 100 0 0.1 x3 0 0 190 0.1 Si se retira una sola oferta, hay probabilidad de 0.18 de un ingreso de 100, dado el hecho de que no podemos retirar un artículo del otroLicitante ganador. El ingreso esperado para 0, 0, 1 es: (190 × 0.9) + (200 × 0.1) = 191.00. Por lo tanto, podemos suponer que la segunda solución es preferible a la primera basada en los ingresos esperados. Sin embargo, determinar los ingresos máximos esperados en presencia de dicha incertidumbre se vuelve computacionalmente inviable, a medida que crece el número de ofertas frágiles. Se debe resolver un WDP para todas las combinaciones posibles de ofertas que puedan fallar. La posible pérdida de ingresos para descansos tampoco está bien limitado utilizando este enfoque, por lo tanto, una gran pérdida puede ser posible para un pequeño número de descansos. Considere el ejemplo anterior donde el monto de la oferta para X3 se convierte en 175. Los ingresos esperados de 1, 1, 0 (181.75) se vuelven mayores que el de 0, 0, 1 (177.50). Hay algunos de los tomadores de ofertas que pueden preferir la última solución porque los ingresos nunca son inferiores a 175, pero la anterior solución devuelve ingresos de solo 100 con probabilidad 0.18. Una oferta de reestructuración de riesgos no puede tolerar tal posibilidad, prefiriendo sacrificar los ingresos por un riesgo reducido. Si modificamos nuestra búsqueda de reparación para que se garantice una solución de al menos un ingreso dado, la búsqueda de una solución de reparación se convierte en una prueba de satisfacción en lugar de un problema de optimización. Los enfoques descritos anteriormente están en contraste con lo que proponemos en la siguiente sección. Nuestro enfoque puede verse como preventivo, ya que encontramos una asignación inicial de elementos a los postores que es robusto al retiro de ofertas. Las posibles pérdidas en los ingresos están limitadas por un porcentaje fijo de la verdadera asignación óptima. Las perturbaciones a la solución original también son limitadas para minimizar la interrupción. Consideramos esto como el enfoque ideal para las subastas combinatorias del mundo real. Definición 1 (solución robusta para una CA). Una solución robusta para una subasta combinatoria es una en la que cualquier subconjunto de ofertas exitosas cuya probabilidad de retiro sea mayor o igual a α puede repararse reasignando elementos a un costo de la mayoría de los β a otras ofertas previamente perdidas para formar una solución de reparación. Restricciones sobre ingresos aceptables, p.Al ser un porcentaje mínimo de lo óptimo, se definen en el modelo problemático y, por lo tanto, se satisfacen por todas las soluciones. El costo máximo de reparación, β, puede ser un valor fijo que puede considerarse como un fondo para compensar a los licitadores ganadores cuyos artículos se retiran de ellos al crear una solución de reparación. Alternativamente, β puede ser una función de las ofertas que fueron retiradas. La Sección 4 dará un ejemplo de tal mecanismo. En la siguiente sección describimos un marco ideal basado en restricciones para el establecimiento de soluciones tales sólidas.3. Encontrar soluciones robustas en la programación de restricciones [4] (CP), un problema de satisfacción de restricción (CSP) se modela como un conjunto de n variables x = {x1 ,..., xn}, un conjunto de dominios d = {d (x1) ,..., D (xn)}, donde d (xi) es el conjunto de valores finitos posibles para la variable xi y un conjunto c = {c1 ,..., Cm} de restricciones, cada una restringiendo las asignaciones de algún subconjunto de las variables en X. La satisfacción de la restricción implica encontrar valores para cada una de las variables de problemas de modo que se cumplan todas las restricciones. Sus principales ventajas son su naturaleza declarativa y flexibilidad para abordar los problemas con limitaciones laterales arbitrarias. La optimización de restricciones busca encontrar una solución a un CSP que optimice alguna función objetivo. Una técnica común para resolver problemas de optimización de restricciones es utilizar técnicas de ramificación y unión que eviten explorar subarres que se sabe que no contienen una mejor solución que la mejor encontrada hasta ahora. Un límite inicial se puede determinar al encontrar una solución que satisfaga todas las restricciones en C o mediante el uso de algunos métodos heurísticos. Una súper solución clásica (SS) es una solución a un CSP en la que, si un pequeño número de variables pierde sus valores, las soluciones de reparación están garantizadas con solo unos pocos cambios, proporcionando así la solidez de la solución [9, 10]. Es una generalización de la tolerancia a fallas en CP [31] y supermodelos en satisfilidad proposicional (SAT) [7]. Una solución (A, B)-Super es aquella en la que, si como máximo, una variables pierde sus valores, se puede encontrar una solución de reparación cambiando como máximo B otras variables [10]. Las súper soluciones para subastas combinatorias minimizan el número de ofertas cuyo estado debe cambiarse al formar una solución de reparación [12]. Solo un conjunto particular de variables en la solución puede estar sujeto a cambios y se dice que son miembros del breakset. Para cada combinación de tareas frágiles en el conjunto de interrupciones, se requiere un conjunto de reparación que comprenda el conjunto de variables cuyos valores deben cambiar para proporcionar otra solución. La cardinalidad del conjunto de reparación se utiliza para medir el costo de la reparación. En realidad, cambiar algunas tareas variables en una solución de reparación incurre en un costo más bajo que otras, lo que motiva el uso de una métrica diferente para determinar la legalidad de los conjuntos de reparación. El marco de Super Solution ponderado (WSS) [13] considera el costo de reparación requerido, en lugar de simplemente el número de tareas modificadas, para formar una solución alternativa. Para CAS, esto puede ser una medida de las sanciones de compensación pagadas a los licitadores ganadores para romper los acuerdos existentes. Las soluciones sólidas son particularmente deseables para las aplicaciones donde la falta de fiabilidad es un problema y las posibles roturas pueden incurrir en sanciones severas. Las súper soluciones ponderadas ofrecen un medio para expresar qué variables se vuelven a asignar fácilmente y aquellas que incurren en un costo pesado [13]. Hebrard et al.[9] Describa cómo pueden fallar algunas variables (como las máquinas en un problema de la tienda de empleo) y otras no. Un WSS generaliza este enfoque para que haya una probabilidad de falla asociada con cada asignación y conjuntos de variables cuyas asignaciones tienen probabilidades de falla mayor o igual a un valor umbral, α, requieren soluciones de reparación. Un WSS mide el costo de reparación o reasignación de otras variables que usan inercia como métrica. La inercia es una medida de una aversión de variables para cambiar y depende de su asignación actual, asignación futura y las variables de rotura. Puede ser deseable reasignar elementos a diferentes postores para encontrar una solución de reparación de ingresos satisfactorios. Es posible que la compensación tenga que pagarse a los postores que pierden artículos durante la formación de una solución de reparación. La inercia de una oferta refleja el costo de cambiar su estado. Para las ofertas ganadoras, esto puede reflejar la multa de compensación necesaria para que el tomador de ofertas rompa el acuerdo (si se permiten dichas infracciones), mientras que para perder las ofertas previamente es una operación libre. El monto total de compensación pagadera para los postores puede depender de otros factores, como la causa de la ruptura. Existe un límite de cuánto deberían ser estos costos generales de reparación, y esto está dado por el valor β. Este valor no puede conocerse de antemano y 185 algoritmo 1: WSS (nivel int, doble α, doble β): boolean begins si nivel> número de variables luego devuelve verdadero elige variable no asignada x foreach valor v en el dominio de x asignarx: v Si el problema es consistente, entonces foreach combinación de tareas frágiles, un hacer si ¬ reparable (a, β) entonces regresa falso;Si WSS (nivel+1), entonces return True UnSign x return False Fin puede depender de la ruptura. Por lo tanto, β puede verse como el Fondo utilizado para compensar a los postores ganadores por el retiro unilateral de sus ofertas por parte de la oferta. En resumen, un (α, β) -WSS permite cualquier conjunto de variables cuya probabilidad de romper es mayor o igual que α se repare con cambios en la solución robusta original con un costo de la mayoría de β. La búsqueda de profundidad primero de un WSS (ver Descripción del código de pseudo en el algoritmo 1) mantiene la consistencia de arco [24] en cada nodo del árbol. A medida que avanza la búsqueda, la reparabilidad de cada asignación anterior se verifica en cada nodo extendiendo una solución de reparación parcial a la misma profundidad que la solución parcial actual. Se puede considerar que esto mantiene los árboles de búsqueda concurrentes para reparaciones. Se proporciona una solución de reparación para cada conjunto posible de variables de descanso, A. El algoritmo WSS intenta extender la asignación parcial actual eligiendo una variable y asignándolo un valor. El retroceso puede ocurrir por una de dos razones: no podemos extender la asignación para satisfacer las restricciones dadas, o la asignación parcial actual no puede asociarse con una solución de reparación cuyo costo de reparación es menor que β en caso de que ocurra una ruptura. El procedimiento reparable busca soluciones de reparación parcial utilizando retroceso e intentos de extender la última reparación encontrada, al igual que en (1, b) super soluciones [9];Las diferencias son que se proporciona una reparación para un conjunto de variables de rotura en lugar de una sola variable y se considera el costo de reparación. Se utiliza un operador de suma para determinar el costo total de la reparación. Si se puede formar un límite fijo sobre el tamaño de cualquier conjunto de interrupción potencial, el algoritmo WSS es NPComplete. Para una descripción más detallada del algoritmo de búsqueda WSS, se hace referencia al lector [13], ya que una descripción completa del algoritmo está más allá del alcance de este documento. EJEMPLO 1. Pasaremos el ejemplo dado en la Tabla 1 al buscar un WSS. Cada oferta está representada por una sola variable con valores de dominio de 0 y 1, el primero que representa la oferta de oferta y el último éxito de ofertas. La probabilidad de falla de las variables es 0.1 cuando se asignan a 1 y 0.0 de lo contrario. El problema se resuelve inicialmente utilizando un solucionador ILP como LP_SOLVE [3] o CPLEX, y se encuentra que los ingresos óptimos son 200. Un porcentaje fijo de este ingreso se puede utilizar como un valor umbral para una solución sólida y sus reparaciones. La oferta desea tener una solución robusta para que si se retira una sola oferta ganadora, se puede formar una solución de reparación sin retirar los artículos de cualquier otro postor ganador. Este ejemplo puede verse como una búsqueda de una súper solución ponderada (0.1,0), β es 0 porque no hay fondos disponibles para compensar el retiro de artículos de los licitadores ganadores. El tomador de ofertas está dispuesto a comprometerse con los ingresos, pero solo en un 5%, por ejemplo, sobre el valor óptimo. Las ofertas 1 y 3 no pueden tener éxito, ya que ambas requieren el artículo A, por lo que se agrega una restricción que excluye la asignación en la que ambas variables toman el valor 1. Del mismo modo, las ofertas 2 y 3 no pueden ganar, por lo que se agrega otra restricción entre estas dos variables. Por lo tanto, en este ejemplo, el conjunto de variables CSP es V = {x1, x2, x3}, cuyos dominios son todos {0, 1}. Las restricciones son x1 + x3 ≤ 1, x2 + x3 ≤ 1 y xi∈V aixi ≥ 190, donde AI refleja las cuentas relevantes para las variables de oferta respectivas. Para encontrar una solución robusta de ingresos óptimos, buscamos maximizar la suma de estas cantidades, max xi∈V aixi. Cuando todas las variables se establecen en 0 (ver Figura 1 (a) Rama 3), esta no es una solución porque el ingreso mínimo de 190 no se ha cumplido, por lo que intentamos asignar BID3 a 1 (Rama 4). Esta es una solución válida, pero esta variable es frágil porque hay un 10% de posibilidades de que esta oferta se retire (ver Tabla 1). Por lo tanto, debemos determinar si se puede formar una reparación si se rompe. La búsqueda de una reparación comienza en el primer nodo, ver Figura 1 (b). Observe que el valor 1 se ha eliminado de BID3 porque este árbol de búsqueda está simulando el retiro de esta oferta. Cuando BID1 se establece en 0 (Branch 4.1), la solución de ingresos máximo en el subárbol restante tiene ingresos de solo 100, por lo tanto, la búsqueda se suspende en ese nodo del árbol. BID1 y BID2 se asignan a 1 (ramas 4.2 y 4.4) y el costo total de ambos cambios sigue siendo 0 porque no se debe pagar una compensación por las ofertas que cambian de perder a la ganancia. Con Bid3 ahora perdiendo (Rama 4.5), esto proporciona una solución de reparación de 200. Por lo tanto, 0, 0, 1 es reparable y, por lo tanto, un WSS. Sin embargo, continuamos nuestra búsqueda en la Figura 1 (a), porque estamos buscando una solución sólida de ingresos óptimos. Cuando BID1 se asigna a 1 (Rama 6), buscamos una reparación parcial para esta ruptura variable (la rama 5 no se considera, ya que ofrece ingresos insuficientes). La búsqueda de reparación establece BID1 a 0 en un árbol de búsqueda separado (no se muestra), y el control se devuelve a la búsqueda de un WSS. BID2 se establece en 0 (Branch 7), pero esta solución no produciría ingresos suficientes para que BID2 se establezca en 1 (Branch 8). Luego intentamos extender la reparación de BID1 (no se muestra). Esto falla porque la reparación para BID1 no puede asignar BID2 a 0 porque el costo de reparar dicha tarea sería ∞, dado que las reglas de subasta no permiten que el retiro de artículos gane ofertas ganadoras. Por lo tanto, una reparación para Bid1 ruptura no es posible porque los artículos ya se han otorgado a Bid2. Una solución de reparación con BID2 asignada a 1 no produce ingresos suficientes cuando BID1 se asigna a 0. La incapacidad de retirar elementos de las ofertas ganadoras implica que 1, 1, 0 es una solución irreparable cuando el ingreso mínimo tolerable es mayor que 100. Los comentarios en cursiva y la línea discontinua en la Figura 1 (a) ilustran la ruta de búsqueda de un WSS si ambas ofertas se consideraban reparables. La Sección 4 presenta un modelo de subasta alternativa que permitirá al tomador de ofertas recibir una compensación por roturas y, a su vez, utilizar este pago para compensar a otros licitadores por retirar los artículos de las ofertas ganadoras. Esto permitirá la reasignación de elementos y permitirá el establecimiento de 1, 1, 0 como segundo WSS para este ejemplo.4. Bonos de oferta mutua: un mecanismo de retroceso algunas soluciones de subastas son inherentemente frágiles y puede ser imposible encontrar una solución robusta. Si podemos alterar las reglas de una subasta para que la oferta pueda retraer elementos de los postores ganadores, entonces la reparabilidad de las soluciones a tales subastas puede mejorarse. En esta sección proponemos un modelo de subasta que permite la oferta y el retiro de ítems por parte de los licitadores y ofertas, respectivamente. Proponemos un modelo que incorpora bonos de oferta mutua para permitir la reparabilidad de la solución para el tomador de ofertas, una forma de seguro contra 186 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Insuficiente Ingresos Encuentre una solución de reparación para la oferta 3 Encuentra parcialReparación para la oferta 1 Ruptura Ingresos insuficientes (a) Extienda la reparación parcial para la oferta 1 Ruptura (b) Encuentre la reparación parcial para la oferta 2 Oficina de rotura 1 BID 2 BID 3 Encuentre soluciones de reparación para la oferta 1 y 2 rotos [0] [190] [100] [100] [200] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Ingresos insuficientes (a) Buscar WSS.0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 Ingresos insuficientes Insuficientes Ingresos Oferta 1 Oferta 2 Oferta 3 Inercia = 0 Inertia = 0 Inertia = 0 4.1 4.2 4.3 4.4 4.5 (b) Busque una reparación para la oferta 3 de rotura. Figura 1: Busque el árbol de un WSS sin retirada del artículo.Los ganadores maldecirán al postor mientras también compensan a los postores en el caso de retiro de artículos de las ofertas ganadoras. Proponemos que dichos ganadores maldicen el seguro de exposición de los consejos y las ofertas comprendan un porcentaje fijo, κ, del monto de la oferta para todas las ofertas. Dichos bonos de oferta mutua son obligatorios para cada oferta en nuestro Modelo2. Las condiciones adjuntas a los bonos de oferta son que se permite que la oferta anule las ofertas ganadoras (retiro de artículos) al reparar los descansos en otra parte de la solución. En interés de la justicia, la compensación se paga a los licitadores de quienes se retiran los artículos y es equivalente a la multa que se habría impuesto al licitador si ha retirado la oferta. Las subastas combinatorias imponen una pesada carga computacional al postor, por lo que es importante que la cobertura de riesgo sea una operación simple y transparente para el postor para no aumentar aún más esta carga innecesariamente. También sostenemos que es imperativo que el postor conozca la posible multa por retiro antes de la presentación de la oferta. Esta información es esencial para los postores al determinar cuán agresivos deben ser en su estrategia de licitación. Los bonos de oferta son comunes en la adquisición para proyectos de construcción. Por lo general, son obligatorios para todas las ofertas, son un porcentaje fijo, κ, del monto de la oferta y son unidireccionales, ya que el retiro del artículo no está permitido. Los bonos de oferta mutua pueden verse como una forma de contrato de compromiso nivelado en el que ambas partes pueden romper el contrato por la misma multa fija. Dichos contratos permiten la eliminación unilateral por las sanciones presagificadas. Sandholm et al.demostró que esto puede aumentar los pagos esperados de todas las partes y permite acuerdos que serían imposibles bajo compromiso total [26, 28, 29]. En la práctica, un bono de oferta generalmente oscila entre el 5 y el 20% de los 2 que hace que el seguro sea opcional puede ser beneficioso en algunos casos. Si un postor no acepta el seguro, se puede inferir que puede haber determinado con precisión la valoración de los artículos y, por lo tanto, es menos probable que sea víctima de la maldición de los ganadores. La probabilidad de que tal oferta se retire puede ser menor, por lo que una solución de reparación puede considerarse innecesaria para esta oferta. Por otro lado, disminuye la reparabilidad de las soluciones.Monto de oferta [14, 18]. Si las penalizaciones de desmontaje son las mismas para ambas partes en todas las ofertas, κ no influye en la reparabilidad de un conjunto dado de ofertas. Simplemente influye en los niveles de sanciones y compensación transactas por los agentes. Valores bajos de κ incurren en sanciones de retiro de oferta bajas y simulan una oferta dictatorial que no compensa adecuadamente a los postores por el retiro de artículos. Andersson y Sandholm [1] encontraron que los agentes miopes alcanzan un bienestar social más alto más rápido si actúan egoístamente en lugar de cooperativamente cuando las sanciones en los contratos de compromiso nivelados son bajos. Es probable que el aumento de los niveles de retiro de ofertas sea cuando las sanciones también son bajas. Los valores altos de κ tienden a comprometerse con total y reducen las ventajas de tales ganadores, maldecir el seguro de exposición de los taqueros y los bichos. Las sanciones pagadas se utilizan para financiar una reasignación de elementos para formar una solución de reparación de ingresos suficientes al compensar a los postores previamente exitosos por retiro de los artículos de ellos. Ejemplo 2. Considere el ejemplo dado en la Tabla 1 una vez más, donde las ofertas también comprenden un bono de oferta mutua del 5% del monto de la oferta. Si se retira una oferta, el licitador pierde esta cantidad y la oferta puede compensar a los licitadores ganadores cuyos artículos se retiran al tratar de formar una solución de reparación más adelante. La búsqueda de soluciones de reparación para descansos a Bid1 y Bid2 aparece en las Figuras 2 (A) y 2 (b), respectivamente 3. Cuando Bid1 se rompe, hay una multa de compensación pagada al tomador de ofertas igual a 5 que se puede utilizar para financiar una reasignación de los artículos. Por lo tanto, establecemos β a 5 y esto se convierte en el gasto máximo permitido para retirar artículos de los postores ganadores.β también se puede ver como el tamaño del fondo disponible para facilitar el retroceso del tomador de la oferta. Cuando extendemos la reparación parcial para BID1 para que Bid2 pierda un artículo (Rama 8.1), el costo total de la reparación aumenta a 5, debido a este retiro de elemento por parte del tomador de ofertas, 3 La implementación real de WSS verifica soluciones anteriores a las soluciones anteriores a las soluciones anteriores aVea si pueden reparar descansos antes de buscar una nueva solución de reparación.0, 0, 1 es una solución que ya se ha encontrado, por lo que la búsqueda de una reparación en este ejemplo no es estrictamente necesaria, pero se describe por razones pedagógicas.187 0 0 0 1 1 Bid 1 Bid 2 Bid 3 Inertia de ingresos insuficientes = 5 = 5 Inercia = 0 = 5 Inercia = 5 = 5 1 6.1 8.1 9.1 9.2 (a) Busque una reparación para la rotura de la oferta 1.0 0 0 1 1 BID 1 BID 2 BID 3 Ingresos insuficientes Inercia = 10 = 10 Inercia = 10 = 10 Inercia = 10 = 10 1 8.2 8.3 9.3 9.4 (b) Busque una reparación para la rotura de la oferta 2. Figura 2: Reparar el árbol de búsqueda para los descansos 1 y 2, κ = 0.05.y está solo dentro del límite dado por β. En la Figura 1 (a), la ruta de búsqueda sigue la línea discontinua y establece que Bid3 sea 0 (Rama 9). Las soluciones de reparación para las ofertas 1 y 2 se pueden extender aún más asignando BID3 a 1 (ramas 9.2 y 9.4). Por lo tanto, 1, 1, 0 puede considerarse una solución robusta. Recuerde que anteriormente este no era el caso. El uso de bonos de oferta mutua aumenta la reparabilidad y permite una solución sólida de los ingresos 200 en lugar de 190, como era el caso anteriormente.5. Experimentos Hemos utilizado el conjunto de pruebas de subastas combinatorias (CATS) [16] para generar datos de subastas de muestra. Generamos 100 casos de problemas en los que hay 20 artículos a la venta y 100-2000 ofertas que pueden estar dominadas en algunos casos4. Dichas ofertas dominadas pueden participar en soluciones de reparación, aunque no aparecen en soluciones óptimas. CATS utiliza patrones de licitación de motivación económica para generar datos de subastas en varios escenarios. Para motivar la investigación presentada en este documento, utilizamos el análisis de sensibilidad para examinar la fragilidad de las soluciones óptimas y, por lo tanto, determinar los tipos de subastas que tienen más probabilidades de beneficiarse de una solución robusta. Luego establecemos soluciones robustas para CAS utilizando el marco WSS.5.1 Análisis de sensibilidad para el WDP Hemos realizado un análisis de sensibilidad de las siguientes cuatro distribuciones: ranuras de despegue/aterrizaje del aeropuerto (coincidencia), componentes electrónicos (arbitrarios), propiedad/espectro (regiones) y transporte (rutas). Estas distribuciones se eligieron porque describen una amplia gama de patrones de licitación en diferentes dominios de aplicación. El método utilizado es el siguiente. En primer lugar, determinamos la solución óptima utilizando LP_SOLVE, un solucionador de programa lineal de enteros mixtos [3]. Luego simulamos un solo retiro de oferta y volvimos a resolver el problema con las otras ofertas ganadoras que quedaban fijas, es decir, no hubo abandonos involuntarios. Luego se determinó la solución de reparación óptima. Este proceso se repite para todas las ofertas ganadoras en la solución óptima general, suponiendo que todas las ofertas son frágiles. La Figura 3 muestra el ingreso promedio de tales soluciones de reparación como un porcentaje del óptimo. También se muestra el escenario promedio del peor de los casos en más de 100 subastas. También implementamos una regla de subasta que no permite las ofertas del postor renegado participando en una reparación5. La Figura 3 (a) ilustra cómo la distribución de rutas es inherentemente la distribución más sólida, ya que cuando se retira cualquier oferta ganadora, la solución se puede reparar para lograr más del 98.5% de los 4 indicadores de los Cats incluidos los precios INT con el parámetro Alfa establecido a 1000. 5 Asumimos que todas las ofertas en una oferta XOR dada con el mismo artículo ficticio eran del mismo postor.Ingresos óptimos en promedio para subastas con más de 250 ofertas. Sin embargo, hay algunos casos cuando tales retiros dan como resultado soluciones cuyos ingresos son significativamente más bajos que óptimos. Incluso en subastas con hasta 2000 ofertas, hay ocasiones en que un solo retiro de ofertas puede resultar en una caída en los ingresos de más del 5%, aunque la caída promedio de los ingresos es solo del 1%. La Figura 3 (b) muestra cómo la distribución coincidente es más frágil en promedio que los caminos y también tiene un ingreso inferior en el peor de los casos en promedio. Esta tendencia continúa a medida que las distribuciones de Regions-NPV (Figura 3 (c)) y NPV arbitraria (Figura 3 (d)) son más frágiles aún más frágiles. Estas distribuciones son claramente sensibles al retiro de ofertas cuando el tomador de ofertas puede retirar involuntariamente no otras ofertas ganadoras en la solución.5.2 Soluciones robustas que usan WSS en esta sección Nos centramos tanto en las distribuciones arbitrarias de NPV y regiones-NPV porque el análisis de sensibilidad indicó que este tipo de subastas producen soluciones óptimas que tienden a ser más frágiles y, por lo tanto, se beneficiarán más de la robustez de la solución.. Ignoramos las subastas con 2000 ofertas porque el análisis de sensibilidad ha indicado que estas subastas son inherentemente sólidas con una caída promedio muy baja en los ingresos después de un retiro de ofertas. También serían muy costosos computacionalmente, dada la complejidad adicional de encontrar soluciones sólidas. Un enfoque de CP puro debe aumentar con limitaciones globales que incorporen técnicas de investigación de operaciones para aumentar la poda lo suficiente para que se puedan examinar miles de ofertas. Las restricciones globales explotan algoritmos de filtrado de uso especial para mejorar el rendimiento [21]. Hay varias formas de acelerar la búsqueda de una superpuesta ponderada en una CA, aunque este no es el foco principal de nuestro trabajo actual. Los algoritmos de correspondencia polinomial se pueden usar en subastas cuya longitud de oferta es corta, como los de las ranuras de aterrizaje/despegue del aeropuerto, por ejemplo. La formulación de programación entera del WDP estipula que una oferta pierde o gana. Si relajamos esta restricción para que las ofertas puedan ganar parcialmente, esto corresponde a la relajación lineal del problema y se puede solucionar en el tiempo polinomial. En cada nodo del árbol de búsqueda podemos resolver rápidamente la relajación lineal del problema restante en el subárbol debajo del nodo actual para establecer un límite superior en los ingresos restantes. Si este límite superior más los ingresos en el árbol principal es menor que el límite inferior actual en los ingresos, la búsqueda en ese nodo puede cesar. La relajación LP (continua) proporciona una aceleración vital en la búsqueda de super soluciones ponderadas, que hemos explotado en nuestra implementación.

Técnicas adicionales, que se describen en [25], pueden ayudar a la escalabilidad de un enfoque de CP, pero nuestro objetivo principal en estos experimentos es examinar la robustez de varias distribuciones de subastas y considerar la compensación de la compensaciónentre robustez e ingresos. El solucionador WSS que hemos desarrollado es una extensión del solucionador de súper soluciones presentado en [9, 10]. Este solucionador se basa, a su vez, en el solucionador de restricciones EFC [2]. Las subastas combinatorias se modelan fácilmente como problemas de optimización de restricciones. Hemos elegido la formulación de sucursales de los bids porque en las pruebas funcionó más rápido que una formulación de sucursales para las distribuciones arbitrarias de NPV y regiones-NPV. Todas las variables son binarias y nuestro mecanismo de búsqueda utiliza una heurística de pedido de valor lexicográfico inverso. Esto complementa nuestra hurina de orden de variable dinámica que selecciona la variable no asignada más prometedora como la siguiente en el árbol de búsqueda. Utilizamos el producto de la solución de la relajación de LP y el grado de una variable para determinar la probabilidad de su participación en una solución robusta. Los valores altos en la solución LP son una fuerte indicación de variables que tienen más probabilidades de formar una solución de ingresos altos, mientras que el grado de variables A refleja el número de otras ofertas que se superponen en términos de los elementos deseados. Las ofertas para un gran número de elementos tienden a ser más robustos, por lo que peso de esta manera robusta de soluciones de esta manera. Encontramos que esta heurística es un poco más efectiva que la solución LP sola. Sin embargo, a medida que aumenta el número de ofertas en la subasta, hay un aumento en la robustez inherente de las soluciones, por lo que el grado de una variable pierde significado a medida que aumenta el tamaño de la subasta.5.3 Resultados Nuestros experimentos simulan tres restricciones diferentes en soluciones de reparación. La primera es que el tomador de ofertas no retira las ofertas ganadoras y una solución de reparación debe devolver un ingreso de al menos el 90% de la solución general óptima. En segundo lugar, relajamos la restricción de ingresos al 85% de Optimum. En tercer lugar, permitimos el retroceso de la oferta de las ofertas ganadoras utilizando bonos de ofertas mutuas, pero manteniendo la restricción de ingresos al 90% de Optimum. Antes de encontrar una solución robusta, resolvimos el WDP de manera óptima usando LP_SOLVE [3]. Luego establecemos los ingresos mínimos tolerables para que una solución sea 90% (entonces 85%) de los ingresos de esta solución óptima. Asumimos que todas las ofertas fueron frágiles, por lo que se requiere una solución de reparación para cada oferta de la solución. Inicialmente, suponemos que no se permitió ningún retroceso sobre las tareas de los elementos a otras ofertas ganadoras que dan un retiro de ofertas en otra parte de la solución. La Tabla 2 muestra el porcentaje de soluciones óptimas que son sólidas para las limitaciones mínimas de ingresos para soluciones de reparación del 90% y el 85% de los ingresos óptimos. La relajación de la restricción de ingresos en las soluciones de reparación al 85% de los ingresos óptimos aumenta en gran medida el número de soluciones óptimas que son robustas. También realizamos experimentos sobre las mismas subastas en las que se permite el retroceso del tomador de ofertas utilizando bonos de oferta mutua. Esto mejora significativamente la reparabilidad de soluciones óptimas al tiempo que mantiene soluciones de reparación del 90% de óptimo. Una característica interesante de la distribución arbitraria de NPV es que las soluciones óptimas pueden volverse más frágiles a medida que aumenta el número de ofertas. La razón de esto es que las soluciones óptimas para subastas más grandes tienen más ofertas ganadoras. Algunas de las soluciones óptimas para las subastas más pequeñas con 100 ofertas tienen solo un postor ganador. Si se retira esta oferta, generalmente es fácil encontrar una nueva solución de reparación dentro del 90% de los ingresos óptimos anteriores. Además, las soluciones de reparación para ofertas que contienen un pequeño número de artículos pueden ser difíciles por el hecho de que un número reducido de ofertas cubre solo un subconjunto de esos artículos. Un factor de mitigación es que tales ofertas forman un porcentaje menor de los ingresos de la solución óptima en promedio. También implementamos una regla que estipula que cualquier oferta perdedora de 189 Tabla 2: soluciones óptimas que son inherentemente robustas (%).#Bids mínimos ingresos 100 250 500 1000 2000 Arbitrary-NPV Repair ≥ 90% 21 5 3 3 37 93 Reparación ≥ 85% 26 15 40 87 100 Mbb y reparación ≥ 90% 41 35 60 94 ≥ 93 REPARACIÓN DEL NPV ≥ 90% 30 30% 30 30% 3033 61 91 98 Reparación ≥ 85% 50 71 95 100 100 Mbb y reparación ≥ 90% 60 78 96 99 ≥ 98 Tabla 3: Ocurrencia de soluciones robustas (%).#Bids min ingresos 100 250 500 1000 Arbitrary-NPV Repair ≥ 90% 58 39 51 98 Reparación ≥ 85% 86 88 94 99 MBB y Reparación ≥ 90% 78 86 98 100 REPORCIONES DE NPV ≥ 90% 61 70 97 100 REPARACIÓN ≥ ≥ ≥85% 89 99 99 100 MBB y reparación ≥ 90% 83 96 100 100 100 Un postor retirado no puede participar en una solución de reparación. Esto actúa como un desincentivo para la retirada estratégica y también se usó previamente en el análisis de sensibilidad. En algunas subastas, puede no existir una solución robusta. La Tabla 3 muestra el porcentaje de subastas que admiten soluciones robustas para las distribuciones arbitrarias de NPV y regiones -NPV. Está claro que encontrar soluciones sólidas para la distribución anterior es particularmente difícil para las subastas con 250 y 500 ofertas cuando las limitaciones de ingresos son del 90% de óptima. Esta dificultad fue aludida previamente por el bajo porcentaje de soluciones óptimas que eran robustas para estas subastas. La relajación de la restricción de ingresos ayuda a aumentar el porcentaje de subastas en las que las soluciones sólidas se pueden lograr al 88% y un 94%, respectivamente. Esto mejora la reparabilidad de todas las soluciones, aumentando así los ingresos promedio de la solución sólida óptima. Es algo contradictorio esperar una reducción en la reparabilidad de las soluciones de subastas a medida que aumenta el número de ofertas porque tiende a haber un mayor número de soluciones por encima de un umbral de ingresos en subastas más grandes. Sin embargo, el modelo de subastas MBB funciona muy bien y asegura que las soluciones robustas sean alcanzables para tales subastas inherentemente frágiles sin sacrificar más del 10% de los ingresos óptimos para lograr soluciones de reparación. La Figura 4 muestra el ingreso promedio de la solución sólida óptima como un porcentaje del óptimo general. Las soluciones de reparación encontradas para un WSS proporcionan un límite más bajo en posibles ingresos después de un retiro de oferta. Tenga en cuenta que en algunos casos es posible que una solución de reparación tenga mayores ingresos que la solución original. Cuando el retroceso de las ofertas ganadoras por parte del tomador se nota, esto solo puede suceder cuando la solución de reparación incluye dos o más ofertas que no estaban en el original. De lo contrario, las ofertas de reparación participarían en la solución sólida óptima en lugar de la oferta que fue retirada. Un WSS garantiza niveles mínimos de ingresos para soluciones de reparación, pero esto no quiere decir que no se puedan mejorar las soluciones de reparación. Es posible utilizar un algoritmo incremental a 100 98 96 94 92 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 Ingresos (% de Optimum) Ofertas Ingresos de reparación: Min 90% Ingresos de reparación óptimos: Min 85% óptimo MBB: Reparación de reparaciones: Min 90% 90%Regiones óptimas (a)-NPV 100 98 96 94 92 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 Ingresos (% de Optimum) Bichas Ingresos de reparación: Min 90% Ingresos de reparación óptimos: Min 85% MBB óptimo: Reparación Ingresos: Min 90% óptimo (óptimo (óptimo (óptimo (óptimo (b) Arbitrary-NPV Figura 4: Ingresos de soluciones sólidas óptimas.Determine una solución de reparación óptima después de un descanso, mientras que es seguro en el conocimiento de que antes de cualquier posible retiro de ofertas podemos establecer un límite inferior en los ingresos de una reparación. Kastner et al.han proporcionado tal formulación de ILP incremental [15]. Los bonos de oferta mutua facilitan el retroceso de la oferta en los elementos ya asignados. Esto mejora la reparabilidad de todas las soluciones posibles, lo que aumenta los ingresos de la solución sólida óptima en promedio. La Figura 4 muestra el aumento en los ingresos de soluciones sólidas en tales casos. Los ingresos de las soluciones de reparación están limitados en al menos el 90% del óptimo en nuestros experimentos, lo que permite una comparación directa con soluciones sólidas que ya se encuentran utilizando la misma restricción de ingresos pero no proporcionar un retroceso. Es inmediatamente obvio que tal mecanismo puede aumentar significativamente los ingresos al tiempo que mantiene la robustez de la solución. La Tabla 4 muestra el número de ofertas ganadoras que participan en soluciones sólidas óptimas y óptimas dadas las tres restricciones diferentes en las soluciones de reparación enumeradas al comienzo de esta sección. A medida que aumenta el número de ofertas, más de las soluciones generales óptimas son robustas. Esto lleva a una convergencia en el número de ofertas ganadoras. Los números entre paréntesis se derivan del análisis de sensibilidad de soluciones óptimas que revela el hecho de que casi todas las soluciones óptimas para subastas de 2000 ofertas son robustas. Por lo tanto, podemos inferir que el número promedio de ofertas ganadoras en las soluciones robustas de ingresos converge hacia el de las soluciones generales óptimas. Un efecto secundario notable de soluciones robustas es que menos ofertas participan en las soluciones. Se puede ver claramente en la Tabla 4 que cuando las limitaciones de ingresos en las soluciones de reparación son ajustadas, hay menos ofertas ganadoras en la solución óptima robusta en promedio. Esto es particularmente pronunciado para subastas más pequeñas en ambas distribuciones. Esto puede ganar beneficios para el tomador de ofertas, como los gastos generales reducidos para tratar con menos proveedores.

Esto es de esperar porque una mayor fracción de estas soluciones es de hecho óptima, como vimos en la Tabla 2. 6. La discusión y las estrategias de licitación de trabajo futuros pueden volverse complejas en mecanismos no compatibles con incentivos donde la determinación del ganador ya no es necesariamente óptima. La reparabilidad percibida de una oferta puede influir en el monto de la oferta, con ofertas reafirmables que alcanzan un punto de equilibrio más bajo y las ofertas irreparables percibidas son más agresivas. Los pagos de sanciones para el retiro de ofertas también crean un incentivo para una licitación más agresiva al proporcionar una forma de seguro contra la maldición de los ganadores [8]. Si los postores ganadores revisaron la valoración de un conjunto de artículos cae en más de la multa por retirarse de la oferta, entonces es lo mejor para su interés perder los artículos y pagar la multa. Si las reglas de subasta indican que el licitador se negará a vender los artículos a cualquiera de los postores restantes en caso de retiro, entonces el seguro contra posibles pérdidas estimulará las licitaciones más agresivas. Sin embargo, en nuestro caso estamos buscando reparar la solución con las ofertas dadas. Un efecto secundario de dicha política es compensar la mayor agresividad al incentivar las valoraciones reducidas en la expectativa de que se retire la oferta exitosa de otros licitadores. Harstad y Rothkopf [8] examinaron las condiciones requeridas para garantizar una posición de equilibrio en la que la licitación era al menos tan agresiva como si no se permitiera ningún retiro de oferta, dado este incentivo compensatario para subestimar una valoración. Tres resultados principales surgieron de su estudio del retiro de ofertas en una sola subasta de ítems: 1. La licitación de equilibrio es más agresiva con el retiro de probabilidades suficientemente pequeñas de un laudo al segundo postor más alto en caso de retiro de oferta;2. La licitación de equilibrio es más agresiva con el retiro si el número de postores es lo suficientemente grande;3. Para muchas distribuciones de costos y estimaciones, la licitación de equilibrio es más agresiva con el retiro si la variabilidad de la distribución de estimación es suficientemente grande. Es importante que los bonos de oferta mutua no dan como resultado una licitación deprimida en equilibrio. Un análisis del comportamiento resultante de los licitadores debe incorporar la posibilidad de que un postor gane un artículo y que lo retire para que la oferta formule una solución de reparación después de un descanso en otro lugar. Harstad y Rothkopf han analizado la agresividad del postor [8] utilizando un modelo teórico estrictamente del juego en el que la única razón para el retiro de ofertas es la maldición de los ganadores. Asumieron que todos los postores eran neutrales en el riesgo, pero supuso que es completamente posible que el licitante recaude una prima de riesgo de los postores de los arriesgados con la oferta de dicho seguro. Las subastas combinatorias con bonos de oferta mutua agregan un incentivo adicional para una oferta agresiva debido a la posibilidad de ser compensado por que una oferta ganadora retire por una oferta. Esto es militado por la mayor probabilidad de no retirarse en una solución de reparación. Dejamos un análisis en profundidad de las condiciones suficientes para una licitación más agresiva para trabajos futuros. Mientras que el marco WSS proporciona una amplia flexibilidad y expresividad, la escalabilidad se convierte en un problema para subastas más grandes. Aunque las soluciones a subastas más grandes tienden a ser naturalmente más robustas, algunos tomadores de ofertas en tales subastas pueden requerir robustez. Una posible extensión de nuestro trabajo en este documento puede ser examinar la viabilidad de reformular programas lineales enteros para que las soluciones sean robustas. Hebrard et al.[10] examinó la reformulación de CSP para encontrar súper soluciones. Alternativamente, puede ser posible utilizar un enfoque de arriba hacia abajo al observar las soluciones K-Best secuencialmente, en términos de ingresos, y realizar un análisis de sensibilidad en cada solución hasta que se encuentre una robusta. En la configuración de adquisiciones, el principio de eliminación gratuita a menudo se descuenta y todos los artículos deben venderse. Esto reduce el número de posibles soluciones y, por lo tanto, reduce la reparabilidad de cada solución. El impacto de tal restricción en los ingresos de soluciones sólidas también se deja para un trabajo futuro. Hay otra dirección interesante que este trabajo puede tomar, a saber, un diseño de mecanismo robusto. Porter et al.introdujo la noción de diseño de mecanismo tolerante a fallas en el que los agentes tienen información privada sobre los costos de finalización de la tarea, pero también sus probabilidades de falla [20]. Cuando el tomador de ofertas tiene valoraciones combinatorias para la finalización de la tarea, puede ser deseable asignar la misma tarea a varios agentes para garantizar la solidez de la solución. Es deseable minimizar tales tareas potencialmente redundantes, pero no en detrimento de las valoraciones de tareas completadas. Este problema podría modelarse utilizando el marco WSS de manera similar al de las subastas combinatorias. En el caso de que no se encuentren soluciones sólidas, es posible optimizar la robustez, en lugar de los ingresos, al encontrar una solución de al menos un ingreso dado que minimiza la probabilidad de un descanso irreparable. De esta manera, se puede elegir la solución menos frágil de ingresos adecuados.7. Conclusión La justicia a menudo se cita como una razón para elegir la solución óptima en términos de ingresos solo [22]. Las soluciones sólidas militadas contra las ofertas consideradas frágiles, por lo tanto, los licitadores deben ganarse la reputación de ser confiables para relajar la restricción de reparabilidad adjunta a sus ofertas. Esto puede verse como justo para los socios comerciales de larga data cuya confiabilidad es incuestionable. Las subastas basadas en Internet a menudo son vistas como ejercicios no deseados de regalos de precios por parte de los proveedores en muchos sectores [6, 17]. Las asociaciones comerciales tradicionales están siendo cortadas por una mayor competencia entre los proveedores. La calidad del servicio puede sufrir debido al mayor enfoque en la rentabilidad a corto plazo en detrimento de la oferta a largo plazo. Las soluciones robustas pueden proporcionar un medio para discriminar selectivamente a los licitadores desconfiados de manera medida. A medida que el despliegue de la subasta combinatoria se mueve de subastas de gran valor con un pequeño grupo de licitadores de confianza (por ejemplo, ventas de derechos de espectro) hacia subastas de menor valor con licitadores potencialmente desconocidos (p. Ej. Gestión de la cadena de suministro [30]), la robustez de la solución se vuelve más relevante. Además de ser utilizado para garantizar que el tomador de ofertas no sea vulnerable al retiro de ofertas, también puede usarse para consolidar relaciones con proveedores preferidos, posiblemente titulares.191 Hemos demostrado que es posible lograr soluciones sólidas para CAS con solo una pequeña pérdida en los ingresos. También hemos ilustrado cómo tales soluciones tienden a tener menos ofertas ganadoras que las soluciones óptimas generales, reduciendo así los gastos generales asociados con el trato con más licitadores. También hemos demostrado que la introducción de bonos de ofertas mutuas, una forma de contrato de compromiso nivelado, puede aumentar significativamente los ingresos de soluciones sólidas óptimas al mejorar la reparabilidad. Sostenemos que las soluciones sólidas que usan dicho mecanismo pueden permitir que un tomador de ofertas ofrezca la posibilidad de retirar la oferta a los licitadores, mientras que queda seguro de los ingresos de postepair y también facilita la mayor agresividad de los postres.8.

        "We then establish robust solutions for CAs using the WSS framework. 5.1 Sensitivity Analysis for the WDP We have performed sensitivity analysis of the following four distributions: airport take-off/landing slots (matching), electronic components (arbitrary), property/spectrum-rights (regions) and transportation (paths).",
        "These distributions were chosen because they describe a broad array of bidding patterns in different application domains.",
        "The method used is as follows.",
        "We first of all determined the optimal solution using lp_solve, a mixed integer linear program solver [3].",
        "We then simulated a single bid withdrawal and re-solved the problem with the other winning bids remaining fixed, i.e. there were no involuntary dropouts.",
        "The optimal repair solution was then determined.",

        "There are some cases however when such withdrawals result in solutions whose revenue is significantly lower than optimum.",
        "Even in auctions with as many as 2000 bids there are occasions when a single bid withdrawal can result in a drop in revenue of over 5%, although the average worst-case drop in revenue is only 1%.",
        "Figure 3(b) shows how the matching distribution is more brittle on average than paths and also has an inferior worst-case revenue on average.",
        "This trend continues as the regions-npv (Figure 3(c)) and arbitrary-npv (Figure 3(d)) distributions are more brittle still.",
        "These distributions are clearly sensitive to bid withdrawal when no other winning bids in the solution may be involuntarily withdrawn by the bid-taker. 5.2 Robust Solutions using WSS In this section we focus upon both the arbitrary-npv and regions-npv distributions because the sensitivity analysis indicated that these types of auctions produce optimal solutions that tend to be most brittle, and therefore stand to benefit most from solution robustness.",
        "We ignore the auctions with 2000 bids because the sensitivity analysis has indicated that these auctions are inherently robust with a very low average drop in revenue following a bid withdrawal.",
        "They would also be very computationally expensive, given the extra complexity of finding robust solutions.",
        "A pure CP approach needs to be augmented with global constraints that incorporate operations research techniques to increase pruning sufficiently so that thousands of bids may be examined.",

        "The integer programming formulation of the WDP stipulates that a bid either loses or wins.",
        "If we relax this constraint so that bids can partially win, this corresponds to the linear relaxation of the problem and is solvable in polynomial time.",
        "At each node of the search tree we can quickly solve the linear relaxation of the remaining problem in the subtree below the current node to establish an upper bound on remaining revenue.",
        "If this upper bound plus revenue in the parent tree is less than the current lower bound on revenue, search at that node can cease.",

        "The WSS solver we have developed is an extension of the super solution solver presented in [9, 10].",
        "This solver is, in turn, based upon the EFC constraint solver [2].",
        "Combinatorial auctions are easily modeled as a constraint optimization problems.",
        "We have chosen the branch-on-bids formulation because in tests it worked faster than a branch-on-items formulation for the arbitrary-npv and regions-npv distributions.",
        "All variables are binary and our search mechanism uses a reverse lexicographic value ordering heuristic.",
        "This complements our dynamic variable ordering heuristic that selects the most promising unassigned variable as the next one in the search tree.",
        "We use the product of the solution of the LP relaxation and the degree of a variable to determine the likelihood of its participation in a robust solution.",
        "High values in the LP solution are a strong indication of variables most likely to form a high revenue solution whilst the a variables degree reflects the number of other bids that overlap in terms of desired items.",
        "Bids for large numbers of items tend to be more robust, which is why we weight our robust solution search in this manner.",
        "We found this heuristic to be slightly more effective than the LP solution alone.",
        "As the number of bids in the auction increases however, there is an increase in the inherent robustness of solutions so the degree of a variable loses significance as the auction size increases. 5.3 Results Our experiments simulate three different constraints on repair solutions.",
        "The first is that no winning bids are withdrawn by the bid-taker and a repair solution must return a revenue of at least 90% of the optimal overall solution.",
        "Secondly, we relaxed the revenue constraint to 85% of optimum.",
        "Thirdly, we allowed backtracking by the bid-taker on winning bids using mutual bid bonds but maintaining the revenue constraint at 90% of optimum.",
        "Prior to finding a robust solution we solved the WDP optimally using lp_solve [3].",
        "We then set the minimum tolerable revenue for a solution to be 90% (then 85%) of the revenue of this optimal solution.",
        "We assumed that all bids were brittle, thus a repair solution is required for every bid in the solution.",
        "Initially we assume that no backtracking was permitted on assignments of items to other winning bids given a bid withdrawal elsewhere in the solution.",
        "Table 2 shows the percentage of optimal solutions that are robust for minimum revenue constraints for repair solutions of 90% and 85% of optimal revenue.",
        "Relaxing the revenue constraint on repair solutions to 85% of the optimum revenue greatly increases the number of optimal solutions that are robust.",
        "We also conducted experiments on the same auctions in which backtracking by the bid-taker is permitted using mutual bid bonds.",
        "This significantly improves the reparability of optimal solutions whilst still maintaining repair solutions of 90% of optimum.",
        "An interesting feature of the arbitrary-npv distribution is that optimal solutions can become more brittle as the number of bids increases.",
        "The reason for this is that optimal solutions for larger auctions have more winning bids.",
        "Some of the optimal solutions for the smallest auctions with 100 bids have only one winning bidder.",
        "If this bid is withdrawn it is usually easy to find a new repair solution within 90% of the previous optimal revenue.",
        "Also, repair solutions for bids that contain a small number of items may be made difficult by the fact that a reduced number of bids cover only a subset of those items.",
        "A mitigating factor is that such bids form a smaller percentage of the revenue of the optimal solution on average.",
        "We also implemented a rule stipulating that any losing bids from 189 Table 2: Optimal Solutions that are Inherently Robust (%). #Bids Min Revenue 100 250 500 1000 2000 arbitrary-npv repair ≥ 90% 21 5 3 37 93 repair ≥ 85% 26 15 40 87 100 MBB & repair ≥ 90% 41 35 60 94 ≥ 93 regions-npv repair ≥ 90% 30 33 61 91 98 repair ≥ 85% 50 71 95 100 100 MBB & repair ≥ 90% 60 78 96 99 ≥ 98 Table 3: Occurrence of Robust Solutions (%). #Bids Min Revenue 100 250 500 1000 arbitrary-npv repair ≥ 90% 58 39 51 98 repair ≥ 85% 86 88 94 99 MBB & repair ≥ 90% 78 86 98 100 regions-npv repair ≥ 90% 61 70 97 100 repair ≥ 85% 89 99 99 100 MBB & repair ≥ 90% 83 96 100 100 a withdrawing bidder cannot participate in a repair solution.",

        "Table 3 shows the percentage of auctions that support robust solutions for the arbitrary-npv and regions -npv distributions.",
        "It is clear that finding robust solutions for the former distribution is particularly difficult for auctions with 250 and 500 bids when revenue constraints are 90% of optimum.",
        "This difficulty was previously alluded to by the low percentage of optimal solutions that were robust for these auctions.",
        "Relaxing the revenue constraint helps increase the percentage of auctions in which robust solutions are achievable to 88% and 94%, respectively.",
        "This improves the reparability of all solutions thereby increasing the average revenue of the optimal robust solution.",
        "It is somewhat counterintuitive to expect a reduction in reparability of auction solutions as the number of bids increases because there tends to be an increased number of solutions above a revenue threshold in larger auctions.",
        "The MBB auction model performs very well however, and ensures that robust solutions are achievable for such inherently brittle auctions without sacrificing over 10% of optimal revenue to achieve repair solutions.",

        "Table 4 shows the number of winning bids participating in optimal and optimal robust solutions given the three different constraints on repairing solutions listed at the beginning of this section.",
        "As the number of bids increases, more of the optimal overall solutions are robust.",

        "If a winning bidders revised valuation for a set of items drops by more than the penalty for withdrawal of the bid, then it is in his best interests to forfeit the item(s) and pay the penalty.",
        "Should the auction rules state that the bid-taker will refuse to sell the items to any of the remaining bidders in the event of a withdrawal, then insurance against potential losses will stimulate more aggressive bidding.",
        "However, in our case we are seeking to repair the solution with the given bids.",
        "A side-effect of such a policy is to offset the increased aggressiveness by incentivizing reduced valuations in expectation that another bidders successful bid is withdrawn.",
        "Harstad and Rothkopf [8] examined the conditions required to ensure an equilibrium position in which bidding was at least as aggressive as if no bid withdrawal was permitted, given this countervailing incentive to under-estimate a valuation.",

        "Equilibrium bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal for sufficiently small probabilities of an award to the second highest bidder in the event of a bid withdrawal; 2.",
        "Equilibrium bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal if the number of bidders is large enough; 3.",
        "For many distributions of costs and estimates, equilibrium bidding is more aggressive with withdrawal if the variability of the estimating distribution is sufficiently large.",
        "It is important that mutual bid bonds do not result in depressed bidding in equilibrium.",
        "An analysis of the resultant behavior of bidders must incorporate the possibility of a bidder winning an item and having it withdrawn in order for the bid-taker to formulate a repair solution after a break elsewhere.",
        "Harstad and Rothkopf have analyzed bidder aggressiveness [8] using a strictly game-theoretic model in which the only reason for bid withdrawal is the winners curse.",

        "Combinatorial auctions with mutual bid bonds add an extra incentive to bid aggressively because of the possibility of being compensated for having a winning bid withdrawn by a bid-taker.",

        "CONCLUSION Fairness is often cited as a reason for choosing the optimal solution in terms of revenue only [22].",

        "We have also illustrated how such solutions tend to have fewer winning bids than overall optimal solutions, thereby reducing any overheads associated with dealing with more bidders.",

                "When faced with such unreliable bidders, it is preferable for the bid-taker to preempt such uncertainty by having a solution that is robust to bid withdrawal and provides a guarantee that possible withdrawals may be repaired easily with a bounded loss in revenue.",
                "In this paper, we propose an approach to addressing the Bidtakers Exposure Problem.",

                "A weighted super solution guarantees that any subset of bids likely to be withdrawn can be repaired to form a new solution of at least a given revenue by making limited changes.",
                "Secondly, we introduce an auction model that uses a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27], which we have called mutual bid bonds, to improve solution reparability by facilitating backtracking on winning bids by the bid-taker.",

                "Given a bid withdrawal in a combinatorial auction, finding an alternative repair solution of adequate revenue without causing undue disturbance to the remaining winning bids in the original solution may be difficult or even impossible.",
                "We have called this the Bid-takers Exposure Problem.",
                "When faced with such unreliable bidders, it is preferable for the bid-taker to preempt such uncertainty by having a solution that is robust to bid withdrawal and provides a guarantee that possible withdrawals may be repaired easily with a bounded loss in revenue.",
                "In this paper, we propose an approach to addressing the Bidtakers Exposure Problem.",
                "Firstly, we use the Weighted Super Solutions framework [13], from the field of constraint programming, to solve the problem of finding a robust solution.",
                "A weighted super solution guarantees that any subset of bids likely to be withdrawn can be repaired to form a new solution of at least a given revenue by making limited changes.",
                "Secondly, we introduce an auction model that uses a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27], which we have called mutual bid bonds, to improve solution reparability by facilitating backtracking on winning bids by the bid-taker.",
                "We then examine the trade-off between robustness and revenue in different economically motivated auction scenarios for different constraints on the revenue of repair solutions.",
                "We also demonstrate experimentally that fewer winning bids partake in robust solutions, thereby reducing any associated overhead in dealing with extra bidders.",
                "Robust solutions can also provide a means of selectively discriminating against distrusted bidders in a measured manner.",

                "Revenue is the most obvious optimization criterion for such auctions, but another desirable attribute is solution robustness.",
                "In terms of combinatorial auctions, a robust solution is one that can withstand bid withdrawal (a break) by making changes easily to form a repair solution of adequate revenue.",
                "A brittle solution to a CA is one in which an unacceptable loss in revenue is unavoidable if a winning bid is withdrawn.",
                "In such situations the bid-taker may be left with a set of items deemed to be of low value by all other bidders.",
                "These bidders may associate a higher value for these items if they were combined with items already awarded to others, hence the bid-taker is left in an undesirable local optimum in which a form of backtracking is required to reallocate the items in a manner that results in sufficient revenue.",
                "We have called this the Bid-takers Exposure Problem that bears similarities to the Exposure Problem faced by bidders seeking multiple items in separate single-unit auctions but holding little or no value for a subset of those items.",
                "However, reallocating items may be regarded as disruptive to a solution in many real-life scenarios.",
                "Consider a scenario where procurement for a business is conducted using a CA.",
                "It would be highly undesirable to retract contracts from a group of suppliers because of the failure of a third party.",
                "A robust solution that is tolerant of such breaks is preferable.",
                "Robustness may be regarded as a preventative measure protecting against future uncertainty by sacrificing revenue in place of solution stability and reparability.",
                "We assume a probabilistic approach whereby the bid-taker has knowledge of the reliability of bidders from which the likelihood of an incomplete transaction may be inferred.",
                "Repair solutions are required for bids that are seen as brittle (i.e. likely to break).",

                "This paper is organized as follows.",
                "Section 2 presents the Winner Determination Problem (WDP) for combinatorial auctions, outlines some possible reasons for bid withdrawal and shows how simply maximizing expected revenue can lead to intolerable revenue losses for risk-averse bid-takers.",
                "This motivates the use of robust solutions and Section 3 introduces a constraint programming (CP) framework, Weighted Super Solutions [13], that finds such solutions.",
                "We then propose an auction model in Section 4 that enhances reparability by introducing <br>mandatory mutual bid bond</br>s, that may be seen as a form of leveled commitment contract [26, 27].",
                "Section 5 presents an extensive empirical evaluation of the approach presented in this paper, in the context of a number of well-known combinatorial auction distributions, with very encouraging results.",

                "The bidtaker has a set of m items for sale, M = {1, 2, . . . , m}, and bidders submit a set of bids, B = {B1, B2, . . . , Bn}.",

                "We are interested in bid withdrawals that occur between the announcement of winning bids and the end of the transaction phase.",
                "All bids are valid until the transaction is complete, so we anticipate an expedient transaction process1 . 1 In some instances the transaction period may be so lengthy that consideration of non-winning bids as still being valid may not be fair.",

                "Harstad and Rothkopf [8] outlined several possibilities for breaks in single item auctions that include: 1. an erroneous initial valuation/bid; 2. unexpected events outside the winning bidders control; 3. a desire to have the second-best bid honored; 4. information obtained or events that occurred after the auction but before the transaction that reduces the value of an item; 5. the revelation of competing bidders valuations infers reduced profitability, a problem known as the Winners Curse.",
                "Kastner et al. [15] examined how to handle perturbations given a solution whilst minimizing necessary changes to that solution.",
                "These perturbations may include bid withdrawals, change of valuation/items of a bid or the submission of a new bid.",
                "They looked at the problem of finding incremental solutions to restructure a supply chain whose formation is determined using combinatorial auctions [30].",
                "Following a perturbation in the optimal solution they proceed to impose involuntary item withdrawals from winning bidders.",
                "They formulated an incremental integer linear program (ILP) that sought to maximize the valuation of the repair solution whilst preserving the previous solution as much as possible. 2.2 Being Proactive against Bid Withdrawal When a bid is withdrawn there may be constraints on how the solution can be repaired.",
                "If the bid-taker was freely able to revoke the awarding of items to other bidders then the solution could be repaired easily by reassigning all the items to the optimal solution without the withdrawn bid.",
                "Alternatively, the bidder who reneged upon a bid may have all his other bids disqualified and the items could be reassigned based on the optimum solution without that bidder present.",

                "A risk-averse bid-taker may not tolerate such a possibility, preferring to sacrifice revenue for reduced risk.",
                "If we modify our repair search so that a solution of at least a given revenue is guaranteed, the search for a repair solution becomes a satisfiability test rather than an optimization problem.",

Constraint satisfaction involves finding values for each of the problem variables such that all constraints are satisfied.",
