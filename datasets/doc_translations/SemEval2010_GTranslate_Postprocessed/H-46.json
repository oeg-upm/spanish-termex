Box 90153, 5000 LE Tilburg, The Netherlands Antal.vdnBosch@uvt.nl ABSTRACT Expertise retrieval has been largely unexplored on data other than the W3C collection. At the same time, many intranets of universities and other knowledge-intensive organisations offer examples of relatively small but clean multilingual expertise data, covering broad ranges of expertise areas. We first present two main expertise retrieval tasks, along with a set of baseline approaches based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding expertise relations between topics and people. For our experimental evaluation, we introduce (and release) a new test set based on a crawl of a university site. Using this test set, we conduct two series of experiments. The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise retrieval methods applied to the new test set. The second is aimed at assessing refined models that exploit characteristic features of the new test set, such as the organizational structure of the university, and the hierarchical structure of the topics in the test set. Expertise retrieval models are shown to be robust with respect to environments smaller than the W3C collection, and current techniques appear to be generalizable to other settings.

INTRODUCTION An organizations intranet provides a means for exchanging information between employees and for facilitating employee collaborations. To efficiently and effectively achieve this, it is necessary to provide search facilities that enable employees not only to access documents, but also to identify expert colleagues. At the TREC Enterprise Track [22] the need to study and understand expertise retrieval has been recognized through the introduction of Expert Finding tasks. The goal of expert finding is to identify a list of people who are knowledgeable about a given topic. This task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between people and topics [10]; commonly, a co-occurrence of the name of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be evidence of expertise. An alternative task, which using the same idea of people-topic associations, is expert profiling, where the task is to return a list of topics that a person is knowledgeable about [3]. The launch of the Expert Finding task at TREC has generated a lot of interest in expertise retrieval, with rapid progress being made in terms of modeling, algorithms, and evaluation aspects. However, nearly all of the expert finding or profiling work performed has been validated experimentally using the W3C collection [24] from the Enterprise Track. While this collection is currently the only publicly available test collection for expertise retrieval tasks, it only represents one type of intranet. With only one test collection it is not possible to generalize conclusions to other realistic settings. In this paper we focus on expertise retrieval in a realistic setting that differs from the W3C setting-one in which relatively small amounts of clean, multilingual data are available, that cover a broad range of expertise areas, as can be found on the intranets of universities and other knowledge-intensive organizations. Typically, this setting features several additional types of structure: topical structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization), organizational structure (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications, and academic homepages). This setting is quite different from the W3C setting in ways that might impact upon the performance of expertise retrieval tasks. We focus on a number of research questions in this paper: Does the relatively small amount of data available on an intranet affect the quality of the topic-person associations that lie at the heart of expertise retrieval algorithms? How do state-of-the-art algorithms developed on the W3C data set perform in the alternative scenario of the type described above? More generally, do the lessons from the Expert Finding task at TREC carry over to this setting? How does the inclusion or exclusion of different documents affect expertise retrieval tasks? In addition to, how can the topical and organizational structure be used for retrieval purposes? To answer our research questions, we first present a set of baseline approaches, based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding associations between topics and people. This allows us to formulate the expert finding and expert profiling tasks in a uniform way, and has the added benefit of allowing us to understand the relations between the two tasks. For our experimental evaluation, we introduce a new data set (the UvT Expert Collection) which is representative of the type of intranet that we described above. Our collection is based on publicly available data, crawled from the website of Tilburg University (UvT). This type of data is particularly interesting, since (1) it is clean, heterogeneous, structured, and focused, but comprises a limited number of documents; (2) contains information on the organizational hierarchy; (3) it is bilingual (English and Dutch); and (4) the list of expertise areas of an individual are provided by the employees themselves. Using the UvT Expert collection, we conduct two sets of experiments. The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise finding and profiling methods in this new setting. A second group of experiments is aimed at extensions of the baseline methods that exploit characteristic features of the UvT Expert Collection; specifically, we propose and evaluate refined expert finding and profiling methods that incorporate topicality and organizational structure. Apart from the research questions and data set that we contribute, our main contributions are as follows. The baseline models developed for expertise finding perform well on the new data set. While on the W3C setting the expert finding task appears to be more difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case. We find that profiling on the UvT data set is considerably more difficult than on the W3C set, which we believe is due to the large (but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling: about 1,500 for the UvT set, versus 50 in the W3C case. Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly improve retrieval performance. The best performing similarity measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the W3C (and other) settings as well. Finally, we demonstrate that the organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section we review related work. Then, in Section 3 we provide detailed descriptions of the expertise retrieval tasks that we address in this paper: expert finding and expert profiling. In Section 4 we present our baseline models, of which the performance is then assessed in Section 6 using the UvT data set that we introduce in Section 5. Advanced models exploiting specific features of our data are presented in Section 7 and evaluated in Section 8. We formulate our conclusions in Section 9. 2. RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11]. Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords. For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5]. More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise. In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise. One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods. Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts. In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate. Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20]. Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates. Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics. Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles. While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization. Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input. As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13]. We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people. In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner. Our modeling proceeds in two steps. In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19]. The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3. TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic). To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models. In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling. By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?. E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any). Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem. Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic. We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q? That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability. The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic. The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately. Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query. Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes. Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic. Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about? Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around. The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas. This is the candidates topical profile. Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization. However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time. By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 . A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)). Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile. Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area. Examples of such context are: Who does she work with? What are her contact details? Is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself? What is her role in the organization? Who is her superior? Collaborators, and affiliations, etc. are all part of the candidates social profile, and can serve as a background against which the systems recommendations should be interpreted. In this paper we only address the problem of determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work. We state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: What is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidates (expertise) profile? where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca). Our task, then, is to estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required. Both the expert finding and profiling tasks rely on the accurate estimation of p(q|ca). The only difference derives from the prior probability that a person is an expert (p(ca)), which can be incorporated into the expert finding task. This prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 4. BASELINE MODELS In this section we describe our baseline models for estimating p(q|ca), i.e., associations between topics and people. Both expert finding and expert profiling boil down to this estimation. We employ three models for calculating this probability. 4.1 From topics to candidates Using Candidate Models: Model 1 Model 1 [4] defines the probability of a query given a candidate (p(q|ca)) using standard language modeling techniques, based on a multinomial unigram language model. For each candidate ca, a candidate language model θca is inferred such that the probability of a term given θca is nonzero for all terms, i.e., p(t|θca) > 0. From the candidate model the query is generated with the following probability: p(q|θca) = Y t∈q p(t|θca)n(t,q) , where each term t in the query q is sampled identically and independently, and n(t, q) is the number of times t occurs in q. The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities. Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document. The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2. The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) . Model 1 amasses all the term information from all the documents associated with the candidate, and uses this to represent that candidate. This model is used to predict how likely a candidate would produce a query q. This can can be intuitively interpreted as the probability of this candidate talking about the query topic, where we assume that this is indicative of their expertise. Using Document Models: Model 2 Model 2 [4] takes a different approach. Here, the process is broken into two parts. Given a candidate ca, (1) a document that is associated with a candidate is selected with probability p(d|ca), and (2) from this document a query q is generated with probability p(q|d). Then the sum over all documents is taken to obtain p(q|ca), such that: p(q|ca) = X d p(q|d)p(d|ca). (5) The probability of a query given a document is estimated by inferring a document language model θd for each document d in a similar manner as the candidate model was inferred: p(t|θd) = (1 − λ)p(t|d) + λp(t), (6) where p(t|d) is the probability of the term in the document. The probability of a query given the document model is: p(q|θd) = Y t∈q p(t|θd)n(t,q) . The final estimate of p(q|ca) is obtained by substituting p(q|d) for p(q|θd) into Eq. 5 (see [4] for full details). Conceptually, Model 2 differs from Model 1 because the candidate is not directly modeled. Instead, the document acts like a hidden variable in the process which separates the query from the candidate. This process is akin to how a user may search for candidates with a standard search engine: initially by finding the documents which are relevant, and then seeing who is associated with that document. By examining a number of documents the user can obtain an idea of which candidates are more likely to discuss the topic q. Using Topic Models: Model 3 We introduce a third model, Model 3. Instead of attempting to model the query generation process via candidate or document models, we represent the query as a topic language model and directly estimate the probability of the candidate p(ca|q). This approach is similar to the model presented in [3, 19]. As with the previous models, a language model is inferred, but this time for the query. We adapt the work of Lavrenko and Croft [14] to estimate a topic model from the query. The procedure is as follows. Given a collection of documents and a query topic q, it is assumed that there exists an unknown topic model θk that assigns probabilities p(t|θk) to the term occurrences in the topic documents. Both the query and the documents are samples from θk (as opposed to the previous approaches, where a query is assumed to be sampled from a specific document or candidate model). The main task is to estimate p(t|θk), the probability of a term given the topic model. Since the query q is very sparse, and as there are no examples of documents on the topic, this distribution needs to be approximated. Lavrenko and Croft [14] suggest a reasonable way of obtaining such an approximation, by assuming that p(t|θk) can be approximated by the probability of term t given the query q. We can then estimate p(t|q) using the joint probability of observing the term t together with the query terms, q1, . . . , qm, and dividing by the joint probability of the query terms: p(t|θk) ≈ p(t|q) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) p(q1, . . . , qm) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm) , where p(q1, . . . , qm) = P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm), and T is the entire vocabulary of terms. In order to estimate the joint probability p(t, q1, . . . , qm), we follow [14, 15] and assume t and q1, . . . , qm are mutually independent, once we pick a source distribution from the set of underlying source distributions U. If we choose U to be a set of document models. then to construct this set, the query q would be issued against the collection, and the top n returned are assumed to be relevant to the topic, and thus treated as samples from the topic model. (Note that candidate models could be used instead.) With the document models forming U, the joint probability of term and query becomes: p(t, q1, . . . , qm) = X d∈U p(d) ˘ p(t|θd) mY i=1 p(qi|θd) ¯ . (7) Here, p(d) denotes the prior distribution over the set U, which reflects the relevance of the document to the topic. We assume that p(d) is uniform across U. In order to rank candidates according to the topic model defined, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence metric (KL, [8]) to measure the difference between the candidate models and the topic model: KL(θk||θca) = X t p(t|θk) log p(t|θk) p(t|θca) . (8) Candidates with a smaller divergence from the topic model are considered to be more likely experts on that topic. The candidate model θca is defined in Eq. 4. By using KL divergence instead of the probability of a candidate given the topic model p(ca|θk), we avoid normalization problems. 4.2 Document-candidate associations For our models we need to be able to estimate the probability p(d|ca), which expresses the extent to which a document d characterizes the candidate ca. In [4], two methods are presented for estimating this probability, based on the number of person names recognized in a document. However, in our (intranet) setting it is reasonable to assume that authors of documents can unambiguously be identified (e.g., as the author of an article, the teacher assigned to a course, the owner of a web page, etc.) Hence, we set p(d|ca) to be 1 if candidate ca is author of document d, otherwise the probability is 0. In Section 6 we describe how authorship can be determined on different types of documents within the collection. 5. THE UVT EXPERT COLLECTION The UvT Expert collection used in the experiments in this paper fits the scenario outlined in Section 3. The collection is based on the Webwijs (Webwise) system developed at Tilburg University (UvT) in the Netherlands. Webwijs (http://www.uvt.nl/ webwijs/) is a publicly accessible database of UvT employees who are involved in research or teaching; currently, Webwijs contains information about 1168 experts, each of whom has a page with contact information and, if made available by the expert, a research description and publications list. In addition, each expert can select expertise areas from a list of 1491 topics and is encouraged to suggest new topics that need to be approved by the Webwijs editor. Each topic has a separate page that shows all experts associated with that topic and, if available, a list of related topics. Webwijs is available in Dutch and English, and this bilinguality has been preserved in the collection. Every Dutch Webwijs page has an English translation. Not all Dutch topics have an English translation, but the reverse is true: the 981 English topics all have a Dutch equivalent. About 42% of the experts teach courses at Tilburg University; these courses were also crawled and included in the profile. In addition, about 27% of the experts link to their academic homepage from their Webwijs page. These home pages were crawled and added to the collection. (This means that if experts put the full-text versions of their publications on their academic homepage, these were also available for indexing.) We also obtained 1880 full-text versions of publications from the UvT institutional repository and Dutch English no. of experts 1168 1168 no. of experts with ≥ 1 topic 743 727 no. of topics 1491 981 no. of expert-topic pairs 4318 3251 avg. no. of topics/expert 5.8 5.9 max. no. of topics/expert (no. of experts) 60 (1) 35 (1) min. no. of topics/expert (no. of experts) 1 (74) 1 (106) avg. no. of experts/topic 2.9 3.3 max. no. of experts/topic (no. of topics) 30 (1) 30 (1) min. no. of experts/topic (no. of topics) 1 (615) 1 (346) no. of experts with HP 318 318 no. of experts with CD 318 318 avg. no. of CDs per teaching expert 3.5 3.5 no. of experts with RD 329 313 no. of experts with PUB 734 734 avg. no. of PUBs per expert 27.0 27.0 avg. no. of PUB citations per expert 25.2 25.2 avg. no. of full-text PUBs per expert 1.8 1.8 Table 2: Descriptive statistics of the Dutch and English versions of the UvT Expert collection. converted them to plain text. We ran the TextCat [23] language identifier to classify the language of the home pages and the fulltext publications. We restricted ourselves to pages where the classifier was confident about the language used on the page. This resulted in four document types: research descriptions (RD), course descriptions (CD), publications (PUB; full-text and citationonly versions), and academic homepages (HP). Everything was bundled into the UvT Expert collection which is available at http: //ilk.uvt.nl/uvt-expert-collection/. The UvT Expert collection was extracted from a different organizational setting than the W3C collection and differs from it in a number of ways. The UvT setting is one with relatively small amounts of multilingual data. Document-author associations are clear and the data is structured and clean. The collection covers a broad range of expertise areas, as one can typically find on intranets of universities and other knowledge-intensive institutes. Additionally, our university setting features several types of structure (topical and organizational), as well as multiple document types. Another important difference between the two data sets is that the expertise areas in the UvT Expert collection are self-selected instead of being based on group membership or assignments by others. Size is another dimension along which the W3C and UvT Expert collections differ: the latter is the smaller of the two. Also realistic are the large differences in the amount of information available for each expert. Utilizing Webwijs is voluntary; 425 Dutch experts did not select any topics at all. This leaves us with 743 Dutch and 727 English usable expert profiles. Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the UvT Expert collection. Universities tend to have a hierarchical structure that goes from the faculty level, to departments, research groups, down to the individual researchers. In the UvT Expert collection we have information about the affiliations of researchers with faculties and institutes, providing us with a two-level organizational hierarchy. Tilburg University has 22 organizational units at the faculty level (including the university office and several research institutes) and 71 departments, which amounts to 3.2 departments per faculty. As to the topical hierarchy used by Webwijs, 131 of the 1491 topics are top nodes in the hierarchy. This hierarchy has an average topic chain length of 2.65 and a maximum length of 7 topics. 6. EVALUATION Below, we evaluate Section 4s models for expert finding and profiling onthe UvT Expert collection. We detail our research questions and experimental setup, and then present our results. 6.1 Research Questions We address the following research questions. Both expert finding and profiling rely on the estimations of p(q|ca). The question is how the models compare on the different tasks, and in the setting of the UvT Expert collection. In [4], Model 2 outperformed Model 1 on the W3C collection. How do they compare on our data set? And how does Model 3 compare to Model 1? What about performance differences between the two languages in our test collection? 6.2 Experimental Setup The output of our models was evaluated against the self-assigned topic labels, which were treated as relevance judgements. Results were evaluated separately for English and Dutch. For English we only used topics for which the Dutch translation was available; for Dutch all topics were considered. The results were averaged for the queries in the intersection of relevance judgements and results; missing queries do not contribute a value of 0 to the scores. We use standard information retrieval measures, such as Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). We also report the percentage of topics (%q) and candidates (%ca) covered, for the expert finding and profiling tasks, respectively. 6.3 Results Table 1 shows the performance of Model 1, 2, and 3 on the expert finding and profiling tasks. The rows of the table correspond to the various document types (RD, CD, PUB, and HP) and to their combinations. RD+CD+PUB+HP is equivalent to the full collection and will be referred as the BASELINE of our experiments. Looking at Table 1 we see that Model 2 performs the best across the board. However, when the data is clean and very focused (RD), Model 3 outperforms it in a number of cases. Model 1 has the best coverage of candidates (%ca) and topics (%q). The various document types differ in their characteristics and how they improve the finding and profiling tasks. Expert profiling benefits much from the clean data present in the RD and CD document types, while the publications contribute the most to the expert finding task. Adding the homepages does not prove to be particularly useful. When we compare the results across languages, we find that the coverage of English topics (%q) is higher than of the Dutch ones for expert finding. Apart from that, the scores fall in the same range for both languages. For the profiling task the coverage of the candidates (%ca) is very similar for both languages. However, the performance is substantially better for the English topics. While it is hard to compare scores across collections, we conclude with a brief comparison of the absolute scores in Table 1 to those reported in [3, 4] on the W3C test set (2005 edition). For expert finding the MAP scores for Model 2 reported here are about 50% higher than the corresponding figures in [4], while our MRR scores are slightly below those in [4]. For expert profiling, the differences are far more dramatic: the MAP scores for Model 2 reported here are around 50% below the scores in [3], while the (best) MRR scores are about the same as those in [3]. The cause for the latter differences seems to reside in the number of knowledge areas considered here-approx. 30 times more than in the W3C setting. 7. ADVANCED MODELS Now that we have developed and assessed basic language modeling techniques for expertise retrieval, we turn to refined models that exploit special features of our test collection. 7.1 Exploiting knowledge area similarity One way to improve the scoring of a query given a candidate is to consider what other requests the candidate would satisfy and use them as further evidence to support the original query, proportional Expert finding Expert profiling Document types Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 %q MAP MRR %q MAP MRR %q MAP MRR %ca MAP MRR %ca MAP MRR %ca MAP MRR English RD 97.8 0.126 0.269 83.5 0.144 0.311 83.3 0.129 0.271 100 0.089 0.189 39.3 0.232 0.465 41.1 0.166 0.337 CD 97.8 0.118 0.227 91.7 0.123 0.248 91.7 0.118 0.226 32.8 0.188 0.381 32.4 0.195 0.385 32.7 0.203 0.370 PUB 97.8 0.200 0.330 98.0 0.216 0.372 98.0 0.145 0.257 78.9 0.167 0.364 74.5 0.212 0.442 78.9 0.135 0.299 HP 97.8 0.081 0.186 97.4 0.071 0.168 97.2 0.062 0.149 31.2 0.150 0.299 28.8 0.185 0.335 30.1 0.136 0.287 RD+CD 97.8 0.188 0.352 92.9 0.193 0.360 92.9 0.150 0.273 100 0.145 0.286 61.3 0.251 0.477 63.2 0.217 0.416 RD+CD+PUB 97.8 0.235 0.373 98.1 0.277 0.439 98.1 0.178 0.305 100 0.196 0.380 87.2 0.280 0.533 89.5 0.170 0.344 RD+CD+PUB+HP 97.8 0.237 0.372 98.6 0.280 0.441 98.5 0.166 0.293 100 0.199 0.387 88.7 0.281 0.525 90.9 0.169 0.329 Dutch RD 61.3 0.094 0.229 38.4 0.137 0.336 38.3 0.127 0.295 38.0 0.127 0.386 34.1 0.138 0.420 38.0 0.105 0.327 CD 61.3 0.107 0.212 49.7 0.128 0.256 49.7 0.136 0.261 32.5 0.151 0.389 31.8 0.158 0.396 32.5 0.170 0.380 PUB 61.3 0.193 0.319 59.5 0.218 0.368 59.4 0.173 0.291 78.8 0.126 0.364 76.0 0.150 0.424 78.8 0.103 0.294 HP 61.3 0.063 0.169 56.6 0.064 0.175 56.4 0.062 0.163 29.8 0.108 0.308 27.8 0.125 0.338 29.8 0.098 0.255 RD+CD 61.3 0.159 0.314 51.9 0.184 0.360 51.9 0.169 0.324 60.5 0.151 0.410 57.2 0.166 0.431 60.4 0.159 0.384 RD+CD+PUB 61.3 0.244 0.398 61.5 0.260 0.424 61.4 0.210 0.350 90.3 0.165 0.445 88.2 0.189 0.479 90.3 0.126 0.339 RD+CD+PUB+HP 61.3 0.249 0.401 62.6 0.265 0.436 62.6 0.195 0.344 91.9 0.164 0.426 90.1 0.195 0.488 91.9 0.125 0.328 Table 1: Performance of the models on the expert finding and profiling tasks, using different document types and their combinations. %q is the number of topics covered (applies to the expert finding task), %ca is the number of candidates covered (applies to the expert profiling task). The top and bottom blocks correspond to English and Dutch respectively. The best scores are in boldface. to how related the other requests are to the original query. This can be modeled by interpolating between the p(q|ca) and the further supporting evidence from all similar requests q , as follows: p (q|ca) = λp(q|ca) + (1 − λ) X q p(q|q )p(q |ca), (9) where p(q|q ) represents the similarity between the two topics q and q . To be able to work with similarity methods that are not necessarily probabilities, we set p(q|q ) = w(q,q ) γ , where γ is a normalizing constant, such that γ = P q w(q , q ). We consider four methods for calculating the similarity score between two topics. Three approaches are strictly content-based, and establish similarity by examining co-occurrence patterns of topics within the collection, while the last approach exploits the hierarchical structure of topical areas that may be present within an organization (see [7] for further examples of integrating word relationships into language models). The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence metric defined in Eq. 8 provides a measure of how different or similar two probability distributions are. A topic model is inferred for q and q using the method presented in Section 4.1 to describe the query across the entire vocabulary. Since a lower KL score means the queries are more similar, we let w(q, q ) = max(KL(θq||·) − KL(θq||θq )). Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI, [17]) is a measure of association used in information theory to determine the extent of independence between variables. The dependence between two queries is reflected by the SI(q, q ) score, where scores greater than zero indicate that it is likely that there is a dependence, which we take to mean that the queries are likely to be similar: SI(q, q ) = log p(q, q ) p(q)p(q ) (10) We estimate the probability of a topic p(q) using the number of documents relevant to query q within the collection. The joint probability p(q, q ) is estimated similarly, by using the concatenation of q and q as a query. To obtain p(q|q ), we then set w(q, q ) = SI(q, q ) when SI(q, q ) > 0 otherwise w(q, q ) = 0, because we are only interested in including queries that are similar. The log-likelihood statistic provides another measure of dependence, which is more reliable than the pointwise mutual information measure [17]. Let k1 be the number of co-occurrences of q and q , k2 the number of occurrences of q not co-occurring with q , n1 the total number of occurrences of q , and n2 the total number of topic tokens minus the number of occurrences of q . Then, let p1 = k1/n1, p2 = k2/n2, and p = (k1 + k2)/(n1 + n2), (q, q ) = 2( (p1, k1, n1) + (p2, k2, n2) − (p, k1, n1) − (p, k2, n2)), where (p, n, k) = k log p + (n − k) log(1 − p). The higher score indicate that queries are also likely to be similar, thus we set w(q, q ) = (q, q ). Finally, we also estimate the similarity of two topics based on their distance within the topic hierarchy. The topic hierarchy is viewed as a directed graph, and for all topic-pairs the shortest path SP(q, q ) is calculated. We set the similarity score to be the reciprocal of the shortest path: w(q, q ) = 1/SP(q, q ). 7.2 Contextual information Given the hierarchy of an organization, the units to which a person belong are regarded as a context so as to compensate for data sparseness. We model it as follows: p (q|ca) = 1 − P ou∈OU(ca) λou · p(q|ca) + P ou∈OU(ca) λou · p(q|ou), where OU(ca) is the set of organizational units of which candidate ca is a member of, and p(q|o) expresses the strength of the association between query q and the unit ou. The latter probability can be estimated using either of the three basic models, by simply replacing ca with ou in the corresponding equations. An organizational unit is associated with all the documents that its members have authored. That is, p(d|ou) = maxca∈ou p(d|ca). 7.3 A simple multilingual model For knowledge institutes in Europe, academic or otherwise, a multilingual (or at least bilingual) setting is typical. The following model builds on a kind of independence assumption: there is no spill-over of expertise/profiles across language boundaries. While a simplification, this is a sensible first approach. That is: p (q|ca) =P l∈L λl · p(ql|ca), where L is the set of languages used in the collection, ql is the translation of the query q to language l, and λl is a language specific smoothing parameter, such that P l∈L λl = 1. 8.

Which of the various methods for capturing word relationships is most effective? Furthermore, is our way of bringing in contextual information useful? For which tasks? And finally, is our simple way of combining the monolingual scores sufficient for obtaining significant improvements? 8.2 Experimental setup Given that the self-assessments are also sparse in our collection, in order to be able to measure differences between the various models, we selected a subset of topics, and evaluated (some of the) runs only on this subset. This set is referred as main topics, and consists of topics that are located at the top level of the topical hierarchy. (A main topic has subtopics, but is not a subtopic of any other topic.) This main set consists of 132 Dutch and 119 English topics. The relevance judgements were restricted to the main topic set, but were not expanded with subtopics. 8.3 Exploiting knowledge area similarity Table 4 presents the results. The four methods used for estimating knowledge-area similarity are KL divergence (KLDIV), PointLang.

We managed to improve upon the baseline in all cases, but the improvement is more noticeable for the profiling task. For both tasks, the LL method performed best. The content-based approaches performed consistently better than HDIST. 8.4 Contextual information A two level hierarchy of organizational units (faculties and institutes) is available in the UvT Expert collection. The unit a person belongs to is used as a context for that person. First, we evaluated the models of the organizational units, using all topics (ALL) and only the main topics (MAIN). An organizational unit is considered to be relevant for a given topic (or vice versa) if at least one member of the unit selected the given topic as an expertise area. Table 5 reports on the results. As far as expert finding goes, given a topic, the corresponding organizational unit can be identified with high precision. However, the expert profiling task shows a different picture: the scores are low, and the task seems hard. The explanation may be that general concepts (i.e., our main topics) may belong to several organizational units. Second, we performed another evaluation, where we combined the contextual models with the candidate models (to score candidates again). Table 6 reports on the results. We find a positive impact of the context models only for expert finding. Noticably, for expert finding (and Model 1), it improves over 50% (for English) and over 70% (for Dutch) on MAP. The poor performance on expert profiling may be due to the fact that context models alone did not perform very well on the profiling task to begin with. 8.5 Multilingual models In this subsection we evaluate the method for combining results across multiple languages that we described in Section 7.3. In our setting the set of languages consists of English and Dutch: L = {UK, NL}. The weights on these languages were set to be identical (λUK = λNL = 0.5). We performed experiments with various λ settings, but did not observe significant differences in performance. Table 3 reports on the multilingual results, where performance is evaluated on the full topic set. All three models significantly imLang.

The relative improvement of the precision scores ranges from 10% to 80%. These scores demonstrate that despite its simplicity, our method for combining results over multiple languages achieves substantial improvements over the baseline. 9. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we focused on expertise retrieval (expert finding and profiling) in a new setting of a typical knowledge-intensive organization in which the available data is of high quality, multilingual, and covering a broad range of expertise area. Typically, the amount of available data in such an organization (e.g., a university, a research institute, or a research lab) is limited when compared to the W3C collection that has mostly been used for the experimental evaluation of expertise retrieval so far. To examine expertise retrieval in this setting, we introduced (and released) the UvT Expert collection as a representative case of such knowledge intensive organizations. The new collection reflects the typical properties of knowledge-intensive institutes noted above and also includes several features which may are potentially useful for expertise retrieval, such as topical and organizational structure. We evaluated how current state-of-the-art models for expert finding and profiling performed in this new setting and then refined these models in order to try and exploit the different characteristics within the data environment (language, topicality, and organizational structure). We found that current models of expertise retrieval generalize well to this new environment; in addition we found that refining the models to account for the differences results in significant improvements, thus making up for problems caused by data sparseness issues. Future work includes setting up manual assessments of automatically generated profiles by the employees themselves, especially in cases where the employees have not provided a profile themselves. 10.

Al mismo tiempo, muchas intranets de universidades y otras organizaciones intensivas en conocimiento ofrecen ejemplos de datos de experiencia multilingües relativamente pequeños pero limpios, que cubren amplios rangos de áreas de experiencia. Primero presentamos dos tareas principales de recuperación de experiencia, junto con un conjunto de enfoques de referencia basados en el modelado de idiomas generativos, destinados a encontrar relaciones con experiencia entre temas y personas. Para nuestra evaluación experimental, presentamos (y lanzamos) un nuevo conjunto de pruebas basado en un rastreo de un sitio universitario. Usando este conjunto de pruebas, realizamos dos series de experimentos. El primero tiene como objetivo determinar la efectividad de los métodos de recuperación de experiencia basal aplicados al nuevo conjunto de pruebas. El segundo tiene como objetivo evaluar modelos refinados que exploten las características características del nuevo conjunto de pruebas, como la estructura organizativa de la universidad y la estructura jerárquica de los temas en el conjunto de pruebas. Se muestra que los modelos de recuperación de experiencia son robustos con respecto a los entornos más pequeños que la colección W3C, y las técnicas actuales parecen ser generalizables para otros entornos.

Introducción Una organización Intranet proporciona un medio para intercambiar información entre los empleados y para facilitar las colaboraciones de los empleados. Para lograr esto de manera eficiente y efectiva, es necesario proporcionar instalaciones de búsqueda que permitan a los empleados no solo acceder a documentos, sino también identificar a colegas expertos. En la pista de TREC Enterprise [22] la necesidad de estudiar y comprender la recuperación de la experiencia se ha reconocido mediante la introducción de tareas de búsqueda de expertos. El objetivo del hallazgo experto es identificar una lista de personas que conocen un tema determinado. Esta tarea generalmente se aborda al descubrir asociaciones entre personas y temas [10];Comúnmente, se supone que una concurrencia del nombre de una persona con temas en el mismo contexto es evidencia de experiencia. Una tarea alternativa, que utiliza la misma idea de asociaciones de tope de personas, es el perfil experto, donde la tarea es devolver una lista de temas sobre los que una persona tiene conocimiento [3]. El lanzamiento de la tarea de búsqueda de expertos en TREC ha generado mucho interés en la recuperación de experiencia, con un avance rápido en términos de modelado, algoritmos y aspectos de evaluación. Sin embargo, casi todo el trabajo de hallazgo o perfil de expertos realizado se ha validado experimentalmente utilizando la colección W3C [24] de la pista Enterprise. Si bien esta colección es actualmente la única colección de pruebas disponible públicamente para tareas de recuperación de experiencia, solo representa un tipo de intranet. Con solo una colección de pruebas, no es posible generalizar las conclusiones a otros entornos realistas. En este documento, nos centramos en la recuperación de experiencia en un entorno realista que difiere del entorno W3C, uno en el que hay disponibles cantidades relativamente pequeñas de datos limpios y multilingües, que cubren una amplia gama de áreas de experiencia, como se puede encontrar en las intranets deuniversidades y otras organizaciones intensivas en conocimiento. Por lo general, este entorno presenta varios tipos adicionales de estructura: estructura tópica (por ejemplo, jerarquías de temas empleadas por la organización), estructura organizacional (facultad, departamento, ...), así como múltiples tipos de documentos (investigación y descripciones de cursos,publicaciones y páginas de inicio académicas). Esta configuración es bastante diferente de la configuración W3C de manera que podría afectar el desempeño de las tareas de recuperación de experiencia. Nos centramos en una serie de preguntas de investigación en este documento: ¿La cantidad relativamente pequeña de datos disponibles en una intranet afecta la calidad de las asociaciones de personas que se encuentran en el corazón de los algoritmos de recuperación de experiencia? ¿Cómo se desarrollaron los algoritmos de última generación en el conjunto de datos W3C en el escenario alternativo del tipo descrito anteriormente? En términos más generales, ¿las lecciones de la tarea de búsqueda de expertos en TREC se trasladan a este entorno? ¿Cómo afecta la inclusión o la exclusión de diferentes documentos a las tareas de recuperación de experiencia? Además de, ¿cómo se puede utilizar la estructura tópica y organizativa para fines de recuperación? Para responder a nuestras preguntas de investigación, primero presentamos un conjunto de enfoques de referencia, basados en el modelado de lenguaje generativo, destinado a encontrar asociaciones entre temas y personas. Esto nos permite formular las tareas de hallazgo de expertos y perfiles de expertos de manera uniforme, y tiene el beneficio adicional de permitirnos comprender las relaciones entre las dos tareas. Para nuestra evaluación experimental, presentamos un nuevo conjunto de datos (la colección de expertos UVT) que es representativo del tipo de intranet que describimos anteriormente. Nuestra colección se basa en datos disponibles públicamente, arrastrados desde el sitio web de la Universidad de Tilburg (UVT). Este tipo de datos es particularmente interesante, ya que (1) es limpio, heterogéneo, estructurado y enfocado, pero comprende un número limitado de documentos;(2) contiene información sobre la jerarquía organizacional;(3) es bilingüe (inglés y holandés);y (4) la lista de áreas de especialización de un individuo es proporcionada por los propios empleados. Usando la colección UVT Expert, realizamos dos conjuntos de experimentos. El primero tiene como objetivo determinar la efectividad de los métodos de búsqueda y perfil de experiencia de referencia en este nuevo entorno. Un segundo grupo de experimentos está dirigido a extensiones de los métodos de referencia que explotan las características características de la colección de expertos UVT;Específicamente, proponemos y evaluamos métodos refinados de hallazgo y perfil de expertos que incorporan la actualidad y la estructura organizacional. Además de las preguntas de investigación y el conjunto de datos que contribuyimos, nuestras principales contribuciones son las siguientes. Los modelos de línea de base desarrollados para la búsqueda de experiencia funcionan bien en el nuevo conjunto de datos. Mientras que en la configuración de W3C, la tarea de búsqueda de expertos parece ser más difícil que el perfil, para los datos UVT lo contrario es el caso. Encontramos que el perfil en el conjunto de datos UVT es considerablemente más difícil que en el conjunto W3C, lo que creemos que se debe al gran número (pero realista) de áreas tópicas que usamos para perfilar: aproximadamente 1,500 para el conjunto UVT, versus 50En el caso W3C. Tomar en cuenta la similitud entre los temas puede mejorar significativamente el rendimiento de la recuperación. Las medidas de similitud de mejor rendimiento se basan en el contenido, por lo tanto, también se pueden aplicar en la configuración W3C (y otras). Finalmente, demostramos que la estructura organizativa puede explotarse en forma de un modelo de contexto, mejorando los puntajes de los mapas para ciertos modelos hasta en un 70%. El resto de este documento está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la siguiente sección revisamos el trabajo relacionado. Luego, en la Sección 3 proporcionamos descripciones detalladas de las tareas de recuperación de experiencia que abordamos en este documento: hallazgo de expertos y perfiles de expertos. En la Sección 4 presentamos nuestros modelos de referencia, de los cuales el rendimiento se evalúa en la Sección 6 utilizando el conjunto de datos UVT que presentamos en la Sección 5. Los modelos avanzados que explotan características específicas de nuestros datos se presentan en la Sección 7 y se evalúan en la Sección 8. Formulamos nuestras conclusiones en la Sección 9. 2. Trabajo relacionado Enfoques iniciales para la búsqueda de experiencia a menudo empleadas bases de datos que contienen información sobre las habilidades y el conocimiento de cada individuo en la organización [11]. La mayoría de estas herramientas (generalmente llamadas páginas amarillas o sistemas de búsqueda de personas) dependen de las personas para autoevaluar sus habilidades contra un conjunto predefinido de palabras clave. Para actualizar los perfiles en estos sistemas de manera automática, existe la necesidad de tecnologías inteligentes [5]. Los enfoques más recientes utilizan conjuntos de documentos específicos (como el correo electrónico [6] o el software [18]) para encontrar experiencia. En contraste con el enfoque en tipos de documentos particulares, también existe un mayor interés en el desarrollo de sistemas que indexan y extraen documentos de intranet como fuentes de evidencia de experiencia. Uno de esos enfoques publicados es el sistema P@noptic [9], que construye una representación de cada persona concatenando todos los documentos asociados con esa persona, esto es similar al Modelo 1 de Balog et al.[4], que formalizan y comparan dos métodos. Balog et al.s Modelo 1 modela directamente el conocimiento de un experto de documentos asociados, mientras que su Modelo 2 primero localiza documentos sobre el tema y luego encuentra a los expertos asociados. En los experimentos informados, el segundo método funciona significativamente mejor cuando hay suficientes documentos asociados por candidato. La mayoría de los sistemas que participaron en las ediciones de 2005 y 2006 de la tarea de búsqueda de expertos en TREC implementada (variaciones en) uno de estos dos modelos;Ver [10, 20]. MacDonald y Ounis [16] proponen un enfoque diferente para clasificar la experiencia de los candidatos con respecto a un tema basado en técnicas de fusión de datos, sin utilizar la heurística específica de colecciones;Encuentran que la aplicación de modelos de ponderación basados en el campo mejora la clasificación de candidatos. Petkova y Croft [19] proponen otro enfoque más, basado en una combinación de los Temas de modelado explícitamente de los Modelos 1 y 2 anteriores. Recurrir a otras tareas de recuperación de expertos que también se pueden abordar utilizando asociaciones de temas de personas, Balog y De Rijke [3] abordaron la tarea de determinar los perfiles de expertos tópicos. Si bien sus métodos demostraron ser eficientes en el Corpus W3C, requieren una cantidad de datos que pueden no estar disponibles en la organización típica intensiva en conocimiento. Balog y De Rijke [2] estudian la tarea relacionada de encontrar expertos que sean similares a un pequeño conjunto de expertos dados como aportes. Como aparte, crear un resumen textual de una persona muestra algunas similitudes con el hallazgo de biografía, que ha recibido una cantidad considerable de atención recientemente;Ver, por ejemplo, [13]. Utilizamos el modelado de lenguaje generativo para encontrar asociaciones entre temas y personas. En nuestro modelado de hallazgo y perfil de expertos, recopilamos evidencia de experiencia de múltiples fuentes, en una colección heterogénea, e integramos con la concurrencia de nombres de candidatos y términos de consulta: la configuración de modelado de idiomas nos permite hacerlo de manera transparente. Nuestro modelado procede en dos pasos. En el primer paso, consideramos tres modelos de referencia, dos tomados de [4] (los modelos 1 y 2 mencionados anteriormente), y uno una versión refinada de un modelo introducido en [3] (que nos referimos como modelo 3 a continuación);Este tercer modelo también es similar al modelo descrito por Petkova y Croft [19]. Los modelos que consideramos en nuestra segunda ronda de experimentos son modelos de mezcla similares a los modelos de lenguaje contextual [1] y a los documentos ampliados de Tao et al.[21];Sin embargo, las características que utilizamos para definir nuestras expansiones, incluidas la estructura tópica y la estructura organizativa, no se han utilizado de esta manera antes.3. Las tareas en el escenario de recuperación de experiencia que imaginamos, los usuarios que buscan experiencia dentro de una organización tienen acceso a una interfaz que combina un cuadro de búsqueda (donde pueden buscar expertos o temas) con estructuras de navegación (de expertos y temas) que les permite aHaga clic en su camino a una página de expertos (proporcionando el perfil de una persona) o una página de temas (proporcionando una lista de expertos sobre el tema). Para alimentar la interfaz anterior, enfrentamos dos tareas de recuperación de experiencia, hallazgo de expertos y perfiles expertos, que primero definimos y luego formalizamos el uso de modelos de lenguaje generativo. Para modelar cualquier tarea, la probabilidad de que el tema de la consulta se asocie a un experto en candidatos juega un papel clave en las estimaciones finales para la búsqueda y el perfil. Mediante el uso de modelos de lenguaje, tanto los candidatos como la consulta se caracterizan por distribuciones de términos en el vocabulario (utilizados en los documentos disponibles por la organización cuyas necesidades de recuperación de experiencia estamos abordando).3.1 Hallazgo de expertos El hallazgo de expertos implica la tarea de encontrar a la persona adecuada con las habilidades y el conocimiento apropiados: ¿Quiénes son los expertos en el Tema X? Por ejemplo, un empleado quiere determinar quién trabajó en un proyecto en particular para averiguar por qué se tomaron decisiones particulares sin tener que rastrear la documentación (si hay alguna). O bien, pueden necesitar un especialista capacitado para consultoría sobre un problema específico. Dentro de una organización, generalmente hay muchos candidatos posibles que podrían ser expertos para el tema dado. Podemos establecer este problema de la siguiente manera: ¿Cuál es la probabilidad de que una CA candidata sea un experto dado el tema de consulta Q? Es decir, determinamos P (CA | Q) y clasificamos a los candidatos CA de acuerdo con esta probabilidad. Los candidatos con la mayor probabilidad dada la consulta se consideran los expertos más probables para ese tema. El desafío es cómo estimar esta probabilidad con precisión. Dado que es probable que la consulta consista en solo unos pocos términos para describir la experiencia requerida, deberíamos poder obtener una estimación más precisa invocando el teorema de Bayes y estimando: P (Ca | Q) = P (Q | Ca) P(Ca) P (Q), (1) donde P (Ca) es la probabilidad de un candidato y P (Q) es la probabilidad de una consulta. Dado que P (Q) es una constante, se puede ignorar con fines de clasificación. Por lo tanto, la probabilidad de que una CA candidata sea un experto dada la consulta Q es proporcional a la probabilidad de una consulta dada el candidato P (Q | Ca), ponderado por la creencia a priori P (CA) que el candidato CA es un experto.P (Ca | Q) ∝ P (Q | Ca) P (Ca) (2) En este documento, nuestro enfoque principal es estimar la probabilidad de una consulta dada el candidato P (Q | Ca), porque esta probabilidad captura la extensióna lo que el candidato sabe sobre el tema de la consulta. Mientras que se supone que los anteriores de los candidatos son uniformes y, por lo tanto, no influirán en la clasificación, se ha demostrado que una elección sensata de antecedentes puede mejorar el rendimiento [20].3.2 Perfil de expertos Si bien la tarea de buscar expertos se preocupaba por encontrar expertos en un tema particular, la tarea de perfilar experto busca responder una pregunta relacionada: ¿Qué temas conoce un candidato? Esencialmente, esto cambia las cuestiones de hallazgo experto. El perfil de un candidato individual implica la identificación de áreas de habilidades y conocimiento sobre los que tienen experiencia y una evaluación del nivel de competencia en cada una de estas áreas. Este es el perfil tópico de los candidatos. En general, los perfiles tópicos dentro de las organizaciones consisten en estructuras tabulares que catalogan explícitamente las habilidades y el conocimiento de cada individuo en la organización. Sin embargo, dicha práctica está limitada por los recursos disponibles para definir, crear, mantener y actualizar estos perfiles con el tiempo. Al centrarse en los métodos automáticos que se basan en la evidencia disponible dentro de los repositorios de documentos de una organización, nuestro objetivo es reducir el esfuerzo humano asociado con el mantenimiento de los perfiles tópicos1. Un perfil tópico de un candidato, entonces, se define como un vector donde cada elemento I del vector corresponde a la experiencia de CAS candidato en un tema Ki dado, (es decir, S (CA, Ki)). Cada tema KI define un área o habilidad de conocimiento particular que la organización utiliza para definir el perfil tópico de los candidatos. Por lo tanto, se supone que una lista de temas, {K1 ,..., KN}, donde n es el número de temas predefinidos, se da: perfil (ca) = s (ca, k1), s (ca, k2) ,..., S (CA, KN).(3) Se necesitan 1 contexto y evidencia para ayudar a los usuarios de los sistemas de búsqueda de especialización para decidir a quién contactar al buscar experiencia en un área en particular. Ejemplos de tal contexto son: ¿Con quién trabaja ella? ¿Cuáles son sus datos de contacto? ¿Está bien conectada, en caso de que no pueda ayudarnos a sí misma? ¿Cuál es su papel en la organización? ¿Quién es su superior? Los colaboradores y las afiliaciones, etc. son parte del perfil social de los candidatos, y pueden servir como antecedentes contra los cuales se deben interpretar las recomendaciones de los sistemas. En este artículo solo abordamos el problema de determinar los perfiles tópicos y dejamos el perfil social para más trabajo. Afirmamos el problema de cuantificar la competencia de una persona en un área de conocimiento determinada de la siguiente manera: ¿Cuál es la probabilidad de que un área de conocimiento (KI) sea parte del perfil de candidatos (experiencia)?donde S (Ca, Ki) se define por P (Ki | Ca). Nuestra tarea, entonces, es estimar P (Ki | Ca), que es equivalente al problema de obtener P (Q | Ca), donde el tema Ki se representa como un tema de consulta Q, es decir, una secuencia de palabras clave que representan lasSe requiere experiencia. Tanto las tareas de hallazgo de expertos y perfiles se basan en la estimación precisa de P (Q | Ca). La única diferencia deriva de la probabilidad previa de que una persona sea un experto (P (CA)), que puede incorporarse a la tarea de búsqueda de expertos. Este anterior no se aplica a la tarea de perfiles ya que el candidato (individual) es fijo.4. Modelos de referencia En esta sección describimos nuestros modelos de referencia para estimar P (Q | Ca), es decir, asociaciones entre temas y personas. Tanto el hallazgo experto como el perfil de expertos se reducen a esta estimación. Empleamos tres modelos para calcular esta probabilidad.4.1 Desde temas hasta candidatos que usan modelos candidatos: Modelo 1 Modelo 1 [4] Define la probabilidad de una consulta dada un candidato (P (P (Q | CA)) utilizando técnicas de modelado de lenguaje estándar, basado en un modelo de lenguaje unigram multinomial. Para cada CA candidato, se infiere un modelo de lenguaje candidato θca de tal manera que la probabilidad de un término dado θca no es cero para todos los términos, es decir, p (t | θca)> 0. Del modelo candidato, la consulta se genera con la siguiente probabilidad: p (q | θca) = y t∈Q p (t | θca) n (t, q), donde cada término t en la consulta q se muestrea de manera ideal e independiente,y n (t, q) es el número de veces que ocurre en q. El modelo de idioma candidato se infiere de la siguiente manera: (1) se calcula un modelo empírico P (t | Ca);(2) Se suaviza con probabilidades de fondo. Usando las asociaciones entre un candidato y un documento, la probabilidad P (T | Ca) puede ser aproximada por: P (T | Ca) = X D P (T | D) P (D | Ca), donde P (D | Ca) es la probabilidad de que la CA candidata genera un documento de apoyo D, y P (t | d) es la probabilidad de que un término t ocurra en el documento d.Utilizamos la estimación de máxima verosimilitud de un término, es decir, la frecuencia normalizada del término t en el documento d.La fortaleza de la asociación entre el documento D y el candidato CA expresado por P (D | Ca) refleja el grado en que se describe la experiencia de los candidatos utilizando este documento. La estimación de esta probabilidad se presenta más tarde, en la Sección 4.2. El modelo candidato se construye como una interpolación lineal de P (t | Ca) y el modelo de fondo P (t) para garantizar que no haya probabilidades cero, lo que resulta en la estimación final: P (Q | θca) = (4)Y t∈Q ((1 - λ) x d p (t | d) p (d | ca)! + Λp (t)) n (t, q). El Modelo 1 acumula toda la información a término de todos los documentos asociados con el candidato, y utiliza esto para representar a ese candidato. Este modelo se utiliza para predecir cómo un candidato produce una consulta q. Esto puede interpretarse intuitivamente como la probabilidad de que este candidato hable sobre el tema de la consulta, donde suponemos que esto es indicativo de su experiencia. Uso de modelos de documentos: Modelo 2 Modelo 2 [4] adopta un enfoque diferente. Aquí, el proceso se divide en dos partes. Dado un candidato, CA, (1) un documento asociado con un candidato se selecciona con probabilidad P (D | Ca), y (2) de este documento se genera una consulta Q con probabilidad P (Q | D). Luego, la suma sobre todos los documentos se toma para obtener P (Q | Ca), de modo que: P (Q | Ca) = X D P (Q | D) P (D | Ca).(5) La probabilidad de una consulta dada un documento se estima inferiendo un modelo de lenguaje de documento θd para cada documento D de manera similar al que se infiere el modelo candidato: P (t | θd) = (1 - λ) P (T| d) + λp (t), (6) donde p (t | d) es la probabilidad del término en el documento. La probabilidad de una consulta dada el modelo de documento es: P (q | θd) = y t∈Q p (t | θd) n (t, q). La estimación final de P (Q | Ca) se obtiene sustituyendo P (Q | D) por P (Q | θd) en la ecuación.5 (ver [4] para obtener detalles completos). Conceptualmente, el Modelo 2 difiere del Modelo 1 porque el candidato no está modelado directamente. En cambio, el documento actúa como una variable oculta en el proceso que separa la consulta del candidato. Este proceso es similar a cómo un usuario puede buscar candidatos con un motor de búsqueda estándar: inicialmente encontrando los documentos que son relevantes y luego viendo quién está asociado con ese documento. Al examinar una serie de documentos, el usuario puede obtener una idea de qué candidatos es más probable que discutan el tema q. Uso de modelos de temas: Modelo 3 Introducimos un tercer modelo, Modelo 3. En lugar de intentar modelar el proceso de generación de consultas a través de modelos candidatos o de documentos, representamos la consulta como un modelo de lenguaje temático y estimamos directamente la probabilidad del candidato P (CA | Q). Este enfoque es similar al modelo presentado en [3, 19]. Al igual que con los modelos anteriores, se infiere un modelo de idioma, pero esta vez para la consulta. Adaptamos el trabajo de Lavrenko y Croft [14] para estimar un modelo de tema de la consulta. El procedimiento es el siguiente. Dada una colección de documentos y un tema de consulta Q, se supone que existe un modelo de tema desconocido θk que asigna probabilidades P (t | θk) al término ocurrencias en los documentos del tema. Tanto la consulta como los documentos son muestras de θk (a diferencia de los enfoques anteriores, donde se supone que una consulta se muestrean de un documento específico o modelo candidato). La tarea principal es estimar p (t | θk), la probabilidad de un término dado el modelo de tema. Dado que la consulta Q es muy escasa, y como no hay ejemplos de documentos sobre el tema, esta distribución debe ser aproximada. Lavrenko y Croft [14] sugieren una forma razonable de obtener dicha aproximación, suponiendo que P (t | θk) puede aproximarse por la probabilidad de término t dada la consulta q. Luego podemos estimar p (t | q) usando la probabilidad conjunta de observar el término t junto con los términos de consulta, Q1 ,..., QM, y dividiendo por la probabilidad conjunta de los términos de consulta: p (t | θk) ≈ P (t | q) = p (t, q1, .., qm) p (q1, .., qm)= p (t, q1, ..., qm) p t ∈T p (t, q1, ..., qm), donde p (q1, ..., qm) = p t ∈T p (t,Q1, ..., QM), y T es todo el vocabulario de los términos. Para estimar la probabilidad conjunta P (T, Q1, ..., QM), seguimos [14, 15] y asumimos T y Q1 ,..., QM son mutuamente independientes, una vez que elegimos una distribución de fuente del conjunto de distribuciones de fuente subyacentes U. Si elegimos que seas un conjunto de modelos de documentos.Luego, para construir este conjunto, la consulta Q se emitiría contra la colección, y se supone que el N Top N devuelto es relevante para el tema y, por lo tanto, se trata como muestras del modelo de tema.(Tenga en cuenta que los modelos candidatos podrían usarse en su lugar). Con los modelos de documento que forman U, la probabilidad conjunta de términos y consulta se convierte en: P (T, Q1, ..., Qm) = x d∈U p (D) ˘ P (t | θd) mi i = 1 p (qi | θd) ¯.(7) Aquí, P (d) denota la distribución previa sobre el conjunto U, que refleja la relevancia del documento al tema. Suponemos que P (d) es uniforme en U. Para clasificar a los candidatos de acuerdo con el modelo de tema definido, utilizamos la métrica de divergencia de Kullback-Leiber (KL, [8]) para medir la diferencia entre los modelos candidatos y el modelo de tema: KL (θk || θca) = x T P(t | θk) log p (t | θk) p (t | θca).(8) Los candidatos con una divergencia más pequeña del modelo de tema se consideran más probables expertos en ese tema. El modelo candidato θca se define en la ecuación.4. Al usar la divergencia KL en lugar de la probabilidad de un candidato dado el modelo de tema P (CA | θk), evitamos los problemas de normalización.4.2 Asociaciones de documentos candidatos para nuestros modelos necesitamos poder estimar la probabilidad P (D | Ca), que expresa hasta qué punto un documento D caracteriza al candidato CA. En [4], se presentan dos métodos para estimar esta probabilidad, en función del número de nombres de personas reconocidos en un documento. Sin embargo, en nuestro entorno (intranet) es razonable suponer que los autores de los documentos pueden identificarse inequívocamente (por ejemplo, como autor de un artículo, el maestro asignado a un curso, el propietario de una página web, etc.) Por lo tanto, establecemos P (D | Ca) para que sea 1 si el candidato CA es el autor del documento D, de lo contrario, la probabilidad es 0. En la Sección 6 describimos cómo la autoría se puede determinar en diferentes tipos de documentos dentro de la colección.5. La colección de expertos UVT La colección UVT Expert utilizada en los experimentos en este documento se ajusta al escenario descrito en la Sección 3. La colección se basa en el sistema WebWijs (WebWise) desarrollado en la Universidad de Tilburg (UVT) en los Países Bajos. WebWijs (http://www.uvt.nl/ webwijs/) es una base de datos de acceso público de empleados UVT que participan en investigaciones o enseñanza;Actualmente, WebWIJS contiene información sobre 1168 expertos, cada uno de los cuales tiene una página con información de contacto y, si el experto, está disponible por el experto, una lista de descripción de la investigación y una lista de publicaciones. Además, cada experto puede seleccionar áreas de experiencia de una lista de 1491 temas y se recomienda a sugerir nuevos temas que el editor de WebWIJS deba aprobar. Cada tema tiene una página separada que muestra a todos los expertos asociados con ese tema y, si está disponible, una lista de temas relacionados. WebWijs está disponible en holandés e inglés, y esta bilingüidad se ha conservado en la colección. Cada página de WebWijs holandesa tiene una traducción al inglés. No todos los temas holandeses tienen una traducción al inglés, pero lo contrario es cierto: los 981 temas en inglés tienen un equivalente holandés. Alrededor del 42% de los expertos enseñan cursos en la Universidad de Tilburg;Estos cursos también se rastrearon e incluyeron en el perfil. Además, alrededor del 27% de los expertos se vinculan a su página de inicio académica desde su página de WebWijs. Estas páginas de inicio se arrastraron y se agregaron a la colección.(Esto significa que si los expertos colocaron las versiones de texto completo de sus publicaciones en su página de inicio académico, estas también estaban disponibles para la indexación). También obtuvimos 1880 versiones de texto completo de publicaciones del repositorio institucional UVT e inglés holandés no.de expertos 1168 1168 no.de expertos con ≥ 1 tema 743 727 no.de temas 1491 981 no.de pares de expertos en el tema 4318 3251 avg.No.de temas/experto 5.8 5.9 Máx.No.de temas/expertos (no. de expertos) 60 (1) 35 (1) min.No.de temas/expertos (no. de expertos) 1 (74) 1 (106) avg.No.de expertos/tema 2.9 3.3 Máx.No.de expertos/tema (no. de temas) 30 (1) 30 (1) min.No.de expertos/tema (no. de temas) 1 (615) 1 (346) no.de expertos con HP 318 318 no.de expertos con CD 318 318 AVG.No.de CDS por experto en enseñanza 3.5 3.5 no.de expertos con RD 329 313 no.de expertos con pub 734 734 avg.No.de pubs por experto 27.0 27.0 avg.No.de citas de pub por experto 25.2 25.2 AVG.No.de pubs de texto completo por experto 1.8 1.8 Tabla 2: Estadísticas descriptivas de las versiones holandesas e inglesas de la colección de expertos UVT.los convirtió en texto plano. Ejecutamos el identificador de lenguaje TextCat [23] para clasificar el idioma de las páginas de inicio y las publicaciones de texto completo. Nos restringimos a las páginas donde el clasificador confiaba en el idioma utilizado en la página. Esto dio como resultado cuatro tipos de documentos: descripciones de investigación (RD), descripciones de cursos (CD), publicaciones (pub; versiones de texto completo y citionOnly) y páginas de inicio académicas (HP). Todo fue incluido en la colección UVT Expert que está disponible en http: //ilk.uvt.nl/uvt-expert-collection/. La colección UVT Expert se extrajo de un entorno organizacional diferente al de la colección W3C y difiere de ella de varias maneras. La configuración UVT es una con cantidades relativamente pequeñas de datos multilingües. Las asociaciones de autor del documento son claras y los datos están estructurados y limpios. La colección cubre una amplia gama de áreas de experiencia, ya que generalmente se puede encontrar en intranets de universidades y otros institutos intensivos en conocimiento. Además, nuestro entorno universitario presenta varios tipos de estructura (tópica y organizacional), así como múltiples tipos de documentos. Otra diferencia importante entre los dos conjuntos de datos es que las áreas de experiencia en la recopilación de expertos UVT están autoseleccionadas en lugar de basarse en la membresía del grupo o las tareas por parte de otros. El tamaño es otra dimensión a lo largo de la cual difieren las colecciones de expertos W3C y UVT: esta última es la más pequeña de los dos. También son realistas las grandes diferencias en la cantidad de información disponible para cada experto. La utilización de WebWIJS es voluntario;425 expertos holandeses no seleccionaron ningún temas en absoluto. Esto nos deja con 743 perfiles de expertos utilizables en inglés y 727 en inglés. La Tabla 2 proporciona estadísticas descriptivas para la colección de expertos UVT. Las universidades tienden a tener una estructura jerárquica que va desde el nivel de la facultad, a los departamentos, grupos de investigación, a los investigadores individuales. En la colección de expertos UVT tenemos información sobre las afiliaciones de los investigadores con facultades e institutos, proporcionándonos una jerarquía organizacional de dos niveles. La Universidad de Tilburg tiene 22 unidades organizativas a nivel de facultad (incluida la oficina universitaria y varios institutos de investigación) y 71 departamentos, lo que equivale a 3.2 departamentos por facultad. En cuanto a la jerarquía tópica utilizada por WebWijs, 131 de los temas de 1491 son nodos principales en la jerarquía. Esta jerarquía tiene una longitud promedio de la cadena de temas de 2.65 y una longitud máxima de 7 temas.6. Evaluación a continuación, evaluamos los modelos de la Sección 4S para la búsqueda y el perfil de expertos en la recolección de expertos UVT. Detaltamos nuestras preguntas de investigación y la configuración experimental, y luego presentamos nuestros resultados.6.1 Preguntas de investigación abordamos las siguientes preguntas de investigación. Tanto el hallazgo experto como el perfil dependen de las estimaciones de P (Q | Ca). La pregunta es cómo se comparan los modelos en las diferentes tareas y en el entorno de la colección de expertos UVT. En [4], el Modelo 2 superó el Modelo 1 en la colección W3C. ¿Cómo se comparan en nuestro conjunto de datos? ¿Y cómo se compara el Modelo 3 con el Modelo 1? ¿Qué pasa con las diferencias de rendimiento entre los dos idiomas en nuestra colección de pruebas?6.2 Configuración experimental La salida de nuestros modelos se evaluó con las etiquetas de temas autoasignadas, que fueron tratadas como juicios de relevancia. Los resultados se evaluaron por separado para inglés y holandés. Para inglés solo usamos temas para los cuales la traducción holandesa estaba disponible;Para los holandeses se consideraron todos los temas. Los resultados se promediaron para las consultas en la intersección de juicios y resultados de relevancia;Las consultas faltantes no contribuyen con un valor de 0 a los puntajes. Utilizamos medidas de recuperación de información estándar, como la precisión promedio media (MAP) y el rango recíproco medio (MRR). También informamos el porcentaje de temas (%Q) y candidatos (%CA) cubiertos, para las tareas de hallazgo y perfiles de expertos, respectivamente.6.3 Resultados La Tabla 1 muestra el rendimiento del modelo 1, 2 y 3 en las tareas de hallazgo y perfiles de expertos. Las filas de la tabla corresponden a los diversos tipos de documentos (RD, CD, PUB y HP) y a sus combinaciones. RD+CD+PUB+HP es equivalente a la colección completa y se denominará la línea de base de nuestros experimentos. Mirando la Tabla 1, vemos que el Modelo 2 funciona mejor en todos los ámbitos. Sin embargo, cuando los datos están limpios y muy enfocados (RD), el Modelo 3 lo supera en varios casos. El Modelo 1 tiene la mejor cobertura de candidatos (%CA) y temas (%Q). Los diversos tipos de documentos difieren en sus características y cómo mejoran las tareas de hallazgo y perfil. El perfil de expertos se beneficia mucho de los datos limpios presentes en los tipos de documentos RD y CD, mientras que las publicaciones contribuyen más a la tarea de búsqueda de expertos. Agregar las páginas de inicio no demuestra ser particularmente útil. Cuando comparamos los resultados en todos los idiomas, encontramos que la cobertura de los temas de inglés (%Q) es más alta que la de los holandeses para el hallazgo experto. Además de eso, los puntajes caen en el mismo rango para ambos idiomas. Para la tarea de perfiles, la cobertura de los candidatos (%CA) es muy similar para ambos idiomas. Sin embargo, el rendimiento es sustancialmente mejor para los temas en inglés. Si bien es difícil comparar los puntajes en las colecciones, concluimos con una breve comparación de las puntuaciones absolutas en la Tabla 1 con las reportadas en [3, 4] en el conjunto de pruebas W3C (edición 2005). Para la búsqueda de expertos, las puntuaciones del MAP para el Modelo 2 informados aquí son aproximadamente un 50% más altos que las cifras correspondientes en [4], mientras que nuestras puntuaciones MRR están ligeramente por debajo de las de [4]. Para el perfil experto, las diferencias son mucho más dramáticas: las puntuaciones del mapa para el Modelo 2 informados aquí están alrededor del 50% por debajo de los puntajes en [3], mientras que las (mejores) puntajes MRR son casi las mismas que las de [3]. La causa de estas últimas diferencias parece residir en el número de áreas de conocimiento consideradas aquí.30 veces más que en la configuración W3C.7. Modelos avanzados Ahora que hemos desarrollado y evaluado técnicas básicas de modelado de idiomas para la recuperación de experiencia, recurrimos a modelos refinados que explotan características especiales de nuestra colección de pruebas.7.1 Explotar la similitud del área de conocimiento Una forma de mejorar la puntuación de una consulta dada un candidato es considerar qué otras solicitudes el candidato satisfaría y usarlas como evidencia adicional para respaldar la consulta original, expertos proporcionales que encuentran tipos de documentos de perfiles expertos Modelo 1 Modelo 2Model 3 Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 %q MAP MRR %q MAP MRR %q MAP MRR %ca MAP MRR %ca MAP MRR %ca MAP MRR English RD 97.8 0.126 0.269 83.5 0.144 0.311 83.3 0.129 0.271 100 0.089 0.189 39.3 0.232 0.465 41.10.166 0.337 CD 97.8 0.118 0.227 91.7 0.123 0.248 91.7 0.118 0.226 32.8 0.188 0.381 32.4 0.195 0.385 32.7 0.203 0.370 Pub 97.8 0.200 0.330 98.0 0.216. 0.212 0.442 78.9 0.135 0.299 hp 97.8 0.081 0.186 97.4 0.071 0.168 97.2 0.062 0.14931.2 0.150 0.299 28.8 0.185 0.335 30.1 0.136 0.287 Rd+CD 97.8 0.188 0.352 92.9 0.193 0.360 92.9 0.150 0.273 100 0.145 0.286 61.3 0.251 0.477 63.2 0.217 0.416 RD+CD+CD+CD+PUB 97. 77 0.439 98.1 0.178 0.305 100 0.196 0.380 87.2 0.280 0.53389.5 0.170 0.344 RD+CD+PUB+HP 97.8 0.237 0.372 98.6 0.280 0.441 98.5 0.166 0.293 100 0.199 0.387 88.7 0.281 0.525 90.9 0.169 0.329 Dutch Rd 61.3 0.094 0.229 38. 0.295 38.0 0.127 0.386 34.1 0.138 0.420 38.0 0.105 0.327 CD 61.30.107 0.212 49.7 0.128 0.256 49.7 0.136 0.261 32.5 0.151 0.389 31.8 0.158 0.396 32.5 0.170 0.380 pub 61.3 0.193 0.319 59.5 0.218 0.368 59.4 0.173 0.291 78.8 0.126 0.319 59.5 0.218 0.368 59.4 0.173 0.291 78.8 0.126 0.319 59.5.8.0. 103 0.294 hp 61.3 0.063 0.169 56.6 0.064 0.175 56.4 0.062 0.163 29.8 0.108 0.308 27.80.125 0.338 29.8 0.098 0.255 Rd+CD 61.3 0.159 0.314 51.9 0.184 0.360 51.9 0.169 0.324 60.5 0.151 0.410 57.2 0.166 0.431 60.4 0.159 0.384 RD+CD+PUB 61.3 0.244 0.310 61. 4 0.210 0.350 90.3 0.165 0.445 88.2 0.189 0.479 90.3 0.126 0.339 rd+CD+PUB+HP 61.3 0.249 0.401 62.6 0.265 0.436 62.6 0.195 0.344 91.9 0.164 0.426 90.1 0.195 0.488 91.9 0.125 0.328 Tabla 1: rendimiento de los modelos de hallazgo experto y perfilas, utilizando diferencias y sus combinaciones.%Q es el número de temas cubiertos (se aplica a la tarea de búsqueda de expertos), %CA es el número de candidatos cubiertos (se aplica a la tarea de perfiles de expertos). Los bloques superior e inferior corresponden al inglés y a los holandeses respectivamente. Los mejores puntajes están en negrita.a cuán relacionadas están las otras solicitudes con la consulta original. Esto se puede modelar interpolando entre P (Q | Ca) y la evidencia de apoyo adicional de todas las solicitudes similar Q, de la siguiente manera: P (Q | Ca) = λp (Q | Ca) + (1 - λ) x Q P (Q | Q) P (Q | Ca), (9) donde P (Q | Q) representa la similitud entre los dos temas q y q. Para poder trabajar con métodos de similitud que no son necesariamente probabilidades, establecemos P (Q | Q) = W (Q, Q) γ, donde γ es una constante de normalización, de modo que γ = P Q W (Q, Q). Consideramos cuatro métodos para calcular la puntuación de similitud entre dos temas. Tres enfoques se basan estrictamente en el contenido y establecen una similitud al examinar los patrones de temas de concurrencia dentro de la colección, mientras que el último enfoque explota la estructura jerárquica de las áreas tópicas que pueden estar presentes dentro de una organización (ver [7] para ver más allá de otros ejemplos de más.integrar relaciones de palabras en modelos de lenguaje). La métrica de divergencia Kullback-Leibler (KL) definida en la ecuación.8 proporciona una medida de cuán diferentes o dos o similares son dos distribuciones de probabilidad. Se infiere un modelo de tema para Q y Q utilizando el método presentado en la Sección 4.1 para describir la consulta en todo el vocabulario. Dado que una puntuación KL más baja significa que las consultas son más similares, dejamos w (Q, Q) = max (kl (θq || ·) - kl (θq || θq)). La información mutua de puntos (PMI, [17]) es una medida de asociación utilizada en la teoría de la información para determinar el alcance de la independencia entre las variables. La dependencia entre dos consultas se refleja en la puntuación SI (Q, Q), donde las puntuaciones superiores a cero indican que es probable que exista una dependencia, lo que consideramos que es probable que las consultas sean similares: Si (Q, q) = log p (q, q) p (q) p (q) (10) Estimamos la probabilidad de un tema p (q) utilizando el número de documentos relevantes para la consulta Q dentro de la colección. La probabilidad conjunta P (Q, Q) se estima de manera similar, utilizando la concatenación de Q y Q como consulta. Para obtener p (q | q), luego establecemos w (q, q) = si (q, q) cuando si (q, q)> 0 de lo contrario w (q, q) = 0, porque solo estamos interesados enincluyendo consultas que son similares. La estadística de la probabilidad log proporciona otra medida de dependencia, que es más confiable que la medida de información mutua puntual [17]. Sea K1 el número de coincidencias de Q y Q, K2. El número de ocurrencias de Q no co-ocurriendo con Q, N1 El número total de ocurrencias de Q y N2 el número total de tokens de tema menos el número de ocurrenciasde q. Entonces, deje p1 = k1/n1, p2 = k2/n2 y p = (k1 + k2)/(n1 + n2), (q, q) = 2 ((p1, k1, n1) + (p2, k2, n2) - (p, k1, n1) - (p, k2, n2)), donde (p, n, k) = k log p + (n - k) log (1 - p). La puntuación más alta indica que también es probable que las consultas sean similares, por lo tanto, establecemos W (Q, Q) = (Q, Q). Finalmente, también estimamos la similitud de dos temas basados en su distancia dentro de la jerarquía del tema. La jerarquía del tema se ve como un gráfico dirigido, y para todos los pares de tema se calcula la ruta más corta SP (Q, Q). Establecemos la puntuación de similitud para ser el recíproco de la ruta más corta: W (Q, Q) = 1/SP (Q, Q).7.2 Información contextual dada la jerarquía de una organización, las unidades a las que pertenece una persona se consideran un contexto para compensar la escasez de datos. Lo modelamos de la siguiente manera: P (Q | Ca) = 1 - P o∈U (Ca) λou · P (Q | Ca) + P o∈U (ca) λou · p (q | ou), donde ou (Ca) es el conjunto de unidades organizativas de las cuales CA CAY es miembro de, y P (Q | O) expresa la fuerza de la asociación entre la consulta Q y la unidad OU. La última probabilidad se puede estimar utilizando cualquiera de los tres modelos básicos, simplemente reemplazando CA con OU en las ecuaciones correspondientes. Una unidad organizativa está asociada con todos los documentos que sus miembros han escrito. Es decir, p (d | ou) = maxca∈U p (d | ca).7.3 Un modelo multilingüe simple para institutos de conocimiento en Europa, académicos o de otro tipo, un entorno multilingüe (o al menos bilingüe) es típico. El siguiente modelo se basa en una especie de suposición de independencia: no hay derrames de experiencia/perfiles en los límites del lenguaje. Si bien es una simplificación, este es un primer enfoque sensato. Es decir: P (Q | Ca) = P l∈L λl · P (Ql | Ca), donde L es el conjunto de idiomas utilizados en la colección, Ql es la traducción de la consulta Q al idioma L, y λl IS esUn parámetro de suavizado específico del lenguaje, de modo que p l∈L λl = 1. 8.

Además, ¿es útil nuestra forma de obtener información contextual? ¿Para qué tareas? Y finalmente, ¿es nuestra forma simple de combinar las puntuaciones monolingües suficientes para obtener mejoras significativas?8.2 Configuración experimental Dada que las autoevaluaciones también son escasas en nuestra colección, para poder medir las diferencias entre los diversos modelos, seleccionamos un subconjunto de temas y evaluamos (algunos de los) ejecutados solo en este subconjunto. Este conjunto se conoce como temas principales y consiste en temas ubicados en el nivel superior de la jerarquía tópica.(Un tema principal tiene subtemas, pero no es una subtópica de ningún otro tema). Este conjunto principal consta de 132 temas holandeses y 119 ingleses. Los juicios de relevancia estaban restringidos al conjunto de temas principales, pero no se expandieron con los subtópicos.8.3 Explotación del área de conocimiento La Tabla 4 presenta los resultados. Los cuatro métodos utilizados para estimar la similitud del área de conocimiento son Divergencia KL (KLDIV), Pointlang.

Logramos mejorar la línea de base en todos los casos, pero la mejora es más notable para la tarea de perfil. Para ambas tareas, el método LL funcionó mejor. Los enfoques basados en el contenido funcionaron consistentemente mejor que HDIST.8.4 Información contextual Una jerarquía de dos niveles de unidades organizacionales (facultades e institutos) está disponible en la colección de expertos UVT. La unidad a la que pertenece una persona se usa como un contexto para esa persona. Primero, evaluamos los modelos de las unidades organizacionales, utilizando todos los temas (todos) y solo los principales temas (principales). Se considera que una unidad organizativa es relevante para un tema determinado (o viceversa) si al menos un miembro de la unidad seleccionó el tema dado como un área de experiencia. La Tabla 5 informa sobre los resultados. En cuanto al hallazgo de expertos, dado un tema, la unidad organizativa correspondiente puede identificarse con alta precisión. Sin embargo, la tarea de perfiles expertos muestra una imagen diferente: los puntajes son bajos y la tarea parece difícil. La explicación puede ser que los conceptos generales (es decir, nuestros principales temas) pueden pertenecer a varias unidades organizacionales. En segundo lugar, realizamos otra evaluación, donde combinamos los modelos contextuales con los modelos candidatos (para anotar los candidatos nuevamente). La Tabla 6 informa sobre los resultados. Encontramos un impacto positivo de los modelos de contexto solo para el hallazgo de expertos. Notablemente, para el hallazgo de expertos (y el modelo 1), mejora más del 50% (para inglés) y más del 70% (para holandés) en el mapa. El bajo rendimiento en el perfil de expertos puede deberse al hecho de que los modelos de contexto por sí solos no funcionaban muy bien en la tarea de perfil para empezar.8.5 Modelos multilingües En esta subsección evaluamos el método para combinar los resultados en múltiples idiomas que describimos en la Sección 7.3. En nuestro entorno, el conjunto de idiomas consiste en inglés y holandés: L = {Reino Unido, NL}. Los pesos en estos idiomas se establecieron para ser idénticos (λuk = λnl = 0.5). Realizamos experimentos con varias configuraciones λ, pero no observamos diferencias significativas en el rendimiento. La Tabla 3 informa sobre los resultados multilingües, donde el rendimiento se evalúa en el conjunto de temas completos. Los tres modelos significativamente Imlang.

Conclusiones En este artículo nos centramos en la recuperación de experiencia (hallazgo de expertos y perfiles) en un nuevo entorno de una organización típica intensiva en conocimiento en la que los datos disponibles son de alta calidad, multilingües y que cubren una amplia gama de área de experiencia. Por lo general, la cantidad de datos disponibles en dicha organización (por ejemplo, una universidad, un instituto de investigación o un laboratorio de investigación) es limitada en comparación con la colección W3C que se ha utilizado principalmente para la evaluación experimental de la recuperación de experiencia hasta ahora. Para examinar la recuperación de experiencia en este entorno, presentamos (y lanzamos) la colección de expertos UVT como un caso representativo de tales organizaciones intensivas de conocimiento. La nueva colección refleja las propiedades típicas de los institutos intensivos en conocimiento mencionados anteriormente y también incluye varias características que pueden ser potencialmente útiles para la recuperación de experiencia, como la estructura tópica y organizativa. Evaluamos cómo se realizaron modelos actuales de vanguardia para la búsqueda y perfil de expertos en este nuevo entorno y luego refinamos estos modelos para tratar de explotar las diferentes características dentro del entorno de datos (lenguaje, topicalidad y estructura organizativa). Encontramos que los modelos actuales de recuperación de experiencia se generalizan bien a este nuevo entorno;Además, encontramos que refinar los modelos para explicar las diferencias resulta en mejoras significativas, lo que compensa los problemas causados por problemas de escasez de datos. El trabajo futuro incluye la creación de evaluaciones manuales de los perfiles generados automáticamente por los propios empleados, especialmente en los casos en que los empleados no han proporcionado un perfil ellos mismos.10.

        "INTRODUCTION An organizations intranet provides a means for exchanging information between employees and for facilitating employee collaborations.",
        "To efficiently and effectively achieve this, it is necessary to provide search facilities that enable employees not only to access documents, but also to identify expert colleagues.",
        "At the TREC Enterprise Track [22] the need to study and understand expertise retrieval has been recognized through the introduction of Expert Finding tasks.",
        "The goal of expert finding is to identify a list of people who are knowledgeable about a given topic.",
        "This task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between people and topics [10]; commonly, a co-occurrence of the name of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be evidence of expertise.",
        "An alternative task, which using the same idea of people-topic associations, is expert profiling, where the task is to return a list of topics that a person is knowledgeable about [3].",
        "The launch of the Expert Finding task at TREC has generated a lot of interest in expertise retrieval, with rapid progress being made in terms of modeling, algorithms, and evaluation aspects.",
        "However, nearly all of the expert finding or profiling work performed has been validated experimentally using the W3C collection [24] from the Enterprise Track.",
        "While this collection is currently the only publicly available test collection for expertise retrieval tasks, it only represents one type of intranet.",
        "With only one test collection it is not possible to generalize conclusions to other realistic settings.",
        "In this paper we focus on expertise retrieval in a realistic setting that differs from the W3C setting-one in which relatively small amounts of clean, multilingual data are available, that cover a broad range of expertise areas, as can be found on the intranets of universities and other knowledge-intensive organizations.",
        "Typically, this setting features several additional types of structure: topical structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization), organizational structure (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications, and academic homepages).",
        "This setting is quite different from the W3C setting in ways that might impact upon the performance of expertise retrieval tasks.",
        "We focus on a number of research questions in this paper: Does the relatively small amount of data available on an intranet affect the quality of the topic-person associations that lie at the heart of expertise retrieval algorithms?",
        "How do state-of-the-art algorithms developed on the W3C data set perform in the alternative scenario of the type described above?",
        "More generally, do the lessons from the Expert Finding task at TREC carry over to this setting?",
        "How does the inclusion or exclusion of different documents affect expertise retrieval tasks?",
        "In addition to, how can the topical and organizational structure be used for retrieval purposes?",
        "To answer our research questions, we first present a set of baseline approaches, based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding associations between topics and people.",
        "This allows us to formulate the expert finding and expert profiling tasks in a uniform way, and has the added benefit of allowing us to understand the relations between the two tasks.",
        "For our experimental evaluation, we introduce a new data set (the UvT Expert Collection) which is representative of the type of intranet that we described above.",
        "Our collection is based on publicly available data, crawled from the website of Tilburg University (UvT).",
        "This type of data is particularly interesting, since (1) it is clean, heterogeneous, structured, and focused, but comprises a limited number of documents; (2) contains information on the organizational hierarchy; (3) it is bilingual (English and Dutch); and (4) the list of expertise areas of an individual are provided by the employees themselves.",
        "Using the UvT Expert collection, we conduct two sets of experiments.",
        "The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise finding and profiling methods in this new setting.",
        "A second group of experiments is aimed at extensions of the baseline methods that exploit characteristic features of the UvT Expert Collection; specifically, we propose and evaluate refined expert finding and profiling methods that incorporate topicality and organizational structure.",
        "Apart from the research questions and data set that we contribute, our main contributions are as follows.",
        "The baseline models developed for expertise finding perform well on the new data set.",
        "While on the W3C setting the expert finding task appears to be more difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case.",
        "We find that profiling on the UvT data set is considerably more difficult than on the W3C set, which we believe is due to the large (but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling: about 1,500 for the UvT set, versus 50 in the W3C case.",
        "Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly improve retrieval performance.",
        "The best performing similarity measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the W3C (and other) settings as well.",
        "Finally, we demonstrate that the organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section we review related work.",
        "Then, in Section 3 we provide detailed descriptions of the expertise retrieval tasks that we address in this paper: expert finding and expert profiling.",
        "In Section 4 we present our baseline models, of which the performance is then assessed in Section 6 using the UvT data set that we introduce in Section 5.",
        "Advanced models exploiting specific features of our data are presented in Section 7 and evaluated in Section 8.",
        "We formulate our conclusions in Section 9. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
        "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
        "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
        "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
        "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
        "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
        "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
        "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
        "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
        "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
        "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
        "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
        "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
        "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
        "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
        "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
        "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
        "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
        "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
        "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
        "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
        "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
        "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
        "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
        "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
        "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
        "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
        "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
        "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
        "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
        "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
        "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
        "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
        "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
        "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
        "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
        "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
        "This is the candidates topical profile.",
        "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
        "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",
        "By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .",
        "A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).",
        "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
        "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.",
        "Examples of such context are: Who does she work with?",
        "What are her contact details?",
        "Is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself?",
        "What is her role in the organization?",
        "Who is her superior?",
        "Collaborators, and affiliations, etc. are all part of the candidates social profile, and can serve as a background against which the systems recommendations should be interpreted.",
        "In this paper we only address the problem of determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work.",
        "We state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: What is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidates (expertise) profile? where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca).",
        "Our task, then, is to estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required.",
        "Both the expert finding and profiling tasks rely on the accurate estimation of p(q|ca).",
        "The only difference derives from the prior probability that a person is an expert (p(ca)), which can be incorporated into the expert finding task.",
        "This prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 4.",
        "BASELINE MODELS In this section we describe our baseline models for estimating p(q|ca), i.e., associations between topics and people.",
        "Both expert finding and expert profiling boil down to this estimation.",
        "We employ three models for calculating this probability. 4.1 From topics to candidates Using Candidate Models: Model 1 Model 1 [4] defines the probability of a query given a candidate (p(q|ca)) using standard language modeling techniques, based on a multinomial unigram language model.",
        "For each candidate ca, a candidate language model θca is inferred such that the probability of a term given θca is nonzero for all terms, i.e., p(t|θca) > 0.",
        "From the candidate model the query is generated with the following probability: p(q|θca) = Y t∈q p(t|θca)n(t,q) , where each term t in the query q is sampled identically and independently, and n(t, q) is the number of times t occurs in q.",
        "The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.",
        "Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document.",
        "The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2.",
        "The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) .",
        "Model 1 amasses all the term information from all the documents associated with the candidate, and uses this to represent that candidate.",
        "This model is used to predict how likely a candidate would produce a query q.",
        "This can can be intuitively interpreted as the probability of this candidate talking about the query topic, where we assume that this is indicative of their expertise.",
        "Using Document Models: Model 2 Model 2 [4] takes a different approach.",
        "Here, the process is broken into two parts.",
        "Given a candidate ca, (1) a document that is associated with a candidate is selected with probability p(d|ca), and (2) from this document a query q is generated with probability p(q|d).",
        "Then the sum over all documents is taken to obtain p(q|ca), such that: p(q|ca) = X d p(q|d)p(d|ca). (5) The probability of a query given a document is estimated by inferring a document language model θd for each document d in a similar manner as the candidate model was inferred: p(t|θd) = (1 − λ)p(t|d) + λp(t), (6) where p(t|d) is the probability of the term in the document.",
        "The probability of a query given the document model is: p(q|θd) = Y t∈q p(t|θd)n(t,q) .",
        "The final estimate of p(q|ca) is obtained by substituting p(q|d) for p(q|θd) into Eq. 5 (see [4] for full details).",
        "Conceptually, Model 2 differs from Model 1 because the candidate is not directly modeled.",
        "Instead, the document acts like a hidden variable in the process which separates the query from the candidate.",
        "This process is akin to how a user may search for candidates with a standard search engine: initially by finding the documents which are relevant, and then seeing who is associated with that document.",
        "By examining a number of documents the user can obtain an idea of which candidates are more likely to discuss the topic q.",
        "Using Topic Models: Model 3 We introduce a third model, Model 3.",
        "Instead of attempting to model the query generation process via candidate or document models, we represent the query as a topic language model and directly estimate the probability of the candidate p(ca|q).",
        "This approach is similar to the model presented in [3, 19].",
        "As with the previous models, a language model is inferred, but this time for the query.",
        "We adapt the work of Lavrenko and Croft [14] to estimate a topic model from the query.",
        "The procedure is as follows.",
        "Given a collection of documents and a query topic q, it is assumed that there exists an unknown topic model θk that assigns probabilities p(t|θk) to the term occurrences in the topic documents.",
        "Both the query and the documents are samples from θk (as opposed to the previous approaches, where a query is assumed to be sampled from a specific document or candidate model).",
        "The main task is to estimate p(t|θk), the probability of a term given the topic model.",
        "Since the query q is very sparse, and as there are no examples of documents on the topic, this distribution needs to be approximated.",
        "Lavrenko and Croft [14] suggest a reasonable way of obtaining such an approximation, by assuming that p(t|θk) can be approximated by the probability of term t given the query q.",
        "We can then estimate p(t|q) using the joint probability of observing the term t together with the query terms, q1, . . . , qm, and dividing by the joint probability of the query terms: p(t|θk) ≈ p(t|q) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) p(q1, . . . , qm) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm) , where p(q1, . . . , qm) = P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm), and T is the entire vocabulary of terms.",
        "In order to estimate the joint probability p(t, q1, . . . , qm), we follow [14, 15] and assume t and q1, . . . , qm are mutually independent, once we pick a source distribution from the set of underlying source distributions U.",
        "If we choose U to be a set of document models. then to construct this set, the query q would be issued against the collection, and the top n returned are assumed to be relevant to the topic, and thus treated as samples from the topic model. (Note that candidate models could be used instead.)",
        "With the document models forming U, the joint probability of term and query becomes: p(t, q1, . . . , qm) = X d∈U p(d) ˘ p(t|θd) mY i=1 p(qi|θd) ¯ . (7) Here, p(d) denotes the prior distribution over the set U, which reflects the relevance of the document to the topic.",
        "We assume that p(d) is uniform across U.",
        "In order to rank candidates according to the topic model defined, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence metric (KL, [8]) to measure the difference between the candidate models and the topic model: KL(θk||θca) = X t p(t|θk) log p(t|θk) p(t|θca) . (8) Candidates with a smaller divergence from the topic model are considered to be more likely experts on that topic.",
        "The candidate model θca is defined in Eq. 4.",
        "By using KL divergence instead of the probability of a candidate given the topic model p(ca|θk), we avoid normalization problems. 4.2 Document-candidate associations For our models we need to be able to estimate the probability p(d|ca), which expresses the extent to which a document d characterizes the candidate ca.",
        "In [4], two methods are presented for estimating this probability, based on the number of person names recognized in a document.",
        "However, in our (intranet) setting it is reasonable to assume that authors of documents can unambiguously be identified (e.g., as the author of an article, the teacher assigned to a course, the owner of a web page, etc.)",
        "Hence, we set p(d|ca) to be 1 if candidate ca is author of document d, otherwise the probability is 0.",
        "In Section 6 we describe how authorship can be determined on different types of documents within the collection. 5.",
        "THE UVT EXPERT COLLECTION The UvT Expert collection used in the experiments in this paper fits the scenario outlined in Section 3.",
        "The collection is based on the Webwijs (Webwise) system developed at Tilburg University (UvT) in the Netherlands.",
        "Webwijs (http://www.uvt.nl/ webwijs/) is a publicly accessible database of UvT employees who are involved in research or teaching; currently, Webwijs contains information about 1168 experts, each of whom has a page with contact information and, if made available by the expert, a research description and publications list.",
        "In addition, each expert can select expertise areas from a list of 1491 topics and is encouraged to suggest new topics that need to be approved by the Webwijs editor.",
        "Each topic has a separate page that shows all experts associated with that topic and, if available, a list of related topics.",
        "Webwijs is available in Dutch and English, and this bilinguality has been preserved in the collection.",
        "Every Dutch Webwijs page has an English translation.",

        "Results were evaluated separately for English and Dutch.",
        "For English we only used topics for which the Dutch translation was available; for Dutch all topics were considered.",
        "The results were averaged for the queries in the intersection of relevance judgements and results; missing queries do not contribute a value of 0 to the scores.",
        "We use standard information retrieval measures, such as Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).",

        "Model 1 has the best coverage of candidates (%ca) and topics (%q).",
        "The various document types differ in their characteristics and how they improve the finding and profiling tasks.",
        "Expert profiling benefits much from the clean data present in the RD and CD document types, while the publications contribute the most to the expert finding task.",
        "Adding the homepages does not prove to be particularly useful.",
        "When we compare the results across languages, we find that the coverage of English topics (%q) is higher than of the Dutch ones for expert finding.",
        "Apart from that, the scores fall in the same range for both languages.",
        "For the profiling task the coverage of the candidates (%ca) is very similar for both languages.",
        "However, the performance is substantially better for the English topics.",
        "While it is hard to compare scores across collections, we conclude with a brief comparison of the absolute scores in Table 1 to those reported in [3, 4] on the W3C test set (2005 edition).",
        "For expert finding the MAP scores for Model 2 reported here are about 50% higher than the corresponding figures in [4], while our MRR scores are slightly below those in [4].",
        "For expert profiling, the differences are far more dramatic: the MAP scores for Model 2 reported here are around 50% below the scores in [3], while the (best) MRR scores are about the same as those in [3].",

                "At the TREC Enterprise Track [22] the need to study and understand expertise retrieval has been recognized through the introduction of Expert Finding tasks.",
                "The goal of expert finding is to identify a list of people who are knowledgeable about a given topic.",
                "This task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between people and topics [10]; commonly, a co-occurrence of the name of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be evidence of expertise.",

                "Typically, this setting features several additional types of structure: topical structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization), organizational structure (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications, and academic homepages).",
                "This setting is quite different from the W3C setting in ways that might impact upon the performance of expertise retrieval tasks.",

                "This allows us to formulate the expert finding and expert profiling tasks in a uniform way, and has the added benefit of allowing us to understand the relations between the two tasks.",

                "This type of data is particularly interesting, since (1) it is clean, heterogeneous, structured, and focused, but comprises a limited number of documents; (2) contains information on the organizational hierarchy; (3) it is bilingual (English and Dutch); and (4) the list of expertise areas of an individual are provided by the employees themselves.",
                "Using the UvT Expert collection, we conduct two sets of experiments.",

                "Apart from the research questions and data set that we contribute, our main contributions are as follows.",
                "The baseline models developed for expertise finding perform well on the new data set.",
                "While on the W3C setting the expert finding task appears to be more difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case.",
                "We find that profiling on the UvT data set is considerably more difficult than on the W3C set, which we believe is due to the large (but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling: about 1,500 for the UvT set, versus 50 in the W3C case.",
                "Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly improve retrieval performance.",
                "The best performing similarity measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the W3C (and other) settings as well.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that the organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In the next section we review related work.",
                "Then, in Section 3 we provide detailed descriptions of the expertise retrieval tasks that we address in this paper: expert finding and expert profiling.",
                "In Section 4 we present our baseline models, of which the performance is then assessed in Section 6 using the UvT data set that we introduce in Section 5.",
                "Advanced models exploiting specific features of our data are presented in Section 7 and evaluated in Section 8.",
                "We formulate our conclusions in Section 9. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
                "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",
                "By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .",
                "A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).",
                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.",
                "Examples of such context are: Who does she work with?",
                "What are her contact details?",
                "Is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself?",
                "What is her role in the organization?",
                "Who is her superior?",
                "Collaborators, and affiliations, etc. are all part of the candidates social profile, and can serve as a background against which the systems recommendations should be interpreted.",
                "In this paper we only address the problem of determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work.",
                "We state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: What is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidates (expertise) profile? where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca).",
                "Our task, then, is to estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required.",
                "Both the expert finding and profiling tasks rely on the accurate estimation of p(q|ca).",
                "The only difference derives from the prior probability that a person is an expert (p(ca)), which can be incorporated into the expert finding task.",
                "This prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 4.",
                "BASELINE MODELS In this section we describe our baseline models for estimating p(q|ca), i.e., associations between topics and people.",
                "Both expert finding and expert profiling boil down to this estimation.",
                "We employ three models for calculating this probability. 4.1 From topics to candidates Using Candidate Models: Model 1 Model 1 [4] defines the probability of a query given a candidate (p(q|ca)) using standard language modeling techniques, based on a multinomial unigram language model.",

                "We first present two main expertise retrieval tasks, along with a set of baseline approaches based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding expertise relations between topics and people.",
                "For our experimental evaluation, we introduce (and release) a new test set based on a crawl of a university site.",
                "Using this test set, we conduct two series of experiments.",
                "The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise retrieval methods applied to the new test set.",
                "The second is aimed at assessing refined models that exploit characteristic features of the new test set, such as the organizational structure of the university, and the hierarchical structure of the topics in the test set.",

                "INTRODUCTION An organizations intranet provides a means for exchanging information between employees and for facilitating employee collaborations.",
                "To efficiently and effectively achieve this, it is necessary to provide search facilities that enable employees not only to access documents, but also to identify expert colleagues.",
                "At the TREC Enterprise Track [22] the need to study and understand expertise retrieval has been recognized through the introduction of Expert Finding tasks.",
                "The goal of expert finding is to identify a list of people who are knowledgeable about a given topic.",
                "This task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between people and topics [10]; commonly, a co-occurrence of the name of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be evidence of expertise.",
                "An alternative task, which using the same idea of people-topic associations, is expert profiling, where the task is to return a list of topics that a person is knowledgeable about [3].",
                "The launch of the Expert Finding task at TREC has generated a lot of interest in expertise retrieval, with rapid progress being made in terms of modeling, algorithms, and evaluation aspects.",
                "However, nearly all of the expert finding or profiling work performed has been validated experimentally using the W3C collection [24] from the Enterprise Track.",
                "While this collection is currently the only publicly available test collection for expertise retrieval tasks, it only represents one type of intranet.",
                "With only one test collection it is not possible to generalize conclusions to other realistic settings.",
                "In this paper we focus on expertise retrieval in a realistic setting that differs from the W3C setting-one in which relatively small amounts of clean, multilingual data are available, that cover a broad range of expertise areas, as can be found on the intranets of universities and other knowledge-intensive organizations.",
                "Typically, this setting features several additional types of structure: topical structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization), organizational structure (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications, and academic homepages).",
                "This setting is quite different from the W3C setting in ways that might impact upon the performance of expertise retrieval tasks.",
                "We focus on a number of research questions in this paper: Does the relatively small amount of data available on an intranet affect the quality of the topic-person associations that lie at the heart of expertise retrieval algorithms?",
                "How do state-of-the-art algorithms developed on the W3C data set perform in the alternative scenario of the type described above?",
                "More generally, do the lessons from the Expert Finding task at TREC carry over to this setting?",
                "How does the inclusion or exclusion of different documents affect expertise retrieval tasks?",
                "In addition to, how can the topical and organizational structure be used for retrieval purposes?",
                "To answer our research questions, we first present a set of baseline approaches, based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding associations between topics and people.",
                "This allows us to formulate the expert finding and expert profiling tasks in a uniform way, and has the added benefit of allowing us to understand the relations between the two tasks.",
                "For our experimental evaluation, we introduce a new data set (the UvT Expert Collection) which is representative of the type of intranet that we described above.",
                "Our collection is based on publicly available data, crawled from the website of Tilburg University (UvT).",
                "This type of data is particularly interesting, since (1) it is clean, heterogeneous, structured, and focused, but comprises a limited number of documents; (2) contains information on the organizational hierarchy; (3) it is bilingual (English and Dutch); and (4) the list of expertise areas of an individual are provided by the employees themselves.",
                "Using the UvT Expert collection, we conduct two sets of experiments.",
                "The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise finding and profiling methods in this new setting.",
                "A second group of experiments is aimed at extensions of the baseline methods that exploit characteristic features of the UvT Expert Collection; specifically, we propose and evaluate refined expert finding and profiling methods that incorporate topicality and organizational structure.",
                "Apart from the research questions and data set that we contribute, our main contributions are as follows.",
                "The baseline models developed for expertise finding perform well on the new data set.",
                "While on the W3C setting the expert finding task appears to be more difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case.",
                "We find that profiling on the UvT data set is considerably more difficult than on the W3C set, which we believe is due to the large (but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling: about 1,500 for the UvT set, versus 50 in the W3C case.",
                "Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly improve retrieval performance.",
                "The best performing similarity measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the W3C (and other) settings as well.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that the organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In the next section we review related work.",
                "Then, in Section 3 we provide detailed descriptions of the expertise retrieval tasks that we address in this paper: expert finding and expert profiling.",
                "In Section 4 we present our baseline models, of which the performance is then assessed in Section 6 using the UvT data set that we introduce in Section 5.",
                "Advanced models exploiting specific features of our data are presented in Section 7 and evaluated in Section 8.",
                "We formulate our conclusions in Section 9. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
                "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",
                "By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .",
                "A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).",
                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.",
                "Examples of such context are: Who does she work with?",
                "What are her contact details?",
                "Is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself?",
                "What is her role in the organization?",
                "Who is her superior?",
                "Collaborators, and affiliations, etc. are all part of the candidates social profile, and can serve as a background against which the systems recommendations should be interpreted.",
                "In this paper we only address the problem of determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work.",
                "We state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: What is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidates (expertise) profile? where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca).",
                "Our task, then, is to estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required.",
                "Both the expert finding and profiling tasks rely on the accurate estimation of p(q|ca).",
                "The only difference derives from the prior probability that a person is an expert (p(ca)), which can be incorporated into the expert finding task.",
                "This prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 4.",
                "BASELINE MODELS In this section we describe our baseline models for estimating p(q|ca), i.e., associations between topics and people.",
                "Both expert finding and expert profiling boil down to this estimation.",
                "We employ three models for calculating this probability. 4.1 From topics to candidates Using Candidate Models: Model 1 Model 1 [4] defines the probability of a query given a candidate (p(q|ca)) using standard language modeling techniques, based on a multinomial unigram language model.",
                "For each candidate ca, a candidate language model θca is inferred such that the probability of a term given θca is nonzero for all terms, i.e., p(t|θca) > 0.",
                "From the candidate model the query is generated with the following probability: p(q|θca) = Y t∈q p(t|θca)n(t,q) , where each term t in the query q is sampled identically and independently, and n(t, q) is the number of times t occurs in q.",
                "The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.",
                "Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document.",
                "The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2.",
                "The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) .",
                "Model 1 amasses all the term information from all the documents associated with the candidate, and uses this to represent that candidate.",
                "This model is used to predict how likely a candidate would produce a query q.",
                "This can can be intuitively interpreted as the probability of this candidate talking about the query topic, where we assume that this is indicative of their expertise.",
                "Using Document Models: Model 2 Model 2 [4] takes a different approach.",
                "Here, the process is broken into two parts.",
                "Given a candidate ca, (1) a document that is associated with a candidate is selected with probability p(d|ca), and (2) from this document a query q is generated with probability p(q|d).",
                "Then the sum over all documents is taken to obtain p(q|ca), such that: p(q|ca) = X d p(q|d)p(d|ca). (5) The probability of a query given a document is estimated by inferring a document language model θd for each document d in a similar manner as the candidate model was inferred: p(t|θd) = (1 − λ)p(t|d) + λp(t), (6) where p(t|d) is the probability of the term in the document.",
                "The probability of a query given the document model is: p(q|θd) = Y t∈q p(t|θd)n(t,q) .",
                "The final estimate of p(q|ca) is obtained by substituting p(q|d) for p(q|θd) into Eq. 5 (see [4] for full details).",
                "Conceptually, Model 2 differs from Model 1 because the candidate is not directly modeled.",
                "Instead, the document acts like a hidden variable in the process which separates the query from the candidate.",
                "This process is akin to how a user may search for candidates with a standard search engine: initially by finding the documents which are relevant, and then seeing who is associated with that document.",
                "By examining a number of documents the user can obtain an idea of which candidates are more likely to discuss the topic q.",
                "Using Topic Models: Model 3 We introduce a third model, Model 3.",
                "Instead of attempting to model the query generation process via candidate or document models, we represent the query as a topic language model and directly estimate the probability of the candidate p(ca|q).",
                "This approach is similar to the model presented in [3, 19].",
                "As with the previous models, a language model is inferred, but this time for the query.",
                "We adapt the work of Lavrenko and Croft [14] to estimate a topic model from the query.",
                "The procedure is as follows.",
                "Given a collection of documents and a query topic q, it is assumed that there exists an unknown topic model θk that assigns probabilities p(t|θk) to the term occurrences in the topic documents.",
                "Both the query and the documents are samples from θk (as opposed to the previous approaches, where a query is assumed to be sampled from a specific document or candidate model).",
                "The main task is to estimate p(t|θk), the probability of a term given the topic model.",
                "Since the query q is very sparse, and as there are no examples of documents on the topic, this distribution needs to be approximated.",
                "Lavrenko and Croft [14] suggest a reasonable way of obtaining such an approximation, by assuming that p(t|θk) can be approximated by the probability of term t given the query q.",
                "We can then estimate p(t|q) using the joint probability of observing the term t together with the query terms, q1, . . . , qm, and dividing by the joint probability of the query terms: p(t|θk) ≈ p(t|q) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) p(q1, . . . , qm) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm) , where p(q1, . . . , qm) = P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm), and T is the entire vocabulary of terms.",
                "In order to estimate the joint probability p(t, q1, . . . , qm), we follow [14, 15] and assume t and q1, . . . , qm are mutually independent, once we pick a source distribution from the set of underlying source distributions U.",
                "If we choose U to be a set of document models. then to construct this set, the query q would be issued against the collection, and the top n returned are assumed to be relevant to the topic, and thus treated as samples from the topic model. (Note that candidate models could be used instead.)",
                "With the document models forming U, the joint probability of term and query becomes: p(t, q1, . . . , qm) = X d∈U p(d) ˘ p(t|θd) mY i=1 p(qi|θd) ¯ . (7) Here, p(d) denotes the prior distribution over the set U, which reflects the relevance of the document to the topic.",
                "We assume that p(d) is uniform across U.",
                "In order to rank candidates according to the topic model defined, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence metric (KL, [8]) to measure the difference between the candidate models and the topic model: KL(θk||θca) = X t p(t|θk) log p(t|θk) p(t|θca) . (8) Candidates with a smaller divergence from the topic model are considered to be more likely experts on that topic.",
                "The candidate model θca is defined in Eq. 4.",
                "By using KL divergence instead of the probability of a candidate given the topic model p(ca|θk), we avoid normalization problems. 4.2 Document-candidate associations For our models we need to be able to estimate the probability p(d|ca), which expresses the extent to which a document d characterizes the candidate ca.",
                "In [4], two methods are presented for estimating this probability, based on the number of person names recognized in a document.",
                "However, in our (intranet) setting it is reasonable to assume that authors of documents can unambiguously be identified (e.g., as the author of an article, the teacher assigned to a course, the owner of a web page, etc.)",
                "Hence, we set p(d|ca) to be 1 if candidate ca is author of document d, otherwise the probability is 0.",

                "For expert finding the MAP scores for Model 2 reported here are about 50% higher than the corresponding figures in [4], while our MRR scores are slightly below those in [4].",
                "For expert profiling, the differences are far more dramatic: the MAP scores for Model 2 reported here are around 50% below the scores in [3], while the (best) MRR scores are about the same as those in [3].",
                "The cause for the latter differences seems to reside in the number of knowledge areas considered here-approx. 30 times more than in the W3C setting. 7.",

                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",

[21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",

                "The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.",
                "Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document.",
                "The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2.",
                "The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) .",

                "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
                "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",
                "By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .",
                "A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).",
                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.",
                "Examples of such context are: Who does she work with?",
                "What are her contact details?",
                "Is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself?",
                "What is her role in the organization?",
                "Who is her superior?",
                "Collaborators, and affiliations, etc. are all part of the candidates social profile, and can serve as a background against which the systems recommendations should be interpreted.",
                "In this paper we only address the problem of determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work.",
                "We state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: What is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidates (expertise) profile? where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca).",
                "Our task, then, is to estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required.",
                "Both the expert finding and profiling tasks rely on the accurate estimation of p(q|ca).",
                "The only difference derives from the prior probability that a person is an expert (p(ca)), which can be incorporated into the expert finding task.",
                "This prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 4.",

                "From the candidate model the query is generated with the following probability: p(q|θca) = Y t∈q p(t|θca)n(t,q) , where each term t in the query q is sampled identically and independently, and n(t, q) is the number of times t occurs in q.",
                "The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.",
                "Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document.",
                "The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2.",
                "The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) .",
                "Model 1 amasses all the term information from all the documents associated with the candidate, and uses this to represent that candidate.",

                "Then the sum over all documents is taken to obtain p(q|ca), such that: p(q|ca) = X d p(q|d)p(d|ca). (5) The probability of a query given a document is estimated by inferring a document language model θd for each document d in a similar manner as the candidate model was inferred: p(t|θd) = (1 − λ)p(t|d) + λp(t), (6) where p(t|d) is the probability of the term in the document.",

                "The final estimate of p(q|ca) is obtained by substituting p(q|d) for p(q|θd) into Eq. 5 (see [4] for full details).",
                "Conceptually, Model 2 differs from Model 1 because the candidate is not directly modeled.",
                "Instead, the document acts like a hidden variable in the process which separates the query from the candidate.",
                "This process is akin to how a user may search for candidates with a standard search engine: initially by finding the documents which are relevant, and then seeing who is associated with that document.",

                "Both the query and the documents are samples from θk (as opposed to the previous approaches, where a query is assumed to be sampled from a specific document or candidate model).",
                "The main task is to estimate p(t|θk), the probability of a term given the topic model.",
                "Since the query q is very sparse, and as there are no examples of documents on the topic, this distribution needs to be approximated.",
                "Lavrenko and Croft [14] suggest a reasonable way of obtaining such an approximation, by assuming that p(t|θk) can be approximated by the probability of term t given the query q.",
                "We can then estimate p(t|q) using the joint probability of observing the term t together with the query terms, q1, . . . , qm, and dividing by the joint probability of the query terms: p(t|θk) ≈ p(t|q) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) p(q1, . . . , qm) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm) , where p(q1, . . . , qm) = P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm), and T is the entire vocabulary of terms.",

                "If we choose U to be a set of document models. then to construct this set, the query q would be issued against the collection, and the top n returned are assumed to be relevant to the topic, and thus treated as samples from the topic model. (Note that candidate models could be used instead.)",
                "With the document models forming U, the joint probability of term and query becomes: p(t, q1, . . . , qm) = X d∈U p(d) ˘ p(t|θd) mY i=1 p(qi|θd) ¯ . (7) Here, p(d) denotes the prior distribution over the set U, which reflects the relevance of the document to the topic.",

                "In order to rank candidates according to the topic model defined, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence metric (KL, [8]) to measure the difference between the candidate models and the topic model: KL(θk||θca) = X t p(t|θk) log p(t|θk) p(t|θca) . (8) Candidates with a smaller divergence from the topic model are considered to be more likely experts on that topic.",
                "The candidate model θca is defined in Eq. 4.",
                "By using KL divergence instead of the probability of a candidate given the topic model p(ca|θk), we avoid normalization problems. 4.2 Document-candidate associations For our models we need to be able to estimate the probability p(d|ca), which expresses the extent to which a document d characterizes the candidate ca.",
                "In [4], two methods are presented for estimating this probability, based on the number of person names recognized in a document.",
                "However, in our (intranet) setting it is reasonable to assume that authors of documents can unambiguously be identified (e.g., as the author of an article, the teacher assigned to a course, the owner of a web page, etc.)",

                "To efficiently and effectively achieve this, it is necessary to provide search facilities that enable employees not only to access documents, but also to identify expert colleagues.",
                "At the TREC Enterprise Track [22] the need to study and understand expertise retrieval has been recognized through the introduction of Expert Finding tasks.",
                "The goal of expert finding is to identify a list of people who are knowledgeable about a given topic.",
                "This task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between people and topics [10]; commonly, a co-occurrence of the name of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be evidence of expertise.",
                "An alternative task, which using the same idea of people-topic associations, is expert profiling, where the task is to return a list of topics that a person is knowledgeable about [3].",
                "The launch of the Expert Finding task at TREC has generated a lot of interest in expertise retrieval, with rapid progress being made in terms of modeling, algorithms, and evaluation aspects.",
                "However, nearly all of the expert finding or profiling work performed has been validated experimentally using the W3C collection [24] from the Enterprise Track.",
                "While this collection is currently the only publicly available test collection for expertise retrieval tasks, it only represents one type of intranet.",
                "With only one test collection it is not possible to generalize conclusions to other realistic settings.",
                "In this paper we focus on expertise retrieval in a realistic setting that differs from the W3C setting-one in which relatively small amounts of clean, multilingual data are available, that cover a broad range of expertise areas, as can be found on the intranets of universities and other knowledge-intensive organizations.",
                "Typically, this setting features several additional types of structure: topical structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization), <br>organizational structure</br> (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications, and academic homepages).",
                "This setting is quite different from the W3C setting in ways that might impact upon the performance of expertise retrieval tasks.",
                "We focus on a number of research questions in this paper: Does the relatively small amount of data available on an intranet affect the quality of the topic-person associations that lie at the heart of expertise retrieval algorithms?",
                "How do state-of-the-art algorithms developed on the W3C data set perform in the alternative scenario of the type described above?",
                "More generally, do the lessons from the Expert Finding task at TREC carry over to this setting?",

                "In addition to, how can the topical and <br>organizational structure</br> be used for retrieval purposes?",
                "To answer our research questions, we first present a set of baseline approaches, based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding associations between topics and people.",
                "This allows us to formulate the expert finding and expert profiling tasks in a uniform way, and has the added benefit of allowing us to understand the relations between the two tasks.",
                "For our experimental evaluation, we introduce a new data set (the UvT Expert Collection) which is representative of the type of intranet that we described above.",
                "Our collection is based on publicly available data, crawled from the website of Tilburg University (UvT).",
                "This type of data is particularly interesting, since (1) it is clean, heterogeneous, structured, and focused, but comprises a limited number of documents; (2) contains information on the organizational hierarchy; (3) it is bilingual (English and Dutch); and (4) the list of expertise areas of an individual are provided by the employees themselves.",
                "Using the UvT Expert collection, we conduct two sets of experiments.",
                "The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise finding and profiling methods in this new setting.",
                "A second group of experiments is aimed at extensions of the baseline methods that exploit characteristic features of the UvT Expert Collection; specifically, we propose and evaluate refined expert finding and profiling methods that incorporate topicality and <br>organizational structure</br>.",
                "Apart from the research questions and data set that we contribute, our main contributions are as follows.",
                "The baseline models developed for expertise finding perform well on the new data set.",
                "While on the W3C setting the expert finding task appears to be more difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case.",
                "We find that profiling on the UvT data set is considerably more difficult than on the W3C set, which we believe is due to the large (but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling: about 1,500 for the UvT set, versus 50 in the W3C case.",
                "Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly improve retrieval performance.",
                "The best performing similarity measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the W3C (and other) settings as well.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that the <br>organizational structure</br> can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In the next section we review related work.",
                "Then, in Section 3 we provide detailed descriptions of the expertise retrieval tasks that we address in this paper: expert finding and expert profiling.",
                "In Section 4 we present our baseline models, of which the performance is then assessed in Section 6 using the UvT data set that we introduce in Section 5.",
                "Advanced models exploiting specific features of our data are presented in Section 7 and evaluated in Section 8.",
                "We formulate our conclusions in Section 9. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and <br>organizational structure</br>-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
                "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",
                "By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .",
                "A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).",
                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.",
                "Examples of such context are: Who does she work with?",
                "What are her contact details?",
                "Is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself?",
                "What is her role in the organization?",
                "Who is her superior?",
                "Collaborators, and affiliations, etc. are all part of the candidates social profile, and can serve as a background against which the systems recommendations should be interpreted.",
                "In this paper we only address the problem of determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work.",
                "We state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: What is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidates (expertise) profile? where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca).",
                "Our task, then, is to estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required.",
                "Both the expert finding and profiling tasks rely on the accurate estimation of p(q|ca).",
                "The only difference derives from the prior probability that a person is an expert (p(ca)), which can be incorporated into the expert finding task.",
                "This prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 4.",
                "BASELINE MODELS In this section we describe our baseline models for estimating p(q|ca), i.e., associations between topics and people.",
                "Both expert finding and expert profiling boil down to this estimation.",
                "We employ three models for calculating this probability. 4.1 From topics to candidates Using Candidate Models: Model 1 Model 1 [4] defines the probability of a query given a candidate (p(q|ca)) using standard language modeling techniques, based on a multinomial unigram language model.",
                "For each candidate ca, a candidate language model θca is inferred such that the probability of a term given θca is nonzero for all terms, i.e., p(t|θca) > 0.",
                "From the candidate model the query is generated with the following probability: p(q|θca) = Y t∈q p(t|θca)n(t,q) , where each term t in the query q is sampled identically and independently, and n(t, q) is the number of times t occurs in q.",
                "The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.",
                "Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document.",
                "The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2.",
                "The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) .",
                "Model 1 amasses all the term information from all the documents associated with the candidate, and uses this to represent that candidate.",
                "This model is used to predict how likely a candidate would produce a query q.",
                "This can can be intuitively interpreted as the probability of this candidate talking about the query topic, where we assume that this is indicative of their expertise.",
                "Using Document Models: Model 2 Model 2 [4] takes a different approach.",
                "Here, the process is broken into two parts.",
                "Given a candidate ca, (1) a document that is associated with a candidate is selected with probability p(d|ca), and (2) from this document a query q is generated with probability p(q|d).",
                "Then the sum over all documents is taken to obtain p(q|ca), such that: p(q|ca) = X d p(q|d)p(d|ca). (5) The probability of a query given a document is estimated by inferring a document language model θd for each document d in a similar manner as the candidate model was inferred: p(t|θd) = (1 − λ)p(t|d) + λp(t), (6) where p(t|d) is the probability of the term in the document.",
                "The probability of a query given the document model is: p(q|θd) = Y t∈q p(t|θd)n(t,q) .",
                "The final estimate of p(q|ca) is obtained by substituting p(q|d) for p(q|θd) into Eq. 5 (see [4] for full details).",
                "Conceptually, Model 2 differs from Model 1 because the candidate is not directly modeled.",
                "Instead, the document acts like a hidden variable in the process which separates the query from the candidate.",
                "This process is akin to how a user may search for candidates with a standard search engine: initially by finding the documents which are relevant, and then seeing who is associated with that document.",
                "By examining a number of documents the user can obtain an idea of which candidates are more likely to discuss the topic q.",
                "Using Topic Models: Model 3 We introduce a third model, Model 3.",
                "Instead of attempting to model the query generation process via candidate or document models, we represent the query as a topic language model and directly estimate the probability of the candidate p(ca|q).",
                "This approach is similar to the model presented in [3, 19].",
                "As with the previous models, a language model is inferred, but this time for the query.",
                "We adapt the work of Lavrenko and Croft [14] to estimate a topic model from the query.",

                "Given a collection of documents and a query topic q, it is assumed that there exists an unknown topic model θk that assigns probabilities p(t|θk) to the term occurrences in the topic documents.",
                "Both the query and the documents are samples from θk (as opposed to the previous approaches, where a query is assumed to be sampled from a specific document or candidate model).",
                "The main task is to estimate p(t|θk), the probability of a term given the topic model.",
                "Since the query q is very sparse, and as there are no examples of documents on the topic, this distribution needs to be approximated.",
                "Lavrenko and Croft [14] suggest a reasonable way of obtaining such an approximation, by assuming that p(t|θk) can be approximated by the probability of term t given the query q.",
                "We can then estimate p(t|q) using the joint probability of observing the term t together with the query terms, q1, . . . , qm, and dividing by the joint probability of the query terms: p(t|θk) ≈ p(t|q) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) p(q1, . . . , qm) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm) , where p(q1, . . . , qm) = P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm), and T is the entire vocabulary of terms.",
                "In order to estimate the joint probability p(t, q1, . . . , qm), we follow [14, 15] and assume t and q1, . . . , qm are mutually independent, once we pick a source distribution from the set of underlying source distributions U.",
                "If we choose U to be a set of document models. then to construct this set, the query q would be issued against the collection, and the top n returned are assumed to be relevant to the topic, and thus treated as samples from the topic model. (Note that candidate models could be used instead.)",
                "With the document models forming U, the joint probability of term and query becomes: p(t, q1, . . . , qm) = X d∈U p(d) ˘ p(t|θd) mY i=1 p(qi|θd) ¯ . (7) Here, p(d) denotes the prior distribution over the set U, which reflects the relevance of the document to the topic.",
                "We assume that p(d) is uniform across U.",
                "In order to rank candidates according to the topic model defined, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence metric (KL, [8]) to measure the difference between the candidate models and the topic model: KL(θk||θca) = X t p(t|θk) log p(t|θk) p(t|θca) . (8) Candidates with a smaller divergence from the topic model are considered to be more likely experts on that topic.",
                "The candidate model θca is defined in Eq. 4.",

                "A second group of experiments is aimed at extensions of the baseline methods that exploit characteristic features of the UvT Expert Collection; specifically, we propose and evaluate refined expert finding and profiling methods that incorporate topicality and organizational structure.",
                "Apart from the research questions and data set that we contribute, our main contributions are as follows.",
                "The baseline models developed for expertise finding perform well on the new data set.",
                "While on the W3C setting the expert finding task appears to be more difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case.",
                "We find that profiling on the UvT data set is considerably more difficult than on the W3C set, which we believe is due to the large (but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling: about 1,500 for the UvT set, versus 50 in the W3C case.",
                "Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly improve retrieval performance.",
                "The best performing similarity measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the W3C (and other) settings as well.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that the organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%.",

                "In the next section we review related work.",
                "Then, in Section 3 we provide detailed descriptions of the expertise retrieval tasks that we address in this paper: expert finding and expert profiling.",
                "In Section 4 we present our baseline models, of which the performance is then assessed in Section 6 using the UvT data set that we introduce in Section 5.",
                "Advanced models exploiting specific features of our data are presented in Section 7 and evaluated in Section 8.",
                "We formulate our conclusions in Section 9. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
                "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",
                "By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .",
                "A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).",
                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.",
                "Examples of such context are: Who does she work with?",
                "What are her contact details?",
                "Is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself?",
                "What is her role in the organization?",
                "Who is her superior?",
                "Collaborators, and affiliations, etc. are all part of the candidates social profile, and can serve as a background against which the systems recommendations should be interpreted.",
                "In this paper we only address the problem of determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work.",
                "We state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: What is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidates (expertise) profile? where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca).",
                "Our task, then, is to estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required.",
                "Both the expert finding and profiling tasks rely on the accurate estimation of p(q|ca).",
                "The only difference derives from the prior probability that a person is an expert (p(ca)), which can be incorporated into the expert finding task.",
                "This prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 4.",
                "BASELINE MODELS In this section we describe our baseline models for estimating p(q|ca), i.e., associations between topics and people.",
                "Both expert finding and expert profiling boil down to this estimation.",
                "We employ three models for calculating this probability. 4.1 From topics to candidates Using Candidate Models: Model 1 Model 1 [4] defines the probability of a query given a candidate (p(q|ca)) using standard language modeling techniques, based on a multinomial unigram language model.",
                "For each candidate ca, a candidate language model θca is inferred such that the probability of a term given θca is nonzero for all terms, i.e., p(t|θca) > 0.",
                "From the candidate model the query is generated with the following probability: p(q|θca) = Y t∈q p(t|θca)n(t,q) , where each term t in the query q is sampled identically and independently, and n(t, q) is the number of times t occurs in q.",
                "The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.",
                "Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document.",
                "The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2.",
                "The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) .",
                "Model 1 amasses all the term information from all the documents associated with the candidate, and uses this to represent that candidate.",
                "This model is used to predict how likely a candidate would produce a query q.",
                "This can can be intuitively interpreted as the probability of this candidate talking about the query topic, where we assume that this is indicative of their expertise.",
                "Using Document Models: Model 2 Model 2 [4] takes a different approach.",
                "Here, the process is broken into two parts.",
                "Given a candidate ca, (1) a document that is associated with a candidate is selected with probability p(d|ca), and (2) from this document a query q is generated with probability p(q|d).",
                "Then the sum over all documents is taken to obtain p(q|ca), such that: p(q|ca) = X d p(q|d)p(d|ca). (5) The probability of a query given a document is estimated by inferring a document language model θd for each document d in a similar manner as the candidate model was inferred: p(t|θd) = (1 − λ)p(t|d) + λp(t), (6) where p(t|d) is the probability of the term in the document.",
                "The probability of a query given the document model is: p(q|θd) = Y t∈q p(t|θd)n(t,q) .",
                "The final estimate of p(q|ca) is obtained by substituting p(q|d) for p(q|θd) into Eq. 5 (see [4] for full details).",
                "Conceptually, Model 2 differs from Model 1 because the candidate is not directly modeled.",
                "Instead, the document acts like a hidden variable in the process which separates the query from the candidate.",
                "This process is akin to how a user may search for candidates with a standard search engine: initially by finding the documents which are relevant, and then seeing who is associated with that document.",
                "By examining a number of documents the user can obtain an idea of which candidates are more likely to discuss the topic q.",
                "Using Topic Models: Model 3 We introduce a third model, Model 3.",
                "Instead of attempting to model the query generation process via candidate or document models, we represent the query as a topic language model and directly estimate the probability of the candidate p(ca|q).",
                "This approach is similar to the model presented in [3, 19].",
                "As with the previous models, a language model is inferred, but this time for the query.",
                "We adapt the work of Lavrenko and Croft [14] to estimate a topic model from the query.",

                "Given a collection of documents and a query topic q, it is assumed that there exists an unknown topic model θk that assigns probabilities p(t|θk) to the term occurrences in the topic documents.",
                "Both the query and the documents are samples from θk (as opposed to the previous approaches, where a query is assumed to be sampled from a specific document or candidate model).",
                "The main task is to estimate p(t|θk), the probability of a term given the topic model.",
                "Since the query q is very sparse, and as there are no examples of documents on the topic, this distribution needs to be approximated.",
                "Lavrenko and Croft [14] suggest a reasonable way of obtaining such an approximation, by assuming that p(t|θk) can be approximated by the probability of term t given the query q.",
                "We can then estimate p(t|q) using the joint probability of observing the term t together with the query terms, q1, . . . , qm, and dividing by the joint probability of the query terms: p(t|θk) ≈ p(t|q) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) p(q1, . . . , qm) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm) , where p(q1, . . . , qm) = P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm), and T is the entire vocabulary of terms.",
                "In order to estimate the joint probability p(t, q1, . . . , qm), we follow [14, 15] and assume t and q1, . . . , qm are mutually independent, once we pick a source distribution from the set of underlying source distributions U.",
                "If we choose U to be a set of document models. then to construct this set, the query q would be issued against the collection, and the top n returned are assumed to be relevant to the topic, and thus treated as samples from the topic model. (Note that candidate models could be used instead.)",
                "With the document models forming U, the joint probability of term and query becomes: p(t, q1, . . . , qm) = X d∈U p(d) ˘ p(t|θd) mY i=1 p(qi|θd) ¯ . (7) Here, p(d) denotes the prior distribution over the set U, which reflects the relevance of the document to the topic.",
                "We assume that p(d) is uniform across U.",
                "In order to rank candidates according to the topic model defined, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence metric (KL, [8]) to measure the difference between the candidate models and the topic model: KL(θk||θca) = X t p(t|θk) log p(t|θk) p(t|θca) . (8) Candidates with a smaller divergence from the topic model are considered to be more likely experts on that topic.",
                "The candidate model θca is defined in Eq. 4.",
                "By using KL divergence instead of the probability of a candidate given the topic model p(ca|θk), we avoid normalization problems. 4.2 Document-candidate associations For our models we need to be able to estimate the probability p(d|ca), which expresses the extent to which a document d characterizes the candidate ca.",
                "In [4], two methods are presented for estimating this probability, based on the number of person names recognized in a document.",
                "However, in our (intranet) setting it is reasonable to assume that authors of documents can unambiguously be identified (e.g., as the author of an article, the teacher assigned to a course, the owner of a web page, etc.)",

                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we focused on expertise retrieval (expert finding and profiling) in a new setting of a typical knowledge-intensive organization in which the available data is of high quality, multilingual, and covering a broad range of expertise area.",
                "Typically, the amount of available data in such an organization (e.g., a university, a research institute, or a research lab) is limited when compared to the W3C collection that has mostly been used for the experimental evaluation of expertise retrieval so far.",
                "To examine expertise retrieval in this setting, we introduced (and released) the UvT Expert collection as a representative case of such knowledge intensive organizations.",
                "The new collection reflects the typical properties of knowledge-intensive institutes noted above and also includes several features which may are potentially useful for expertise retrieval, such as topical and organizational structure.",
                "We evaluated how current state-of-the-art models for expert finding and profiling performed in this new setting and then refined these models in order to try and exploit the different characteristics within the data environment (language, topicality, and organizational structure).",
                "We found that current models of expertise retrieval generalize well to this new environment; in addition we found that refining the models to account for the differences results in significant improvements, thus making up for problems caused by data sparseness issues.",

                "The goal of expert finding is to identify a list of people who are knowledgeable about a given topic.",
                "This task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between people and topics [10]; commonly, a co-occurrence of the name of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be evidence of expertise.",

                "Typically, this setting features several additional types of structure: topical structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization), organizational structure (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications, and academic homepages).",

                "This allows us to formulate the expert finding and expert profiling tasks in a uniform way, and has the added benefit of allowing us to understand the relations between the two tasks.",

                "Using the UvT Expert collection, we conduct two sets of experiments.",

                "Apart from the research questions and data set that we contribute, our main contributions are as follows.",
                "The baseline models developed for expertise finding perform well on the new data set.",
                "While on the W3C setting the expert finding task appears to be more difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case.",
                "We find that profiling on the UvT data set is considerably more difficult than on the W3C set, which we believe is due to the large (but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling: about 1,500 for the UvT set, versus 50 in the W3C case.",
                "Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly improve retrieval performance.",
                "The best performing similarity measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the W3C (and other) settings as well.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that the organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%.",

                "In the next section we review related work.",

                "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",

                "While on the W3C setting the expert finding task appears to be more difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case.",
                "We find that profiling on the UvT data set is considerably more difficult than on the W3C set, which we believe is due to the large (but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling: about 1,500 for the UvT set, versus 50 in the W3C case.",
                "Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly improve retrieval performance.",
                "The best performing similarity measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the W3C (and other) settings as well.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that the organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%.",

                "In the next section we review related work.",

                "We formulate our conclusions in Section 9. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",

                "The goal of expert finding is to identify a list of people who are knowledgeable about a given topic.",
                "This task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between people and topics [10]; commonly, a co-occurrence of the name of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be evidence of expertise.",

                "In the next section we review related work.",

                "We formulate our conclusions in Section 9. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
                "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",
                "By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .",
                "A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).",
                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.",
                "Examples of such context are: Who does she work with?",
                "What are her contact details?",
                "Is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself?",
                "What is her role in the organization?",
                "Who is her superior?",
                "Collaborators, and affiliations, etc. are all part of the candidates social profile, and can serve as a background against which the systems recommendations should be interpreted.",
                "In this paper we only address the problem of determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work.",
                "We state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: What is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidates (expertise) profile? where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca).",
                "Our task, then, is to estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required.",
                "Both the expert finding and profiling tasks rely on the accurate estimation of p(q|ca).",
                "The only difference derives from the prior probability that a person is an expert (p(ca)), which can be incorporated into the expert finding task.",
                "This prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 4.",
                "BASELINE MODELS In this section we describe our baseline models for estimating p(q|ca), i.e., associations between topics and people.",
                "Both expert finding and expert profiling boil down to this estimation.",
                "We employ three models for calculating this probability. 4.1 From topics to candidates Using Candidate Models: Model 1 Model 1 [4] defines the probability of a query given a candidate (p(q|ca)) using standard language modeling techniques, based on a multinomial unigram language model.",
                "For each candidate ca, a candidate language model θca is inferred such that the probability of a term given θca is nonzero for all terms, i.e., p(t|θca) > 0.",

                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the <br>expert finding task</br> at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
                "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",
                "By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .",
                "A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).",
                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.",
                "Examples of such context are: Who does she work with?",

                "The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.",
                "Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document.",
                "The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2.",
                "The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) .",

                "The main task is to estimate p(t|θk), the probability of a term given the topic model.",
                "Since the query q is very sparse, and as there are no examples of documents on the topic, this distribution needs to be approximated.",

                "We can then estimate p(t|q) using the joint probability of observing the term t together with the query terms, q1, . . . , qm, and dividing by the joint probability of the query terms: p(t|θk) ≈ p(t|q) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) p(q1, . . . , qm) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm) , where p(q1, . . . , qm) = P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm), and T is the entire vocabulary of terms.",

                "At the TREC Enterprise Track [22] the need to study and understand expertise retrieval has been recognized through the introduction of Expert Finding tasks.",
                "The goal of expert finding is to identify a list of people who are knowledgeable about a given topic.",
                "This task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between people and topics [10]; commonly, a <br>co-occurrence</br> of the name of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be evidence of expertise.",
                "An alternative task, which using the same idea of people-topic associations, is expert profiling, where the task is to return a list of topics that a person is knowledgeable about [3].",
                "The launch of the Expert Finding task at TREC has generated a lot of interest in expertise retrieval, with rapid progress being made in terms of modeling, algorithms, and evaluation aspects.",
                "However, nearly all of the expert finding or profiling work performed has been validated experimentally using the W3C collection [24] from the Enterprise Track.",
                "While this collection is currently the only publicly available test collection for expertise retrieval tasks, it only represents one type of intranet.",
                "With only one test collection it is not possible to generalize conclusions to other realistic settings.",
                "In this paper we focus on expertise retrieval in a realistic setting that differs from the W3C setting-one in which relatively small amounts of clean, multilingual data are available, that cover a broad range of expertise areas, as can be found on the intranets of universities and other knowledge-intensive organizations.",
                "Typically, this setting features several additional types of structure: topical structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization), organizational structure (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications, and academic homepages).",
                "This setting is quite different from the W3C setting in ways that might impact upon the performance of expertise retrieval tasks.",
                "We focus on a number of research questions in this paper: Does the relatively small amount of data available on an intranet affect the quality of the topic-person associations that lie at the heart of expertise retrieval algorithms?",
                "How do state-of-the-art algorithms developed on the W3C data set perform in the alternative scenario of the type described above?",
                "More generally, do the lessons from the Expert Finding task at TREC carry over to this setting?",
                "How does the inclusion or exclusion of different documents affect expertise retrieval tasks?",
                "In addition to, how can the topical and organizational structure be used for retrieval purposes?",
                "To answer our research questions, we first present a set of baseline approaches, based on generative language modeling, aimed at finding associations between topics and people.",
                "This allows us to formulate the expert finding and expert profiling tasks in a uniform way, and has the added benefit of allowing us to understand the relations between the two tasks.",
                "For our experimental evaluation, we introduce a new data set (the UvT Expert Collection) which is representative of the type of intranet that we described above.",
                "Our collection is based on publicly available data, crawled from the website of Tilburg University (UvT).",
                "This type of data is particularly interesting, since (1) it is clean, heterogeneous, structured, and focused, but comprises a limited number of documents; (2) contains information on the organizational hierarchy; (3) it is bilingual (English and Dutch); and (4) the list of expertise areas of an individual are provided by the employees themselves.",
                "Using the UvT Expert collection, we conduct two sets of experiments.",
                "The first is aimed at determining the effectiveness of baseline expertise finding and profiling methods in this new setting.",
                "A second group of experiments is aimed at extensions of the baseline methods that exploit characteristic features of the UvT Expert Collection; specifically, we propose and evaluate refined expert finding and profiling methods that incorporate topicality and organizational structure.",
                "Apart from the research questions and data set that we contribute, our main contributions are as follows.",
                "The baseline models developed for expertise finding perform well on the new data set.",
                "While on the W3C setting the expert finding task appears to be more difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case.",
                "We find that profiling on the UvT data set is considerably more difficult than on the W3C set, which we believe is due to the large (but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling: about 1,500 for the UvT set, versus 50 in the W3C case.",
                "Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly improve retrieval performance.",
                "The best performing similarity measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the W3C (and other) settings as well.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that the organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%.",
                "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
                "In the next section we review related work.",
                "Then, in Section 3 we provide detailed descriptions of the expertise retrieval tasks that we address in this paper: expert finding and expert profiling.",
                "In Section 4 we present our baseline models, of which the performance is then assessed in Section 6 using the UvT data set that we introduce in Section 5.",
                "Advanced models exploiting specific features of our data are presented in Section 7 and evaluated in Section 8.",
                "We formulate our conclusions in Section 9. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the <br>co-occurrence</br> of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
                "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",
                "By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .",
                "A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).",
                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.",
                "Examples of such context are: Who does she work with?",
                "What are her contact details?",
                "Is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself?",
                "What is her role in the organization?",
                "Who is her superior?",
                "Collaborators, and affiliations, etc. are all part of the candidates social profile, and can serve as a background against which the systems recommendations should be interpreted.",
                "In this paper we only address the problem of determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work.",
                "We state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: What is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidates (expertise) profile? where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca).",
                "Our task, then, is to estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required.",
                "Both the expert finding and profiling tasks rely on the accurate estimation of p(q|ca).",
                "The only difference derives from the prior probability that a person is an expert (p(ca)), which can be incorporated into the expert finding task.",
                "This prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 4.",
                "BASELINE MODELS In this section we describe our baseline models for estimating p(q|ca), i.e., associations between topics and people.",
                "Both expert finding and expert profiling boil down to this estimation.",
                "We employ three models for calculating this probability. 4.1 From topics to candidates Using Candidate Models: Model 1 Model 1 [4] defines the probability of a query given a candidate (p(q|ca)) using standard language modeling techniques, based on a multinomial unigram language model.",
                "For each candidate ca, a candidate language model θca is inferred such that the probability of a term given θca is nonzero for all terms, i.e., p(t|θca) > 0.",
                "From the candidate model the query is generated with the following probability: p(q|θca) = Y t∈q p(t|θca)n(t,q) , where each term t in the query q is sampled identically and independently, and n(t, q) is the number of times t occurs in q.",
                "The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.",
                "Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document.",
                "The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2.",
                "The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) .",
                "Model 1 amasses all the term information from all the documents associated with the candidate, and uses this to represent that candidate.",
                "This model is used to predict how likely a candidate would produce a query q.",
                "This can can be intuitively interpreted as the probability of this candidate talking about the query topic, where we assume that this is indicative of their expertise.",
                "Using Document Models: Model 2 Model 2 [4] takes a different approach.",
                "Here, the process is broken into two parts.",
                "Given a candidate ca, (1) a document that is associated with a candidate is selected with probability p(d|ca), and (2) from this document a query q is generated with probability p(q|d).",
                "Then the sum over all documents is taken to obtain p(q|ca), such that: p(q|ca) = X d p(q|d)p(d|ca). (5) The probability of a query given a document is estimated by inferring a document language model θd for each document d in a similar manner as the candidate model was inferred: p(t|θd) = (1 − λ)p(t|d) + λp(t), (6) where p(t|d) is the probability of the term in the document.",
                "The probability of a query given the document model is: p(q|θd) = Y t∈q p(t|θd)n(t,q) .",
                "The final estimate of p(q|ca) is obtained by substituting p(q|d) for p(q|θd) into Eq. 5 (see [4] for full details).",
                "Conceptually, Model 2 differs from Model 1 because the candidate is not directly modeled.",
                "Instead, the document acts like a hidden variable in the process which separates the query from the candidate.",
                "This process is akin to how a user may search for candidates with a standard search engine: initially by finding the documents which are relevant, and then seeing who is associated with that document.",
                "By examining a number of documents the user can obtain an idea of which candidates are more likely to discuss the topic q.",
                "Using Topic Models: Model 3 We introduce a third model, Model 3.",
                "Instead of attempting to model the query generation process via candidate or document models, we represent the query as a topic language model and directly estimate the probability of the candidate p(ca|q).",
                "This approach is similar to the model presented in [3, 19].",
                "As with the previous models, a language model is inferred, but this time for the query.",
                "We adapt the work of Lavrenko and Croft [14] to estimate a topic model from the query.",
                "The procedure is as follows.",
                "Given a collection of documents and a query topic q, it is assumed that there exists an unknown topic model θk that assigns probabilities p(t|θk) to the term occurrences in the topic documents.",
                "Both the query and the documents are samples from θk (as opposed to the previous approaches, where a query is assumed to be sampled from a specific document or candidate model).",
                "The main task is to estimate p(t|θk), the probability of a term given the topic model.",
                "Since the query q is very sparse, and as there are no examples of documents on the topic, this distribution needs to be approximated.",
                "Lavrenko and Croft [14] suggest a reasonable way of obtaining such an approximation, by assuming that p(t|θk) can be approximated by the probability of term t given the query q.",
                "We can then estimate p(t|q) using the joint probability of observing the term t together with the query terms, q1, . . . , qm, and dividing by the joint probability of the query terms: p(t|θk) ≈ p(t|q) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) p(q1, . . . , qm) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm) , where p(q1, . . . , qm) = P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm), and T is the entire vocabulary of terms.",
                "In order to estimate the joint probability p(t, q1, . . . , qm), we follow [14, 15] and assume t and q1, . . . , qm are mutually independent, once we pick a source distribution from the set of underlying source distributions U.",
                "If we choose U to be a set of document models. then to construct this set, the query q would be issued against the collection, and the top n returned are assumed to be relevant to the topic, and thus treated as samples from the topic model. (Note that candidate models could be used instead.)",
                "With the document models forming U, the joint probability of term and query becomes: p(t, q1, . . . , qm) = X d∈U p(d) ˘ p(t|θd) mY i=1 p(qi|θd) ¯ . (7) Here, p(d) denotes the prior distribution over the set U, which reflects the relevance of the document to the topic.",
                "We assume that p(d) is uniform across U.",
                "In order to rank candidates according to the topic model defined, we use the Kullback-Leibler divergence metric (KL, [8]) to measure the difference between the candidate models and the topic model: KL(θk||θca) = X t p(t|θk) log p(t|θk) p(t|θca) . (8) Candidates with a smaller divergence from the topic model are considered to be more likely experts on that topic.",
                "The candidate model θca is defined in Eq. 4.",
                "By using KL divergence instead of the probability of a candidate given the topic model p(ca|θk), we avoid normalization problems. 4.2 Document-candidate associations For our models we need to be able to estimate the probability p(d|ca), which expresses the extent to which a document d characterizes the candidate ca.",
                "In [4], two methods are presented for estimating this probability, based on the number of person names recognized in a document.",
                "However, in our (intranet) setting it is reasonable to assume that authors of documents can unambiguously be identified (e.g., as the author of an article, the teacher assigned to a course, the owner of a web page, etc.)",
                "Hence, we set p(d|ca) to be 1 if candidate ca is author of document d, otherwise the probability is 0.",
                "In Section 6 we describe how authorship can be determined on different types of documents within the collection. 5.",

                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",

[21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",

                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",

                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",

                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) .

                "In this paper we only address the problem of determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work.",
                "We state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: What is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidates (expertise) profile? where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca).",
                "Our task, then, is to estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required.",

                "From the candidate model the query is generated with the following probability: p(q|θca) = Y t∈q p(t|θca)n(t,q) , where each term t in the query q is sampled identically and independently, and n(t, q) is the number of times t occurs in q.",
                "The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.",
                "Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document.",
                "The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2.",
                "The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) .",

                "Instead, the document acts like a hidden variable in the process which separates the query from the candidate.",
                "This process is akin to how a user may search for candidates with a standard search engine: initially by finding the documents which are relevant, and then seeing who is associated with that document.",

                "The main task is to estimate p(t|θk), the probability of a term given the topic model.",
                "Since the query q is very sparse, and as there are no examples of documents on the topic, this distribution needs to be approximated.",
                "Lavrenko and Croft [14] suggest a reasonable way of obtaining such an approximation, by assuming that p(t|θk) can be approximated by the probability of term t given the query q.",

                "Typically, this setting features several additional types of structure: topical structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization), organizational structure (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications, and academic homepages).",

                "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking <br>bayes theorem</br>, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
                "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",
                "By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .",
                "A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).",
                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.",
                "Examples of such context are: Who does she work with?",
                "What are her contact details?",
                "Is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself?",
                "What is her role in the organization?",
                "Who is her superior?",
                "Collaborators, and affiliations, etc. are all part of the candidates social profile, and can serve as a background against which the systems recommendations should be interpreted.",
                "In this paper we only address the problem of determining topical profiles, and leave social profiling to further work.",
                "We state the problem of quantifying the competence of a person on a certain knowledge area as follows: What is the probability of a knowledge area (ki) being part of the candidates (expertise) profile? where s(ca, ki) is defined by p(ki|ca).",
                "Our task, then, is to estimate p(ki|ca), which is equivalent to the problem of obtaining p(q|ca), where the topic ki is represented as a query topic q, i.e., a sequence of keywords representing the expertise required.",
                "Both the expert finding and profiling tasks rely on the accurate estimation of p(q|ca).",
                "The only difference derives from the prior probability that a person is an expert (p(ca)), which can be incorporated into the expert finding task.",
                "This prior does not apply to the profiling task since the candidate (individual) is fixed. 4.",
                "BASELINE MODELS In this section we describe our baseline models for estimating p(q|ca), i.e., associations between topics and people.",
                "Both expert finding and expert profiling boil down to this estimation.",
                "We employ three models for calculating this probability. 4.1 From topics to candidates Using Candidate Models: Model 1 Model 1 [4] defines the probability of a query given a candidate (p(q|ca)) using standard language modeling techniques, based on a multinomial unigram language model.",
                "For each candidate ca, a candidate language model θca is inferred such that the probability of a term given θca is nonzero for all terms, i.e., p(t|θca) > 0.",

                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of expert finding and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three <br>baseline model</br>s, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",

                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",

                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
                "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",

                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) .

                "From the candidate model the query is generated with the following probability: p(q|θca) = Y t∈q p(t|θca)n(t,q) , where each term t in the query q is sampled identically and independently, and n(t, q) is the number of times t occurs in q.",
                "The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.",
                "Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document.",
                "The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2.",
                "The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) .",

                "Then the sum over all documents is taken to obtain p(q|ca), such that: p(q|ca) = X d p(q|d)p(d|ca). (5) The probability of a query given a document is estimated by inferring a document language model θd for each document d in a similar manner as the candidate model was inferred: p(t|θd) = (1 − λ)p(t|d) + λp(t), (6) where p(t|d) is the probability of the term in the document.",

                "The final estimate of p(q|ca) is obtained by substituting p(q|d) for p(q|θd) into Eq. 5 (see [4] for full details).",
                "Conceptually, Model 2 differs from Model 1 because the candidate is not directly modeled.",
                "Instead, the document acts like a hidden variable in the process which separates the query from the candidate.",
                "This process is akin to how a user may search for candidates with a standard search engine: initially by finding the documents which are relevant, and then seeing who is associated with that document.",

                "Both the query and the documents are samples from θk (as opposed to the previous approaches, where a query is assumed to be sampled from a specific document or candidate model).",
                "The main task is to estimate p(t|θk), the probability of a term given the topic model.",
                "Since the query q is very sparse, and as there are no examples of documents on the topic, this distribution needs to be approximated.",
                "Lavrenko and Croft [14] suggest a reasonable way of obtaining such an approximation, by assuming that p(t|θk) can be approximated by the probability of term t given the query q.",
                "We can then estimate p(t|q) using the joint probability of observing the term t together with the query terms, q1, . . . , qm, and dividing by the joint probability of the query terms: p(t|θk) ≈ p(t|q) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) p(q1, . . . , qm) = p(t, q1, . . . , qm) P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm) , where p(q1, . . . , qm) = P t ∈T p(t , q1, . . . , qm), and T is the entire vocabulary of terms.",

                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, expert finding and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",

                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of expert finding around.",

                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) .

                "The candidate language model is inferred as follows: (1) an empirical model p(t|ca) is computed; (2) it is smoothed with background probabilities.",
                "Using the associations between a candidate and a document, the probability p(t|ca) can be approximated by: p(t|ca) = X d p(t|d)p(d|ca), where p(d|ca) is the probability that candidate ca generates a supporting document d, and p(t|d) is the probability of a term t occurring in the document d. We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d. The strength of the association between document d and candidate ca expressed by p(d|ca) reflects the degree to which the candidates expertise is described using this document.",
                "The estimation of this probability is presented later, in Section 4.2.",
                "The candidate model is then constructed as a linear interpolation of p(t|ca) and the background model p(t) to ensure there are no zero probabilities, which results in the final estimation: p(q|θca) = (4) Y t∈q ( (1 − λ) X d p(t|d)p(d|ca) ! + λp(t) )n(t,q) .",

                "This task is usually addressed by uncovering associations between people and topics [10]; commonly, a co-occurrence of the name of a person with topics in the same context is assumed to be evidence of expertise.",

                "Typically, this setting features several additional types of structure: topical structure (e.g., topic hierarchies as employed by the organization), organizational structure (faculty, department, ...), as well as multiple types of documents (research and course descriptions, publications, and academic homepages).",
                "This setting is quite different from the W3C setting in ways that might impact upon the performance of expertise retrieval tasks.",

                "Using the UvT Expert collection, we conduct two sets of experiments.",

                "While on the W3C setting the <br>expert find</br>ing task appears to be more difficult than profiling, for the UvT data the opposite is the case.",
                "We find that profiling on the UvT data set is considerably more difficult than on the W3C set, which we believe is due to the large (but realistic) number of topical areas that we used for profiling: about 1,500 for the UvT set, versus 50 in the W3C case.",
                "Taking the similarity between topics into account can significantly improve retrieval performance.",
                "The best performing similarity measures are content-based, therefore they can be applied on the W3C (and other) settings as well.",
                "Finally, we demonstrate that the organizational structure can be exploited in the form of a context model, improving MAP scores for certain models by up to 70%.",

                "In the next section we review related work.",

                "We formulate our conclusions in Section 9. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Initial approaches to expertise finding often employed databases containing information on the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization [11].",
                "Most of these tools (usually called yellow pages or people-finding systems) rely on people to self-assess their skills against a predefined set of keywords.",
                "For updating profiles in these systems in an automatic fashion there is a need for intelligent technologies [5].",
                "More recent approaches use specific document sets (such as email [6] or software [18]) to find expertise.",
                "In contrast with focusing on particular document types, there is also an increased interest in the development of systems that index and mine published intranet documents as sources of evidence for expertise.",
                "One such published approach is the P@noptic system [9], which builds a representation of each person by concatenating all documents associated with that person-this is similar to Model 1 of Balog et al. [4], who formalize and compare two methods.",
                "Balog et al.s Model 1 directly models the knowledge of an expert from associated documents, while their Model 2 first locates documents on the topic and then finds the associated experts.",
                "In the reported experiments the second method performs significantly better when there are sufficiently many associated documents per candidate.",
                "Most systems that took part in the 2005 and 2006 editions of the Expert Finding task at TREC implemented (variations on) one of these two models; see [10, 20].",
                "Macdonald and Ounis [16] propose a different approach for ranking candidate expertise with respect to a topic based on data fusion techniques, without using collectionspecific heuristics; they find that applying field-based weighting models improves the ranking of candidates.",
                "Petkova and Croft [19] propose yet another approach, based on a combination of the above Model 1 and 2, explicitly modeling topics.",
                "Turning to other expert retrieval tasks that can also be addressed using topic-people associations, Balog and de Rijke [3] addressed the task of determining topical expert profiles.",
                "While their methods proved to be efficient on the W3C corpus, they require an amount of data that may not be available in the typical knowledge-intensive organization.",
                "Balog and de Rijke [2] study the related task of finding experts that are similar to a small set of experts given as input.",
                "As an aside, creating a textual summary of a person shows some similarities to biography finding, which has received a considerable amount of attention recently; see e.g., [13].",
                "We use generative language modeling to find associations between topics and people.",
                "In our modeling of <br>expert find</br>ing and profiling we collect evidence for expertise from multiple sources, in a heterogeneous collection, and integrate it with the co-occurrence of candidates names and query terms-the language modeling setting allows us to do this in a transparent manner.",
                "Our modeling proceeds in two steps.",
                "In the first step, we consider three baseline models, two taken from [4] (the Models 1 and 2 mentioned above), and one a refined version of a model introduced in [3] (which we refer to as Model 3 below); this third model is also similar to the model described by Petkova and Croft [19].",
                "The models we consider in our second round of experiments are mixture models similar to contextual language models [1] and to the expanded documents of Tao et al. [21]; however, the features that we use for definining our expansions-including topical structure and organizational structure-have not been used in this way before. 3.",
                "TASKS In the expertise retrieval scenario that we envisage, users seeking expertise within an organization have access to an interface that combines a search box (where they can search for experts or topics) with navigational structures (of experts and of topics) that allows them to click their way to an expert page (providing the profile of a person) or a topic page (providing a list of experts on the topic).",
                "To feed the above interface, we face two expertise retrieval tasks, <br>expert find</br>ing and expert profiling, that we first define and then formalize using generative language models.",
                "In order to model either task, the probability of the query topic being associated to a candidate expert plays a key role in the final estimates for searching and profiling.",
                "By using language models, both the candidates and the query are characterized by distributions of terms in the vocabulary (used in the documents made available by the organization whose expertise retrieval needs we are addressing). 3.1 Expert finding Expert finding involves the task of finding the right person with the appropriate skills and knowledge: Who are the experts on topic X?.",
                "E.g., an employee wants to ascertain who worked on a particular project to find out why particular decisions were made without having to trawl through documentation (if there is any).",
                "Or, they may be in need a trained specialist for consultancy on a specific problem.",
                "Within an organization there are usually many possible candidates who could be experts for given topic.",
                "We can state this problem as follows: What is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q?",
                "That is, we determine p(ca|q), and rank candidates ca according to this probability.",
                "The candidates with the highest probability given the query are deemed the most likely experts for that topic.",
                "The challenge is how to estimate this probability accurately.",
                "Since the query is likely to consist of only a few terms to describe the expertise required, we should be able to obtain a more accurate estimate by invoking Bayes Theorem, and estimating: p(ca|q) = p(q|ca)p(ca) p(q) , (1) where p(ca) is the probability of a candidate and p(q) is the probability of a query.",
                "Since p(q) is a constant, it can be ignored for ranking purposes.",
                "Thus, the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query q is proportional to the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), weighted by the a priori belief p(ca) that candidate ca is an expert. p(ca|q) ∝ p(q|ca)p(ca) (2) In this paper our main focus is on estimating the probability of a query given the candidate p(q|ca), because this probability captures the extent to which the candidate knows about the query topic.",
                "Whereas the candidate priors are generally assumed to be uniformand thus will not influence the ranking-it has been demonstrated that a sensible choice of priors may improve the performance [20]. 3.2 Expert profiling While the task of expert searching was concerned with finding experts given a particular topic, the task of expert profiling seeks to answer a related question: What topics does a candidate know about?",
                "Essentially, this turns the questions of <br>expert find</br>ing around.",
                "The profiling of an individual candidate involves the identification of areas of skills and knowledge that they have expertise about and an evaluation of the level of proficiency in each of these areas.",
                "This is the candidates topical profile.",
                "Generally, topical profiles within organizations consist of tabular structures which explicitly catalogue the skills and knowledge of each individual in the organization.",
                "However, such practice is limited by the resources available for defining, creating, maintaining, and updating these profiles over time.",
                "By focusing on automatic methods which draw upon the available evidence within the document repositories of an organization, our aim is to reduce the human effort associated with the maintenance of topical profiles1 .",
                "A topical profile of a candidate, then, is defined as a vector where each element i of the vector corresponds to the candidate cas expertise on a given topic ki, (i.e., s(ca, ki)).",
                "Each topic ki defines a particular knowledge area or skill that the organization uses to define the candidates topical profile.",
                "Thus, it is assumed that a list of topics, {k1, . . . , kn}, where n is the number of pre-defined topics, is given: profile(ca) = s(ca, k1), s(ca, k2), . . . , s(ca, kn) . (3) 1 Context and evidence are needed to help users of expertise finding systems to decide whom to contact when seeking expertise in a particular area.",
                "Examples of such context are: Who does she work with?",
                "What are her contact details?",
                "Is she well-connected, just in case she is not able to help us herself?",
                "What is her role in the organization?",
                "Who is her superior?",
                "Collaborators, and affiliations, etc. are all part of the candidates social profile, and can serve as a background against which the systems recommendations should be interpreted.",

We use the maximum-likelihood estimate of a term, that is, the normalised frequency of the term t in document d.
