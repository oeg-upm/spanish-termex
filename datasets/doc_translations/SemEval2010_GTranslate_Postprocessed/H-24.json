White Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 ryenw@microsoft.com Dan Morris Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 dan@microsoft.com ABSTRACT One way to help all users of commercial Web search engines be more successful in their searches is to better understand what those users with greater search expertise are doing, and use this knowledge to benefit everyone. In this paper we study the interaction logs of advanced search engine users (and those not so advanced) to better understand how these user groups search. The results show that there are marked differences in the queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators), relative to those classified as non-advanced. Our findings have implications for how advanced users should be supported during their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help searchers of all experience levels find more relevant information and learn improved searching strategies.

INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3]. Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file. These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results. IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax. Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]). However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies. Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces. There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms. De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries. They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search. However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15]. Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted. In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly. We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13]. Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit. Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target. We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success? Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions. A relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or use advanced users interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches. We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this analysis in Section 5. In Section 6 we discuss the implications of this research, and we conclude in Section 7. 2. RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]). There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively. Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs. A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users. These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4]. However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved. It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality. Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs. In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents. It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17]. Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden. This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1]. In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries. Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail. Query modifiers such as + (plus), âˆ’ (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms. Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space. Queries created with these techniques can be powerful. However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features. Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25]. This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems. Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone. Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics. In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors. Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired. However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]). Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user. Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16]. In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines. To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period. In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3. DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed. To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006. When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited. This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior. In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs. These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected. We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages. We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study. To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries. In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers. We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation. We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise. To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration. This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail. If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user. The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way. All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited. To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax. We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups. In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4. SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success. The query and result-click characteristics we chose to examine are described in more detail in Table 1. Table 1. Query and result-click features (per user). Feature Meaning Queries Per Second (QPS) Avg. number of queries per second between initial query and end-of-session Query Repeat Rate (QRR) Fraction of queries that are repeats Query Word Length (QWL) Avg. number of words in query Queries Per Day (QPD) Avg. number of queries per day Avg. Click Position (ACP) Avg. rank of clicked results Click Probability (CP) Ratio of result clicks to queries Avg. Seconds To Click (ASC) Avg. search to result click interval These seven features give us a useful overview of users direct interactions with search engines, but not of how users are looking for relevant information beyond the result page or how successful they are in locating relevant information. Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior. To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section. A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes. More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33]. In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users. The median number of search trails per user was 30. The median number of steps in the trails was 3. All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page. The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails. All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path. A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation. The post-query browsing features are described further in Table 2. Table 2. Post-query browsing features (per trail). Feature Meaning Session Seconds (SS) Average session length (in seconds) Trail Seconds (TS) Average trail length (in seconds) Display Seconds (DS) Average display time for each page on the trail (in seconds) Num. Steps (NS) Average number of steps from the page following the results page to the end of the trail Num. Branches (NB) Average number of branches Num. Backs (NBA) Average number of back operations As well as using these attributes of users interactions, we also used the relevance judgments described earlier in the paper to measure the degree of search success based on the relevance judgments assigned to pages that lie on the search trail. Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries. Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%). We use these judgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a number of ways. In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects. We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents. Table 3. Relevance judgment measures (per trail). Measure Meaning First Judgment assigned to the first page in the trail Last Judgment assigned to the last page in the trail Average Average judgment across all pages in the trail Maximum Maximum judgment across all pages in the trail These measures are used during our analysis to estimate the relevance of the pages viewed at different stages in the trails, and allow us to estimate search success in different ways. We chose multiple measures, as users may encounter relevant information in many ways and at different points in the trail (e.g., single highlyrelevant document or gradually over the course of the trail). The features described in this section allowed us to analyze important attributes of the search process that must be better understood if we are to support users in their searching. In the next section we present the findings of the analysis. 5. FINDINGS Our analysis is divided into three parts: analysis of query behavior and interaction with the results page, analysis of post-query navigation behavior, and search success in terms of locating judged-relevant documents. Parametric statistical testing is used, and the level of significance for the statistical tests is set to .05. 5.1 Query and result-click behavior We were interested in comparing the query and result-click behaviors of our advanced and non-advanced users. In Table 4 we show the mean average values for each of the seven search features for our users. We use padvanced to denote the percentage of all queries from each user that contains advanced syntax (i.e., padvanced = 0% means a user never used advanced syntax). The table shows values for users that do not use query operators (0%), users who submitted at least one query with operators (â‰¥ 0%), through to users whose queries contained operators at least threequarters of the time (â‰¥ 75%). Table 4. Query and result click features (per user). Feature padvanced 0% > 0% â‰¥ 25% â‰¥ 50% â‰¥ 75% QPS .028 .010 .012 .013 .015 QRR .53 .57 .58 .61 .62 QWL 2.02 2.83 3.40 3.66 4.04 QPD 2.01 3.52 2.70 2.66 2.31 ACP 6.83 9.12 10.09 10.17 11.37 CP .57 .51 .47 .47 .47 ASC 87.71 88.16 112.44 102.12 79.13 %Users 79.90% 20.10% .79% .18% .04% We compared the query and result click features of users who did not use any advanced syntax (padvanced = 0%) in any of their queries with those who used advanced syntax in at least one query (padvanced > 0%). The columns corresponding to these two groups are bolded in Table 4. We performed an independent measures ttest between these groups for each of the features. Since this analysis involved many features, we use a Bonferroni correction to control the experiment-wise error rate and set the alpha level (Î±) to .007, i.e., .05 divided by the number of features. This correction reduces the number of Type I errors i.e., rejecting null hypotheses that are true. All differences between the groups were statistically significant (all t(188403) â‰¥ 2.81, all p â‰¤ .002). However, given the large sample sizes, all differences in the means were likely to be statistically significant. We applied a Cohens d-test to determine the effect size for each of the comparisons between the advanced and non-advanced user groups. Ordering in descending order by effect size, the main findings are that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search engine users: â€¢ Query less frequently in a session (d = 1.98) â€¢ Compose longer queries (d = .69) â€¢ Click further down the result list (d = .67) â€¢ Submit more queries per day (d = .49) â€¢ Are less likely to click on a result (d = .32) â€¢ Repeat queries more often (d = .16) The increased likelihood that advanced search engine users will click further down the result list implies that they may be less trusting of the search engines ability to rank the most relevant document first, that they are more willing to explore beyond the most popular pages for a given query, that they may be submitting different types of queries (e.g., informational rather than navigational), or that they may have customized their search settings to display more than only the default top-10 results. Many of the findings listed are consistent with those identified in other studies of advanced searchers querying and result-click behaviors [13][34]. Given that the only criteria we employed to classify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced syntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to identify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported previously for those with more search expertise. As mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which the average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who submit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data collection and submit at least one query containing advanced query operators. In other words, we consider users whose percentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is greater than zero. The use of query operators in any queries, regardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the existence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of familiarity with the search system. We further hypothesized that users whose queries more frequently contained advanced syntax may be more advanced search engine users. To test this we investigated varying the query threshold required to qualify for advanced status (padvanced). We incremented padvanced one percentage point at a time, and recorded the values of the seven query and result-click features at each point. The values of the features at four milestones (> 0%, â‰¥ 25%, â‰¥ 50%, and â‰¥ 75%) are shown in Table 4. As can be seen in the table, as padvanced increases, differences in the features between those using advanced syntax and those not using advanced syntax become more substantial. However, it is interesting to note that as padvanced increases, the number of queries submitted per day actually falls (Pearsons R = âˆ’.512, t(98) = 5.98, p < .0001). More advanced users may need to pose fewer queries to find relevant information. To study the patterns of relationship among these dependent variables (including the padvanced), we applied factor analysis [26]. Table 5 shows the intercorrelation matrix between the features and the percentage of queries with operators (Padvanced). Each cell in the table contains the Pearsons correlation coefficient between the two features for a given row-column pair. Table 5. Intercorrelation matrix (query / result-click features). padv.

Columns 2 - 8 show the inter-correlations between the other features. There are strong positive correlations between some of the features (e.g., the number of words in the query (QWL) and the average probability of clicking on a search result (ACP)). However, there were also fairly strong negative correlations between some features (e.g., the average length of the queries (QWL) and the probability of clicking on a search result (CP)). The factor analysis revealed the presence of two factors that account for 83.6% of the variance. As is standard practice in factor analysis, all features with an absolute factor loading of .30 or less were removed. The two factors that emerged, with their respective loadings, can be expressed as: Factor A = .98(QRR) + .97(padv) + .97(QPS) + .71(ACP) + .69(QWL) Factor B = .96(CP) + .90(QPD) + .67(ACP) + .52(ASC) Variance in the query and result-click behavior of our advanced search engine users can be expressed using these two constructs. Factor A is the most powerful, contributing 50.5% of the variance. It appears to represent a very basic dimension of variance that covers query attributes and querying behavior, and suggests a relationship between query properties (length, frequency, complexity, and repetition) and the position of users clicks in the result list. The dimension underlying Factor B accounts for 33.1% of the variance, and describes attributes of result-click behavior, and a strong correlation between result clicks and the number of queries submitted each day. Summary: In this section we have shown that there are marked differences in aspects of the querying and result-clickthrough behaviors of advanced users relative to non-advanced users. We have also shown that the greater the proportion of queries that contain advanced syntax, the larger the differences in query and clickthrough behaviors become. A factor analysis revealed the presence of two dimensions that adequately characterize variance in the query and result-click features. In the querying dimension query attributes, such as the length and proportion that contain advanced syntax, and querying behavior, such as the number of queries submitted per day both affect result-click position. In addition, in the result-click dimension, it appears that daily querying frequency influences result-click features such as the likelihood that a user will click on a search result and the amount of time between result presentation and the search result click. The features used in this section are only interactions with search engines in the form of queries and result clicks. We did not address how users searched for information beyond the result page. In the next section we use the search trails described in Section 4 to analyze the post-query browsing behavior of users. 5.2 Post-query browsing behavior In this section we look at several attributes of the search trails users followed beyond the results page in an attempt to discern whether the use of advanced search syntax can be used as a predictor of aspects of post-query interaction behavior. As we did previously, we first describe the mean average values for each of the browsing features, across all advanced users (i.e. padvanced > 0%), all non-advanced users (i.e., padvanced = 0%), and all users regardless of their estimated search expertise level. We then look at the effect on the browsing features of increasing the value of padvanced required to be considered advanced from 1% to 100%. In Table 6 we present the average values for each of these features for the two groups of users. Also shown are the percentage of search trails (%Trails) and the percentage of users (%Users) used to compute the averages. Table 6. Post-query browsing features (per trail). Feature padvanced 0% > 0% â‰¥ 25% â‰¥ 50% â‰¥ 75% Session secs. 701.10 706.21 792.65 903.01 1114.71 Trail secs. 205.39 159.56 156.45 147.91 136.79 Display secs. 36.95 32.94 34.91 33.11 30.67 Num. steps 4.88 4.72 4.40 4.40 4.39 Num. backs 1.20 1.02 1.03 1.03 1.02 Num. branches 1.55 1.51 1.50 1.47 1.44 %Trails 72.14% 27.86% .83% .23% .05% %Users 79.90% 20.10% .79% .18% .04% As can be seen from Table 6, there are differences in the postquery interaction behaviors of advanced users (padvanced > 0%) relative to that do not use query operators in any of their queries (padvanced = 0%). Once again, the columns of interest in this comparison are bolded. As we did in Section 5.1 for query and result-click behavior, we performed an independent measures ttest between the values reported for each of the post-query browsing features. The results of this test suggest that differences between those that use advanced syntax and those that do not are significant (t(12495029) â‰¥ 3.09, p â‰¤ .002, Î± = .008). Given the sample sizes, all of the differences between means in the two groups were significant. However, we once again applied a Cohens d-test to determine the effect size. The findings (ranked in descending order based on effect size), show that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search engine users: â€¢ Revisit pages in the trail less often (d = .45) â€¢ Spend less time traversing each search trail (d = .38) â€¢ Spend less time viewing each document (d = .28) â€¢ Branch (i.e., proceed to new pages following a back operation) less often (d = .18) â€¢ Follow search trails with fewer steps (d = .16) It seems that advanced users use a more directed searching style than non-advanced users. They spend less time following search trails and view the documents that lie on those trails for less time. This is in accordance with our earlier proposition that advanced users seem able to discern document relevance in less time. Advanced users also tend to deviate less from a direct path as they search, with fewer revisits to previously-visited pages and less branching during their searching. As we did in the previous section, we increased the padvanced threshold one point at a time. With the exception of number of back operations (NB), the values attributable to each of the features change as padvanced increased. It seems that the differences noted earlier between non-advanced users and those that use any advanced syntax become more significant as padvanced increases. As in the previous section, we conducted a factor analysis of these features and padvanced. Table 7 shows the intercorrelation matrix for all these variables. Table 7. Intercorrelation matrix (post-query browsing). padv SS TS DS NS NB NBA padv 1.00 .977 âˆ’.843 âˆ’.867 âˆ’.395 âˆ’.339 âˆ’.249 SS 1.00 âˆ’.765 âˆ’.875 âˆ’.374 âˆ’.335 âˆ’.237 TS 1.00 .948 .387 .281 .250 DS 1.00 .392 .344 .257 NS 1.00 .891 .934 NB 1.00 .918 NBA 1.00 As the proportion of queries containing advanced syntax increases, the values of many of the post-query browsing features decrease. Only the average session time (SS) exhibits a strong positive correlation with padvanced. The factor analysis revealed the presence of two factors that account for 89.8% of the variance. Once again, all features with an absolute factor loading of .30 or less were removed. The two factors that emerged, with their respective loadings, can be expressed as: Factor A = .95(DS) + .88 (TS) âˆ’ .91(SS) âˆ’ .95(padv) Factor B = .99(NBA) + .93(NS) + .91(NB) Variance in the query and result-click behavior of those who use query operators can be expressed using these two constructs. Factor A is the most powerful, contributing 50.1% of the variance. It appears to represent a very basic temporal dimension that covers timing and percentage of queries with advanced syntax, and suggests a negative relationship between time spent searching and overall session time, and a negative relationship between time spent searching and padvanced. The navigation dimension underlying Factor B accounts for 39.7% of the variance, and describes attributes of post-query navigation, all of which seem to be strongly correlated with each other but not padvanced or timing. Summary: In this section we have shown that advanced users post-query browsing behavior appears more directed than that of non-advanced users. Although their search sessions are longer, advanced users follow fewer search trails during their sessions, (i.e., submit fewer queries), their search trails are shorter, and their trails exhibit fewer deviations or regressions to previously encountered pages. We also showed that as padvanced increases, session time increases (perhaps more advanced users are multitasking between search and other operations), and search interaction becomes more focused, perhaps because advanced users are able target relevant information more effectively, with less need for regressions or deviations in their search trails. As well as interaction behaviors such as queries, result clicks, and post-query browse behavior, another important aspect of the search process is the attainment of information relevant to the query. In the next section we analyze the success of advanced and non-advanced users in obtaining relevant information. 5.3 Search success As described earlier, we used six-level relevance judgments assigned to query-document pairs as an approximate measure of search success based on documents encountered on search trails. However, the queries for which we have judgments generally did not contain advanced operators. To maximize the likelihood of coverage we removed advanced operators from all queries when retrieving the relevance judgments. The mean average relevance judgment values for each of the four metrics - first, last, average, and maximum - are shown in Table 8 for non-advanced users (0%) and advanced users (> 0%). Table 8.

Not only were these users more successful in their searching, but they were consistently more successful (i.e., the standard deviation in relevance scores is lower for advanced users and continues to drop as padvanced increases). The differences in the four mean average relevance scores for each metric between these two user groups were significant with independent measures t-tests (all t(516765) â‰¥ 3.29, p â‰¤ .001, Î± = .0125). As we increase the value of padvanced as in previous sections, the average relevance score across all metrics also increases (all Pearsons R â‰¥ .654), suggesting that more advanced users are also more likely to succeed in their searching. The searchers that use advanced operators may have additional skills in locating relevant information, or may know where this information resides based on previous experience.3 Despite the fact that the four metrics targeted different parts of the search trail (e.g., first vs. last) or different ways to gather relevant information (e.g., average vs. maximum), the differences between groups and within the advanced group were consistent. 3 Although in our logs there was no obvious indication of more revisitation by advanced search engine users. To see whether there were any differences in the nature of the queries submitted by advanced search engine users, we studied the distribution of the four advanced operators: quotation marks, plus, minus, and site:. In Table 9 we show how these operators were distributed in all queries submitted by these users. Table 9. Distribution of query operators. Feature padvanced > 0% â‰¥ 25% â‰¥ 50% â‰¥ 75% Quotes () 71.08 77.09 70.33 70.00 Plus (+) 6.84 13.31 19.21 33.90 Minus (âˆ’) 6.62 2.88 1.96 2.42 Site: 21.55 12.72 13.04 9.86 Avg. num. operators 1.08 1.14 1.28 1.49 The distribution of the quotes, plus, and minus operators are similar amongst the four levels of padvanced, with quotes being the most popular of the four operators used. However, it appears that the plus operator is the main differentiator between the padvanced user groups. This operator, which forces the search engine to include in the query terms that are usually excluded by default (e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference in observed search success.4 However, this does not capture the contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in relevance compared with excluding the operator. To gain some insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the operators had on the relevance of retrieved results. We focused on queries in padvanced > 0% where the same user had issued a query without operators and the same query with operators either before or afterwards. Although there were few queries with matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with quotes in the initial query. It may be the case that quoted queries led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead to judged documents receiving higher scores. More analysis similar to [8] is required to test these propositions further. Summary: In this section we have used several measures to study the search success of advanced and non-advanced users. The findings of our analysis suggest that advanced search engine users are more successful and have more consistency in the relevance of the pages they visit. Their additional search expertise may make these users better able to make better decisions about which documents to view, meaning they encounter consistently more relevant information on their searches. In addition, within the group of advanced users there is a strong correlation between padvanced and the degree of search success. Advanced search engine users may be more adept at combining query operators to formulate powerful query statements. We now discuss the findings from all three subsections and their implications for the design of improved Web search systems. 4 It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google, Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search engine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced. 6. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not. Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19]. There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise. This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers. The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices. Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels. Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10]. The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems. In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29]. Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively. However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome. Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied. Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas. However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from. Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions. One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27]. It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements. However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching. However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success. Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching. These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit. Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do. As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training. Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.

White Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 ryenw@microsoft.com Dan Morris Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 Dan@microsoft.com Resumen Una forma de ayudar a ayudarTodos los usuarios de los motores de bÃºsqueda web comerciales tienen mÃ¡s Ã©xito en sus bÃºsquedas es comprender mejor lo que estÃ¡n haciendo esos usuarios con mayor experiencia en bÃºsqueda y usar este conocimiento para beneficiar a todos. En este artÃ­culo, estudiamos los registros de interacciÃ³n de los usuarios avanzados del motor de bÃºsqueda (y aquellos que no estÃ¡n tan avanzados) para comprender mejor cÃ³mo buscan estos grupos de usuarios. Los resultados muestran que existen diferencias marcadas en las consultas, los clics de los resultados, la navegaciÃ³n posterior a la Quera y el Ã©xito de bÃºsqueda de los usuarios que clasificamos como avanzados (segÃºn su uso de operadores de consultas), en relaciÃ³n con los clasificados como no avanzados. Nuestros hallazgos tienen implicaciones sobre cÃ³mo los usuarios avanzados deben ser compatibles durante sus bÃºsquedas, y cÃ³mo sus interacciones podrÃ­an usarse para ayudar a los buscadores de todos los niveles de experiencia a encontrar informaciÃ³n mÃ¡s relevante y aprender estrategias de bÃºsqueda mejoradas. CategorÃ­as y descriptores de sujetos H.3.3 [BÃºsqueda y recuperaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n]: formulaciÃ³n de consultas, proceso de bÃºsqueda, comentarios de relevancia. TÃ©rminos generales ExperimentaciÃ³n, factores humanos.1. IntroducciÃ³n La formulaciÃ³n de declaraciones de consulta que capturan los aspectos sobresalientes de las necesidades de informaciÃ³n y son significativos para los sistemas de recuperaciÃ³n de informaciÃ³n (IR) plantea un desafÃ­o para muchos buscadores [3]. Los motores de bÃºsqueda web comerciales como Google, Yahoo! Y Windows Live BÃºsqueda ofrecen a los usuarios la capacidad de mejorar la calidad de sus consultas utilizando operadores de consultas como comillas, mÃ¡s y menos letreros, y modificadores que restringen la bÃºsqueda a un sitio en particular otipo de archivo. Estas tÃ©cnicas pueden ser Ãºtiles para mejorar la precisiÃ³n de los resultados, aparte de los anÃ¡lisis de registro (por ejemplo, [15] [27]), generalmente han sido pasados por alto por la comunidad de investigaciÃ³n en intentos de mejorar la calidad de los resultados de bÃºsqueda. La investigaciÃ³n de IR generalmente se ha centrado en formas alternativas para que los usuarios especifiquen sus necesidades en lugar de aumentar la absorciÃ³n de la sintaxis avanzada. La investigaciÃ³n sobre tÃ©cnicas prÃ¡cticas para complementar la tecnologÃ­a de bÃºsqueda existente y los usuarios de soporte se han intensificado en los Ãºltimos aÃ±os (por ejemplo, [18] [34]). Sin embargo, es difÃ­cil implementar tales tÃ©cnicas a gran escala con latencias tolerables. Las consultas tÃ­picas enviadas a los motores de bÃºsqueda web toman la forma de una serie de tokens separados por espacios. En general, hay un booleano y operador implÃ­citos entre tokens que restringe los resultados de bÃºsqueda a los documentos que contienen todos los tÃ©rminos de consulta. De Lima y Pedersen [7] investigaron el efecto del anÃ¡lisis, el reconocimiento de frases y la expansiÃ³n en las consultas de bÃºsqueda web. Mostraron que el reconocimiento automÃ¡tico de frases en consultas puede mejorar la precisiÃ³n de los resultados en la bÃºsqueda web. Sin embargo, el valor de la sintaxis avanzada para los buscadores tÃ­picos generalmente ha sido limitado, ya que la mayorÃ­a de los usuarios no conocen la sintaxis avanzada o no entienden cÃ³mo usarla [15]. Dado que parece que los operadores pueden ayudar a recuperar documentos relevantes, se justifica una mayor investigaciÃ³n de su uso. En este documento exploramos el uso de operadores de consultas con mÃ¡s detalle y proponemos aplicaciones alternativas que no requieren que todos los usuarios usen sintaxis avanzada explÃ­citamente. Presumimos que los buscadores que usan sintaxis de consulta avanzada demuestran un grado de experiencia en bÃºsqueda que la mayorÃ­a de la poblaciÃ³n de usuarios no;Una afirmaciÃ³n respaldada por investigaciones anteriores [13]. Estudiar el comportamiento de estos usuarios avanzados del motor de bÃºsqueda puede producir informaciÃ³n importante sobre la bÃºsqueda y la navegaciÃ³n de resultados a partir del cual otros pueden beneficiarse. Utilizando registros recopilados de una gran cantidad de usuarios de consentimiento, investigamos las diferencias entre el comportamiento de bÃºsqueda de aquellos que usan sintaxis avanzada y aquellos que no, y diferencias en la informaciÃ³n que se dirigen a esos usuarios. Estamos interesados en responder tres preguntas de investigaciÃ³n: (i) Â¿Existe una relaciÃ³n entre el uso de sintaxis avanzada y otras caracterÃ­sticas de una bÃºsqueda?(ii) Â¿Existe una relaciÃ³n entre el uso de la sintaxis avanzada y los comportamientos de navegaciÃ³n posteriores a la quiry?(iii) Â¿Existe una relaciÃ³n entre el uso de la sintaxis avanzada y las medidas del Ã©xito de la bÃºsqueda? A travÃ©s de un estudio y anÃ¡lisis experimentales, ofrecemos respuestas potenciales para cada una de estas preguntas. Una relaciÃ³n entre el uso de la sintaxis avanzada y cualquiera de estas caracterÃ­sticas podrÃ­a admitir el diseÃ±o de sistemas adaptados a los usuarios avanzados de los motores de bÃºsqueda, o usar interacciones de usuarios avanzados para ayudar a los usuarios no avanzados a tener mÃ¡s Ã©xito en sus bÃºsquedas. Describimos el trabajo relacionado en la SecciÃ³n 2, los datos que utilizamos en este estudio basado en registros en la SecciÃ³n 3, las caracterÃ­sticas de bÃºsqueda en las que enfocamos nuestro anÃ¡lisis en la SecciÃ³n 4 y los resultados de este anÃ¡lisis en la SecciÃ³n 5. En la SecciÃ³n 6 discutimos las implicaciones de esta investigaciÃ³n, y concluimos en la SecciÃ³n 7. 2. Factores de trabajo relacionados, como la falta de conocimiento de dominio, la mala comprensiÃ³n de la recopilaciÃ³n de documentos que se busca y una necesidad de informaciÃ³n mal desarrollada puede influir en la calidad de las consultas que los usuarios presentan a los sistemas IR ([24], [28]). Ha habido una variedad de investigaciones sobre diferentes formas de ayudar a los usuarios a especificar sus necesidades de informaciÃ³n de manera mÃ¡s efectiva. Belkin et al.[4] ExperimentÃ³ al proporcionar espacio adicional para que los usuarios escriban una descripciÃ³n mÃ¡s detallada de sus necesidades de informaciÃ³n. Kelly et al. IntentÃ³ un enfoque similar.[18], quienes utilizaron formularios de aclaraciÃ³n para obtener informaciÃ³n adicional sobre el contexto de bÃºsqueda de los usuarios. Se ha demostrado que estos enfoques son efectivos en los sistemas de recuperaciÃ³n del mejor partido, donde las consultas mÃ¡s largas generalmente conducen a resultados de bÃºsqueda mÃ¡s relevantes [4]. Sin embargo, en la bÃºsqueda web, donde muchos de los sistemas se basan en un modelo de recuperaciÃ³n booleano extendido, las consultas mÃ¡s largas en realidad pueden daÃ±ar el rendimiento de la recuperaciÃ³n, lo que lleva a una pequeÃ±a cantidad de resultados potencialmente irrelevantes que se recuperan. No es simplemente suficiente solicitar mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n de los usuarios;Esta informaciÃ³n debe ser de mejor calidad. Comentarios de relevancia (RF) [22] y la expansiÃ³n de consultas interactivas [9] son tÃ©cnicas populares que se han utilizado para mejorar la calidad de la informaciÃ³n que los usuarios proporcionan a los sistemas IR con respecto a sus necesidades de informaciÃ³n. En el caso de RF, el usuario presenta al sistema ejemplos de informaciÃ³n relevante que luego se utilizan para formular una consulta mejorada o recuperar un nuevo conjunto de documentos. Ha demostrado ser difÃ­cil lograr que los usuarios usen RF en el dominio web debido a la dificultad para transmitir el significado y el beneficio de RF a los usuarios tÃ­picos [17]. Las sugerencias de consulta ofrecidas en funciÃ³n de los registros de consultas tienen el potencial de mejorar el rendimiento de la recuperaciÃ³n con una carga de usuario limitada. Este enfoque se limita a volver a ejecutar consultas populares, y los buscadores a menudo ignoran las sugerencias que se les presentan [1]. AdemÃ¡s, ambas tÃ©cnicas no ayudan a los usuarios a aprender a producir consultas mÃ¡s efectivas. La mayorÃ­a de los motores de bÃºsqueda comercial proporcionan una sintaxis de consulta avanzada que permite a los usuarios especificar sus necesidades de informaciÃ³n con mÃ¡s detalle. Los modificadores de consulta como + (mÃ¡s), - (menos) y (citas dobles) pueden usarse para enfatizar, enfatizar y los tÃ©rminos de consulta grupal. Los operadores booleanos (y, o, y no) pueden unir tÃ©rminos y frases, y modificadores como el sitio: y el enlace: se pueden usar para restringir el espacio de bÃºsqueda. Las consultas creadas con estas tÃ©cnicas pueden ser poderosas. Sin embargo, esta funcionalidad a menudo estÃ¡ oculta a la vista inmediata del buscador, y a menos que conozca la sintaxis, debe usar campos de texto, menÃºs desplegables y cuadros combinados disponibles a travÃ©s de una interfaz de bÃºsqueda avanzada dedicada para acceder a estas caracterÃ­sticas. El anÃ¡lisis basado en log de las interacciones de los usuarios con los motores de bÃºsqueda Excite y Altavista ha demostrado que solo el 10-20% de las consultas contenÃ­an cualquier sintaxis avanzada [14] [25]. Este anÃ¡lisis puede ser una forma Ãºtil de capturar las caracterÃ­sticas de los usuarios que interactÃºan con los sistemas IR. La investigaciÃ³n en modelado de usuarios [6] y personalizaciÃ³n [30] ha demostrado que recopilar mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n sobre los usuarios puede mejorar la efectividad de las bÃºsquedas, pero requiere mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n sobre los usuarios de lo que generalmente estÃ¡ disponible solo con los registros de interacciÃ³n. A menos que se combine con una tÃ©cnica cualitativa, como un cuestionario posterior a la sesiÃ³n [23], puede ser difÃ­cil asociar las interacciones con las caracterÃ­sticas del usuario. En nuestro estudio, conjeturamos que, dada la dificultad de ubicar las caracterÃ­sticas de bÃºsqueda avanzadas dentro de la interfaz de bÃºsqueda tÃ­pica, y los posibles problemas para comprender la sintaxis, aquellos usuarios que usan sintaxis avanzada representan regularmente una clase distinta de buscadores que exhibirÃ¡n otros comportamientos de bÃºsqueda comunes. Otros estudios de los comportamientos de bÃºsqueda de buscadores avanzados han intentado comprender mejor el conocimiento estratÃ©gico que han adquirido. Sin embargo, tales estudios generalmente tienen un tamaÃ±o limitado (por ejemplo, [13] [19]) o se centran en la experiencia en el dominio en Ã¡reas como la atenciÃ³n mÃ©dica o el comercio electrÃ³nico (por ejemplo, [5]). No obstante, pueden dar una visiÃ³n valiosa sobre los comportamientos de los usuarios con dominio, sistema o experiencia en bÃºsqueda que excede la del usuario promedio. La consulta del comportamiento en particular se ha estudiado ampliamente para comprender mejor a los usuarios [31] y admitir a otros usuarios [16]. En este artÃ­culo, estudiamos otras caracterÃ­sticas de bÃºsqueda de usuarios de sintaxis avanzada en un intento por determinar si hay algo diferente en cÃ³mo buscan estos usuarios de motores de bÃºsqueda y si sus bÃºsquedas pueden usarse para beneficiar a aquellos que no utilizan las caracterÃ­sticas avanzadas.de motores de bÃºsqueda. Para hacer esto, utilizamos registros de interacciÃ³n reunidos de un gran conjunto de usuarios de consentimiento durante un perÃ­odo prolongado. En la siguiente secciÃ³n describimos los datos que usamos para estudiar el comportamiento de los usuarios que usan sintaxis avanzada, en relaciÃ³n con aquellos que no usan esta sintaxis.3. Datos para realizar este estudio requerimos una descripciÃ³n del comportamiento de consulta y navegaciÃ³n de muchos buscadores, preferiblemente durante un perÃ­odo de tiempo para permitir que se analicen los patrones en el comportamiento del usuario. Para obtener estos datos, minamos los registros de interacciÃ³n de los usuarios web de consentimiento durante un perÃ­odo de 13 semanas, de enero a abril de 2006. Al descargar una aplicaciÃ³n del lado del cliente de Partner, los usuarios fueron invitados a consentir su interacciÃ³n con las pÃ¡ginas web que se registran de forma anÃ³nima (con un identificador Ãºnico asignado a cada usuario) y se utilizaron para mejorar el rendimiento de los sistemas futuros.1 La informaciÃ³n contenida en estosLas entradas de registro incluÃ­an un identificador Ãºnico para el usuario, una marca de tiempo para cada vista de pÃ¡gina, un identificador Ãºnico de ventana del navegador (para resolver ambigÃ¼edades para determinar quÃ© navegador se vio una pÃ¡gina) y la URL de la pÃ¡gina web visitada. Esto nos proporcionÃ³ datos suficientes sobre el comportamiento de consulta (desde la interacciÃ³n con los motores de bÃºsqueda) y el comportamiento de navegaciÃ³n (desde la interacciÃ³n con las pÃ¡ginas que siguen una bÃºsqueda) para investigar mÃ¡s ampliamente el comportamiento de bÃºsqueda. AdemÃ¡s de los datos recopilados durante el curso de este estudio, tambiÃ©n tuvimos juicios de relevancia de los documentos que los usuarios examinaron para 10,680 declaraciones de consulta Ãºnicas presentes en los registros de interacciÃ³n. Estos juicios fueron asignados en una escala de seis puntos por jueces humanos capacitados en el momento en que se recopilaron los datos. Utilizamos estos juicios en este anÃ¡lisis para evaluar la relevancia de los usuarios de sitios visitados en su rastro de navegaciÃ³n lejos de las pÃ¡ginas de resultados de bÃºsqueda. Estudiamos los registros de interacciÃ³n de 586,029 usuarios Ãºnicos, que enviaron millones de consultas a tres motores de bÃºsqueda populares GuinOogle, Yahoo!, Y MSN Search, durante las 13 semanas de duraciÃ³n del estudio. Para limitar el efecto del sesgo del motor de bÃºsqueda, utilizamos cuatro operadores comunes a los tres motores de bÃºsqueda: + (mÃ¡s), - (menos), (cotizaciones dobles) y el sitio: (para restringir la bÃºsqueda a un dominio o pÃ¡gina web)como sintaxis avanzada.El 1.12% de las consultas presentadas contenÃ­an al menos uno de estos cuatro operadores.51,080 (8.72%) de los usuarios usaron operadores de consultas en cualquiera de sus consultas. En el resto de este documento, nos referiremos a estos usuarios como buscadores avanzados. Reconocemos que la relaciÃ³n directa entre el uso de sintaxis de consulta y la experiencia en bÃºsqueda solo se ha estudiado 1, vale la pena seÃ±alar que si los usuarios no proporcionaron su consentimiento, entonces su interacciÃ³n no se registrÃ³ y analizÃ³ en este estudio.(y mostrado) en algunos estudios (por ejemplo, [13]), pero creemos que este es un criterio razonable para una investigaciÃ³n basada en log. Conjeturamos que estos buscadores avanzados poseen un alto nivel de experiencia en bÃºsqueda, y mostrarÃ¡n mÃ¡s adelante en el documento que demuestran caracterÃ­sticas de comportamiento consistentes con la experiencia en bÃºsqueda. Para manejar a los potenciales usuarios atÃ­picos que pueden sesgar nuestro anÃ¡lisis de datos, eliminamos a los usuarios que enviaron menos de 50 consultas en la duraciÃ³n de Studys de 13 semanas. Esto nos dejÃ³ con 188,405 usuarios, 37,795 (20.1%) usuarios avanzados y 150,610 (79.9%) usuarios no avanzados, cuyas interacciones estudiamos con mÃ¡s detalle. Si surgen diferencias significativas entre estos grupos, es concebible que estas interacciones puedan usarse para clasificar automÃ¡ticamente a los usuarios y ajustar una interfaz de sistemas de bÃºsqueda y una ponderaciÃ³n de resultados para que coincidan mejor con el usuario actual. La privacidad de nuestros voluntarios se mantuvo durante todo el curso del estudio: no se obtuvo informaciÃ³n personal sobre ellos, a los participantes se les asignÃ³ un identificador anÃ³nimo Ãºnico que no se remonta a ellos, y no hicimos ningÃºn intento de identificar un usuario en particular oEstudie el comportamiento individual de cualquier manera. Todos los hallazgos se agregaron en mÃºltiples usuarios, y no se obtuvo informaciÃ³n que no sea el consentimiento para el registro. Para obtener mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n sobre estos usuarios, estudiamos si aquellos que usan sintaxis avanzada exhibieron otros comportamientos de bÃºsqueda que no se observaron en aquellos que no usaron esta sintaxis. Nos centramos en la consulta, la navegaciÃ³n y el Ã©xito general de la bÃºsqueda para comparar los grupos de usuarios. En la siguiente secciÃ³n describimos con mÃ¡s detalle las caracterÃ­sticas de bÃºsqueda que utilizamos.4. CaracterÃ­sticas de bÃºsqueda que elegimos elegir caracterÃ­sticas que describieran una variedad de aspectos del proceso de bÃºsqueda: consultas, clics de resultados, navegaciÃ³n posterior a la quirada y Ã©xito de bÃºsqueda. La consulta y las caracterÃ­sticas de consulta que elegimos examinar se describen con mÃ¡s detalle en la Tabla 1. Tabla 1. Consulta y caracterÃ­sticas de clic de resultado (por usuario). CaracterÃ­stica que significa consultas por segundo (QPS) AVG.NÃºmero de consultas por segundo entre la consulta inicial y la fracciÃ³n de la tasa de repeticiÃ³n de consulta de fin de sesiÃ³n (QRR) de consultas que son repetidas longitud de palabra de consulta (QWL) AVG.NÃºmero de palabras en consultas consultas por dÃ­a (QPD) AVG.NÃºmero de consultas por dÃ­a avg.

Segundos para hacer clic (ASC) AVG.Busque para dar como resultado el intervalo de clic Estas siete caracterÃ­sticas nos dan una visiÃ³n general Ãºtil de los usuarios interacciones directas con los motores de bÃºsqueda, pero no de cÃ³mo los usuarios buscan informaciÃ³n relevante mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de la pÃ¡gina de resultados o cuÃ¡n exitosos tienen en la ubicaciÃ³n de la informaciÃ³n relevante. Por lo tanto, ademÃ¡s de estas caracterÃ­sticas, tambiÃ©n estudiamos algunos aspectos relevantes del comportamiento de navegaciÃ³n posterior a la Cuter. Para hacer esto, extrajimos senderos de bÃºsqueda de los registros de interacciÃ³n descritos en la secciÃ³n anterior. Un rastro de bÃºsqueda es una serie de pÃ¡ginas web visitadas conectadas a travÃ©s de un sendero de hipervÃ­nculo, iniciado con una pÃ¡gina de resultados de bÃºsqueda y terminando en uno de los siguientes eventos: navegaciÃ³n a cualquier pÃ¡gina no vinculada desde la pÃ¡gina actual, cierre de la ventana del navegador activo, oUn tiempo de espera de inactividad de sesiÃ³n de 30 minutos. Se proporcionan mÃ¡s detalles sobre la extracciÃ³n de los senderos de bÃºsqueda en trabajos anteriores [33]. En total, se extrajeron alrededor de 12.5 millones de senderos de bÃºsqueda (que contienen alrededor de 60 millones de documentos) de los registros para todos los usuarios. El nÃºmero medio de senderos de bÃºsqueda por usuario fue de 30. El nÃºmero medio de pasos en los senderos fue de 3. Todos los senderos de bÃºsqueda contenÃ­an una pÃ¡gina de resultados de bÃºsqueda y al menos una pÃ¡gina en una ruta de hipervÃ­nculo que conduce desde la pÃ¡gina de resultados. La extracciÃ³n de estos senderos nos permitiÃ³ estudiar aspectos del comportamiento de navegaciÃ³n posterior a la cuota, a saber, la duraciÃ³n promedio de las sesiones de bÃºsqueda de usuarios, la duraciÃ³n promedio de los senderos de bÃºsqueda de los usuarios, el tiempo promedio de visualizaciÃ³n de cada documento, el nÃºmero promedio de pasos en los senderos de bÃºsqueda de usuarios,El nÃºmero de sucursales en los patrones de navegaciÃ³n de los usuarios y el nÃºmero de operaciones posteriores en los senderos de bÃºsqueda de usuarios. Todos los senderos de bÃºsqueda contienen al menos una rama que representa cualquier movimiento hacia adelante en la ruta de navegaciÃ³n. Un sendero puede tener ramas adicionales si el usuario hace clic en el botÃ³n de retroceso de los navegadores e inmediatamente avanza a otra pÃ¡gina antes de la siguiente (si la hay) operaciÃ³n de retroceso. Las caracterÃ­sticas de navegaciÃ³n posterior a la QUIE se describen mÃ¡s adelante en la Tabla 2. Tabla 2. CaracterÃ­sticas de navegaciÃ³n posterior a la cuarta (por sendero). CaracterÃ­stica Significa la longitud promedio de la sesiÃ³n de la sesiÃ³n de segundos de sesiÃ³n (SS) (en segundos).

Backs (NBA) NÃºmero promedio de operaciones posteriores, asÃ­ como el uso de estos atributos de las interacciones de los usuarios, tambiÃ©n utilizamos los juicios de relevancia descritos anteriormente en el documento para medir el grado de Ã©xito de la bÃºsqueda en funciÃ³n de los juicios de relevancia asignados a las pÃ¡ginas que se encuentran en la bÃºsquedacamino. Dado que no tenÃ­amos acceso a evaluaciones de relevancia de nuestros usuarios, se aproximamos a estas evaluaciones utilizando juicios recopilados como parte de la investigaciÃ³n en curso sobre el rendimiento del motor de bÃºsqueda. 2 Estos juicios fueron creados por asesores humanos capacitados para 10,680 consultas Ãºnicas. De los 1.420,625 pasos en los senderos de bÃºsqueda que comenzaron con cualquiera de estas consultas, tenemos juicios de relevancia para 802,160 (56.4%). Utilizamos estos juicios para aproximar el Ã©xito de la bÃºsqueda de un sendero dado de varias maneras. En la Tabla 3 enumeramos estas medidas.2 Nuestra evaluaciÃ³n del Ã©xito de la bÃºsqueda es bastante cruda en comparaciÃ³n con lo que hubiera sido posible si hubiÃ©ramos podido contactar a nuestros sujetos. Abordamos este problema de manera similar al utilizado por la Conferencia de recuperaciÃ³n de texto (TREC) [21], ya que dado que no podemos determinar el Ã©xito de bÃºsqueda percibido, aproximamos el Ã©xito de la bÃºsqueda basado en decenas de relevancia asignadas de documentos visitados. Tabla 3. Medidas de juicio de relevancia (por sendero). Medida significado que el primer juicio asignado a la primera pÃ¡gina en el sendero Final Judy Assignada a la Ãºltima pÃ¡gina en el juicio promedio promedio del sendero en todas las pÃ¡ginas en el sendero juicio mÃ¡ximo mÃ¡ximo en todas las pÃ¡ginas en el sendero Estas medidas se usan durante nuestro anÃ¡lisis para estimar elRelevancia de las pÃ¡ginas vistas en diferentes etapas en los senderos y nos permite estimar el Ã©xito de la bÃºsqueda de diferentes maneras. Elegimos mÃºltiples medidas, ya que los usuarios pueden encontrar informaciÃ³n relevante de muchas maneras y en diferentes puntos del sendero (por ejemplo, un documento Ãºnico altamente creloso o gradualmente en el transcurso del sendero). Las caracterÃ­sticas descritas en esta secciÃ³n nos permitieron analizar atributos importantes del proceso de bÃºsqueda que deben entenderse mejor si queremos apoyar a los usuarios en su bÃºsqueda. En la siguiente secciÃ³n presentamos los hallazgos del anÃ¡lisis.5. Hallazgos Nuestro anÃ¡lisis se divide en tres partes: AnÃ¡lisis del comportamiento de consulta e interacciÃ³n con la pÃ¡gina de resultados, anÃ¡lisis del comportamiento de navegaciÃ³n posterior a la Quera y el Ã©xito de la bÃºsqueda en tÃ©rminos de localizaciÃ³n de documentos de relevantes jueces. Se usan pruebas estadÃ­sticas paramÃ©tricas y el nivel de importancia para las pruebas estadÃ­sticas se establece en .05.5.1 Consulta y comportamiento de clic de resultados Nos interesaron en comparar la consulta y los comportamientos de consulta con clic de nuestros usuarios avanzados y no avanzados. En la Tabla 4 mostramos los valores promedio medios para cada una de las siete funciones de bÃºsqueda para nuestros usuarios. Usamos Padvanced para denotar el porcentaje de todas las consultas de cada usuario que contiene sintaxis avanzada (es decir, Padvanced = 0% significa que un usuario nunca usÃ³ sintaxis avanzada). La tabla muestra valores para los usuarios que no usan operadores de consultas (0%), usuarios que presentaron al menos una consulta con los operadores (â‰¥ 0%), a los usuarios cuyas consultas contenÃ­an operadores al menos tres cuartos del tiempo (â‰¥ 75%). Tabla 4. Consulta y resulta caracterÃ­sticas de clic (por usuario).

Las columnas correspondientes a estos dos grupos estÃ¡n en negrita en la Tabla 4. Realizamos una TTEST de medidas independientes entre estos grupos para cada una de las caracterÃ­sticas. Dado que este anÃ¡lisis involucrÃ³ muchas caracterÃ­sticas, utilizamos una correcciÃ³n de Bonferroni para controlar la tasa de error en tÃ©rminos de experimento y establecer el nivel alfa (Î±) en .007, es decir, .05 dividido por el nÃºmero de caracterÃ­sticas. Esta correcciÃ³n reduce el nÃºmero de errores de tipo I, es decir, rechazando hipÃ³tesis nulas que son verdaderas. Todas las diferencias entre los grupos fueron estadÃ­sticamente significativas (todas T (188403) â‰¥ 2.81, todas p â‰¤ .002). Sin embargo, dados los grandes tamaÃ±os de muestra, es probable que todas las diferencias en las medias fueran estadÃ­sticamente significativas. Aplicamos una prueba D de Cohen para determinar el tamaÃ±o del efecto para cada una de las comparaciones entre los grupos de usuarios avanzados y no avanzados. Pedido en orden descendente por tamaÃ±o del efecto, los hallazgos principales son que en relaciÃ³n con los usuarios no avanzados, usuarios avanzados del motor de bÃºsqueda: â€¢ Consulta con menos frecuencia en una sesiÃ³n (d = 1.98) â€¢ Componga consultas mÃ¡s largas (d = .69) â€¢ Haga clic mÃ¡s lejosAbajo la lista de resultados (d = .67) â€¢ EnvÃ­e mÃ¡s consultas por dÃ­a (d = .49) â€¢ Es menos probable que haga clic en un resultado (d = .32) â€¢ Repetir consultas con mÃ¡s frecuencia (d = .16) El aumento del aumentoLa probabilidad de que los usuarios avanzados del motor de bÃºsqueda hagan clic mÃ¡s abajo en la lista de resultados implica que pueden confiar menos en la capacidad de los motores de bÃºsqueda para clasificar primero el documento mÃ¡s relevante, que estÃ©n mÃ¡s dispuestos a explorar mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de las pÃ¡ginas mÃ¡s populares para una consulta dada,que pueden estar presentando diferentes tipos de consultas (por ejemplo, informativo en lugar de navegaciÃ³n), o que pueden haber personalizado su configuraciÃ³n de bÃºsqueda para mostrar mÃ¡s que solo los resultados predeterminados de los 10 mejores. Muchos de los hallazgos enumerados son consistentes con los identificados en otros estudios de consultas avanzadas de consultas y clics de consulta [13] [34]. Dado que el Ãºnico criterio que empleamos para clasificar a un usuario como buscador avanzado fue su uso de la sintaxis avanzada, ciertamente es prometedor que este criterio parece identificar a los usuarios que interactÃºan de manera consistente con la que se informÃ³ anteriormente para aquellos con mÃ¡s experiencia en bÃºsqueda. Como se mencionÃ³ anteriormente, los usuarios avanzados del motor de bÃºsqueda para los cuales se calculan los valores promedio que se muestran en la Tabla 4 son aquellos que envÃ­an 50 o mÃ¡s consultas en la duraciÃ³n de 13 semanas de la recopilaciÃ³n de datos y envÃ­an al menos una consulta que contiene operadores de consultas avanzadas. En otras palabras, consideramos a los usuarios cuyo porcentaje de consultas que contienen sintaxis avanzada, padvanced, es mayor que cero. El uso de operadores de consultas en cualquier consulta, independientemente de la frecuencia, sugiere que un usuario conoce la existencia de los operadores e implica un mayor grado de familiaridad con el sistema de bÃºsqueda. AdemÃ¡s, planteamos la hipÃ³tesis de que los usuarios cuyas consultas contenÃ­an con mayor frecuencia la sintaxis avanzada puede ser usuarios de motores de bÃºsqueda mÃ¡s avanzados. Para probar esto, investigamos variando el umbral de consulta requerido para calificar para el estado avanzado (Remado). Incrementamos un punto porcentual enrigados a la vez, y registramos los valores de las siete caracterÃ­sticas de consulta y clic en cada punto. Los valores de las caracterÃ­sticas a cuatro hitos (> 0%, â‰¥ 25%, â‰¥ 50%y â‰¥ 75%) se muestran en la Tabla 4. Como se puede ver en la tabla, a medida que aumenta el padvanced, las diferencias en las caracterÃ­sticas entre las que usan sintaxis avanzada y aquellos que no usan sintaxis avanzada se vuelven mÃ¡s sustanciales. Sin embargo, es interesante observar que a medida que aumenta el enriquecedor, el nÃºmero de consultas presentadas por dÃ­a en realidad cae (Pearsons R = âˆ’.512, t (98) = 5.98, p <.0001). Los usuarios mÃ¡s avanzados pueden necesitar representar menos consultas para encontrar informaciÃ³n relevante. Para estudiar los patrones de relaciÃ³n entre estas variables dependientes (incluido el padvanced), aplicamos el anÃ¡lisis factorial [26]. La Tabla 5 muestra la matriz de intercorrelaciÃ³n entre las caracterÃ­sticas y el porcentaje de consultas con operadores (remadrado). Cada celda de la tabla contiene el coeficiente de correlaciÃ³n de los Pearson entre las dos caracterÃ­sticas para un par de columna de fila dada. Tabla 5.

Las columnas 2 - 8 muestran las intercorrelaciones entre las otras caracterÃ­sticas. Existen fuertes correlaciones positivas entre algunas de las caracterÃ­sticas (por ejemplo, el nÃºmero de palabras en la consulta (QWL) y la probabilidad promedio de hacer clic en un resultado de bÃºsqueda (ACP)). Sin embargo, tambiÃ©n hubo correlaciones negativas bastante fuertes entre algunas caracterÃ­sticas (por ejemplo, la longitud promedio de las consultas (QWL) y la probabilidad de hacer clic en un resultado de bÃºsqueda (CP)). El anÃ¡lisis factorial revelÃ³ la presencia de dos factores que representan el 83.6% de la varianza. Al igual que la prÃ¡ctica estÃ¡ndar en el anÃ¡lisis factorial, se eliminaron todas las caracterÃ­sticas con una carga de factor absoluta de .30 o menos. Los dos factores que surgieron, con sus respectivas cargas, pueden expresarse como: factor A = .98 (QRR) + .97 (PADV) + .97 (QPS) + .71 (ACP) + .69 (QWL) B Factor B= .96 (CP) + .90 (QPD) + .67 (ACP) + .52 (ASC) Varianza en la consulta y el comportamiento de clic de nuestros usuarios avanzados del motor de bÃºsqueda se puede expresar utilizando estas dos construcciones. El factor A es el mÃ¡s poderoso, contribuyendo con el 50.5% de la varianza. Parece representar una dimensiÃ³n de varianza muy bÃ¡sica que cubre los atributos de consulta y el comportamiento de consulta, y sugiere una relaciÃ³n entre las propiedades de consulta (longitud, frecuencia, complejidad y repeticiÃ³n) y la posiciÃ³n de los usuarios hace clic en la lista de resultados. El factor B subyacente de la dimensiÃ³n representa el 33.1% de la varianza, y describe los atributos del comportamiento de clic de resultados, y una fuerte correlaciÃ³n entre los clics de los resultados y el nÃºmero de consultas presentadas cada dÃ­a. Resumen: en esta secciÃ³n hemos demostrado que existen diferencias marcadas en los aspectos de las consultas y los comportamientos de consulta de los usuarios avanzados en relaciÃ³n con los usuarios no avanzados. TambiÃ©n hemos demostrado que cuanto mayor sea la proporciÃ³n de consultas que contienen sintaxis avanzada, mayores son las diferencias en la consulta y los comportamientos de clic. Un anÃ¡lisis factorial revelÃ³ la presencia de dos dimensiones que caracterizan adecuadamente la varianza en la consulta y las caracterÃ­sticas de consulta. En los atributos de consulta de dimensiÃ³n de consulta, como la longitud y la proporciÃ³n que contienen sintaxis avanzada, y el comportamiento de consulta, como el nÃºmero de consultas presentadas por dÃ­a, ambas afectan la posiciÃ³n de clic del resultado. AdemÃ¡s, en la dimensiÃ³n de clic en el resultado, parece que la frecuencia de consulta diaria influye en las caracterÃ­sticas de clic en el resultado, como la probabilidad de que un usuario haga clic en un resultado de bÃºsqueda y la cantidad de tiempo entre la presentaciÃ³n del resultado y el resultado del resultado de la bÃºsqueda. Las caracterÃ­sticas utilizadas en esta secciÃ³n son solo interacciones con motores de bÃºsqueda en forma de consultas y clics de resultados. No abordamos cÃ³mo los usuarios buscaron informaciÃ³n mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de la pÃ¡gina de resultados. En la siguiente secciÃ³n, utilizamos los senderos de bÃºsqueda descritos en la SecciÃ³n 4 para analizar el comportamiento de navegaciÃ³n posterior a la Query de los usuarios.5.2 Comportamiento de navegaciÃ³n posterior a la Cuter En esta secciÃ³n. Observamos varios atributos de los senderos de bÃºsqueda que los usuarios siguieron mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de la pÃ¡gina de resultados en un intento de discernir si el uso de la sintaxis de bÃºsqueda avanzada puede usarse como un predictor de aspectos del comportamiento de interacciÃ³n posterior.. Como lo hicimos anteriormente, primero describimos los valores promedio medios para cada una de las caracterÃ­sticas de navegaciÃ³n, en todos los usuarios avanzados (es decir, Padvanced> 0%), todos los usuarios no avanzados (es decir, Padvanced = 0%) y todos los usuarios, independientemente de los usuarios deSu nivel de experiencia de bÃºsqueda estimado. Luego observamos el efecto sobre las caracterÃ­sticas de navegaciÃ³n de aumentar el valor de la remadida requerida para ser considerada avanzada del 1% al 100%. En la Tabla 6 presentamos los valores promedio para cada una de estas caracterÃ­sticas para los dos grupos de usuarios. TambiÃ©n se muestran el porcentaje de senderos de bÃºsqueda (%senderos) y el porcentaje de usuarios (%de usuarios) utilizado para calcular los promedios. Tabla 6.

Una vez mÃ¡s, las columnas de interÃ©s en esta comparaciÃ³n estÃ¡n en negrita. Como lo hicimos en la SecciÃ³n 5.1 para la consulta y el comportamiento de clic en el resultado, realizamos una TTEST de medidas independientes entre los valores reportados para cada una de las caracterÃ­sticas de navegaciÃ³n posteriores a la Quera. Los resultados de esta prueba sugieren que las diferencias entre las que usan sintaxis avanzada y las que no lo hacen son significativas (t (12495029) â‰¥ 3.09, p â‰¤ .002, Î± = .008). Dados los tamaÃ±os de muestra, todas las diferencias entre medias en los dos grupos fueron significativas. Sin embargo, una vez mÃ¡s aplicamos una prueba D de Cohen para determinar el tamaÃ±o del efecto. Los hallazgos (clasificados en orden descendente basado en el tamaÃ±o del efecto) muestran que en relaciÃ³n con los usuarios no avanzados, usuarios avanzados del motor de bÃºsqueda: â€¢ Revise las pÃ¡ginas en el sendero con menos frecuencia (d = .45) â€¢ Pase menos tiempo atravesando cada rastro de bÃºsqueda (d = .38) â€¢ Pase menos tiempo viendo cada documento (d = .28) â€¢ Rama (es decir, proceda a nuevas pÃ¡ginas despuÃ©s de una operaciÃ³n de retroceso) con menos frecuencia (d = .18) â€¢ Siga los senderos de bÃºsqueda con menos pasos (d =.16) Parece que los usuarios avanzados usan un estilo de bÃºsqueda mÃ¡s dirigido que los usuarios no avanzados. Pasan menos tiempo despuÃ©s de senderos de bÃºsqueda y ven los documentos que se encuentran en esos senderos por menos tiempo. Esto estÃ¡ de acuerdo con nuestra proposiciÃ³n anterior de que los usuarios avanzados parecen capaces de discernir la relevancia del documento en menos tiempo. Los usuarios avanzados tambiÃ©n tienden a desviarse menos de una ruta directa mientras buscan, con menos revisiones a pÃ¡ginas previamente visitadas y menos ramificaciÃ³n durante su bÃºsqueda. Como lo hicimos en la secciÃ³n anterior, aumentamos el umbral enriquecido un punto a la vez. Con la excepciÃ³n del nÃºmero de operaciones posteriores (NB), los valores atribuibles a cada una de las caracterÃ­sticas cambian a medida que aumentÃ³ el remonente. Parece que las diferencias observadas anteriormente entre los usuarios no avanzados y aquellos que usan cualquier sintaxis avanzada se vuelven mÃ¡s significativas a medida que aumenta la potencia. Como en la secciÃ³n anterior, realizamos un anÃ¡lisis factorial de estas caracterÃ­sticas y enriquecidos. La Tabla 7 muestra la matriz de intercorrelaciÃ³n para todas estas variables. Tabla 7. Matriz de intercorrelaciÃ³n (navegaciÃ³n posterior a la Cuter).PADV SS TS DS NS NB NBA PADV 1.00 .977 âˆ’.843 âˆ’.867 âˆ’.395 âˆ’.339 âˆ’.249 SS 1.00 âˆ’.765 âˆ’.875 âˆ’.374 âˆ’.335 âˆ’.237 TS 1.00 .948 .387.281 .250 ds 1.00 .392 .344 .257 ns 1.00 .891 .934 NB 1.00 .918 NBA 1.00 A medida que aumenta la proporciÃ³n de consultas que contienen sintaxis avanzada, los valores de muchas de las caracterÃ­sticas de navegaciÃ³n posterior a la quiry disminuyen. Solo el tiempo de sesiÃ³n promedio (SS) exhibe una fuerte correlaciÃ³n positiva con Radvanced. El anÃ¡lisis factorial revelÃ³ la presencia de dos factores que representan el 89.8% de la varianza. Una vez mÃ¡s, se eliminaron todas las caracterÃ­sticas con una carga de factor absoluto de .30 o menos. Los dos factores que surgieron, con sus respectivas cargas, pueden expresarse como: factor A = .95 (DS) + .88 (TS) - .91 (SS) - .95 (PADV) Factor B = .99 (NBA)+ .93 (NS) + .91 (NB) La varianza en la consulta y el comportamiento de consulta de los que usan operadores de consultas pueden expresarse utilizando estas dos construcciones. El factor A es el mÃ¡s poderoso, contribuyendo con el 50.1% de la varianza. Parece representar una dimensiÃ³n temporal muy bÃ¡sica que cubre el tiempo y el porcentaje de consultas con sintaxis avanzada, y sugiere una relaciÃ³n negativa entre el tiempo dedicado al tiempo de bÃºsqueda y el tiempo general de la sesiÃ³n, y una relaciÃ³n negativa entre el tiempo dedicado a buscar y remonchar. La dimensiÃ³n de navegaciÃ³n subyacente al factor B representa el 39.7% de la varianza, y describe los atributos de la navegaciÃ³n posterior al Cuareria, todos los cuales parecen estar fuertemente correlacionados entre sÃ­, pero no conmovidos o sincronizaciÃ³n. Resumen: en esta secciÃ³n hemos demostrado que los usuarios avanzados del comportamiento de navegaciÃ³n posterior a la Quera parece mÃ¡s dirigida a los de los usuarios no avanzados. Aunque sus sesiones de bÃºsqueda son mÃ¡s largas, los usuarios avanzados siguen menos senderos de bÃºsqueda durante sus sesiones (es decir, presentan menos consultas), sus senderos de bÃºsqueda son mÃ¡s cortos y sus senderos exhiben menos desviaciones o regresiones a pÃ¡ginas previamente encontradas. TambiÃ©n demostramos que a medida que aumenta el tiempo potente, el tiempo de sesiÃ³n aumenta (quizÃ¡s los usuarios mÃ¡s avanzados sean multitarea entre la bÃºsqueda y otras operaciones), y la interacciÃ³n de bÃºsqueda se centra mÃ¡s, tal vez porque los usuarios avanzados pueden dirigirse a la informaciÃ³n relevante de manera mÃ¡s efectiva, con menos necesidad de regresiones o regresiones oDesviaciones en sus senderos de bÃºsqueda. AdemÃ¡s de los comportamientos de interacciÃ³n, como consultas, clics de resultados y comportamiento de navegaciÃ³n posterior a la Quera, otro aspecto importante del proceso de bÃºsqueda es el logro de la informaciÃ³n relevante para la consulta. En la siguiente secciÃ³n analizamos el Ã©xito de los usuarios avanzados y no avanzados para obtener informaciÃ³n relevante.5.3 El Ã©xito de la bÃºsqueda Como se describiÃ³ anteriormente, utilizamos juicios de relevancia de seis niveles asignados a pares de documentos de consulta como una medida aproximada del Ã©xito de bÃºsqueda basado en documentos encontrados en los senderos de bÃºsqueda. Sin embargo, las consultas para las cuales tenemos juicios generalmente no contenÃ­an operadores avanzados. Para maximizar la probabilidad de cobertura, eliminamos a los operadores avanzados de todas las consultas al recuperar los juicios de relevancia. Los valores medios de juicio de relevancia promedio para cada una de las cuatro mÃ©tricas, primero, Ãºltimo, promedio y mÃ¡ximo, se muestran en la Tabla 8 para usuarios no avanzados (0%) y usuarios avanzados (> 0%).

Estos usuarios no solo tuvieron mÃ¡s Ã©xito en su bÃºsqueda, sino que tambiÃ©n tuvieron mÃ¡s Ã©xito (es decir, la desviaciÃ³n estÃ¡ndar en los puntajes de relevancia es menor para los usuarios avanzados y continÃºa disminuyendo a medida que aumenta el enriquecimiento). Las diferencias en los cuatro puntajes de relevancia promedio media para cada mÃ©trica entre estos dos grupos de usuarios fueron significativas con medidas t de medidas t (todas T (516765) â‰¥ 3.29, p â‰¤ .001, Î± = .0125). A medida que aumentamos el valor de Padvanced como en secciones anteriores, el puntaje de relevancia promedio en todas las mÃ©tricas tambiÃ©n aumenta (todas las Pearson R â‰¥ .654), lo que sugiere que los usuarios mÃ¡s avanzados tambiÃ©n tienen mÃ¡s probabilidades de tener Ã©xito en su bÃºsqueda. Los buscadores que usan operadores avanzados pueden tener habilidades adicionales para localizar informaciÃ³n relevante, o pueden saber dÃ³nde reside esta informaciÃ³n en funciÃ³n de la experiencia previa.3 A pesar del hecho de que las cuatro mÃ©tricas se dirigieron a diferentes partes del rastro de bÃºsqueda (por ejemplo, primero vs. Ãšltimo)o diferentes formas de recopilar informaciÃ³n relevante (por ejemplo, promedio versus mÃ¡ximo), las diferencias entre los grupos y dentro del grupo avanzado fueron consistentes.3 Aunque en nuestros registros no hubo una indicaciÃ³n obvia de mÃ¡s revisiones por parte de los usuarios avanzados de los motores de bÃºsqueda. Para ver si hubo diferencias en la naturaleza de las consultas presentadas por los usuarios avanzados del motor de bÃºsqueda, estudiamos la distribuciÃ³n de los cuatro operadores avanzados: comillas, mÃ¡s, menos y sitio:. En la Tabla 9 mostramos cÃ³mo se distribuyeron estos operadores en todas las consultas presentadas por estos usuarios. Tabla 9. DistribuciÃ³n de operadores de consultas. CaracterÃ­stica Padvanced> 0% â‰¥ 25% â‰¥ 50% â‰¥ 75% cotizaciones () 71.08 77.09 70.33 70.00 Plus (+) 6.84 13.31 19.21 33.90 menos ( -) 6.62 2.88 1.96 2.42 Sitio: 21.55 12.72 13.04 9.86 AVG.numerOperadores 1.08 1.14 1.28 1.49 La distribuciÃ³n de las cotizaciones, mÃ¡s y menos, los operadores son similares entre los cuatro niveles de padvanced, siendo las citas el mÃ¡s popular de los cuatro operadores utilizados. Sin embargo, parece que el operador Plus es el principal diferenciador entre los grupos de usuarios enrollados. Este operador, que obliga al motor de bÃºsqueda a incluir en los tÃ©rminos de consulta que generalmente se excluyen de forma predeterminada (por ejemplo, el, a), puede explicar alguna parte de la diferencia en el Ã©xito de bÃºsqueda observada.4 Sin embargo, esto no captura la contribuciÃ³n queCada uno de estos operadores tiene el aumento de la relevancia en comparaciÃ³n con la exclusiÃ³n del operador. Para obtener una idea de esto, examinamos el impacto que cada uno de los operadores tuvo sobre la relevancia de los resultados recuperados. Nos centramos en las consultas en Padvanced> 0% donde el mismo usuario habÃ­a emitido una consulta sin operadores y la misma consulta con los operadores, ya sea antes o despuÃ©s. Aunque hubo pocas consultas con pares coincidentes, y casi todas ellas contenÃ­an citas, hubo un pequeÃ±o aumento (aproximadamente del 10%) en el puntaje de juicio de relevancia promedio asignado a documentos en el camino con citas en la consulta inicial. Puede ser el caso que las consultas citadas condujeron a la recuperaciÃ³n de documentos mÃ¡s relevantes, o que mejoren mejor las necesidades percibidas de jueces de relevancia y, por lo tanto, conducen a documentos juzgados que reciben puntajes mÃ¡s altos. Se requiere mÃ¡s anÃ¡lisis similar a [8] para probar estas proposiciones mÃ¡s. Resumen: en esta secciÃ³n hemos utilizado varias medidas para estudiar el Ã©xito de bÃºsqueda de usuarios avanzados y no avanzados. Los resultados de nuestro anÃ¡lisis sugieren que los usuarios avanzados del motor de bÃºsqueda tienen mÃ¡s Ã©xito y tienen mÃ¡s consistencia en la relevancia de las pÃ¡ginas que visitan. Su experiencia de bÃºsqueda adicional puede hacer que estos usuarios sean mejoras para tomar mejores decisiones sobre quÃ© documentos ver, lo que significa que se encuentran consistentemente mÃ¡s informaciÃ³n relevante en sus bÃºsquedas. AdemÃ¡s, dentro del grupo de usuarios avanzados existe una fuerte correlaciÃ³n entre Padvanced y el grado de Ã©xito de la bÃºsqueda. Los usuarios avanzados del motor de bÃºsqueda pueden ser mÃ¡s expertos en combinar operadores de consultas para formular poderosas declaraciones de consulta. Ahora discutimos los hallazgos de las tres subsecciones y sus implicaciones para el diseÃ±o de sistemas de bÃºsqueda web mejorados.4 Vale la pena seÃ±alar que no hubo diferencias significativas en la distribuciÃ³n del uso de los tres motores de bÃºsqueda: Google, Yahoo!, O Windows Live Search, entre los usuarios avanzados de los motores de bÃºsqueda, o entre usuarios avanzados y no avanzados.6. DiscusiÃ³n e implicaciones Nuestros hallazgos indican diferencias significativas en la consulta, el hecho de hacer clic, la navegaciÃ³n posterior a la Quera y el Ã©xito de la bÃºsqueda de aquellos que usan sintaxis avanzada versus aquellos que no lo hacen. Muchos de estos hallazgos reflejan los que ya se encuentran en estudios previos con grupos de novatos y expertos autoidentificados [13] [19]. Hay varias formas en que un sistema de motores de bÃºsqueda comercial podrÃ­a beneficiarse de una indicaciÃ³n cuantitativa de experiencia en bÃºsqueda. Esta podrÃ­a ser otra caracterÃ­stica disponible para un motor de clasificaciÃ³n;es decir, puede ser el caso que los buscadores expertos en algunos casos prefieran diferentes pÃ¡ginas que los buscadores novatos. La interfaz de usuario para un motor de bÃºsqueda puede adaptarse a un nivel de experiencia de los usuarios;QuizÃ¡s las caracterÃ­sticas aÃºn mÃ¡s avanzadas, como la ponderaciÃ³n de tÃ©rmino y las sugerencias de expansiÃ³n de consultas, podrÃ­an presentarse a los buscadores mÃ¡s experimentados al tiempo que preservan la simplicidad de la interfaz bÃ¡sica para los novatos. La presentaciÃ³n de resultados tambiÃ©n puede personalizarse en funciÃ³n del nivel de habilidad de bÃºsqueda;El trabajo futuro podrÃ­a reevaluar los beneficios de los fragmentos de contenido, las miniaturas, etc. de una manera que permita diferentes resultados para diferentes niveles de experiencia. AdemÃ¡s, si hay historias de navegaciÃ³n disponibles, los destinos de los buscadores avanzados podrÃ­an usarse como resultados sugeridos para consultas, evitando y potencialmente mejorando el proceso de bÃºsqueda tradicional [10]. El uso de la interacciÃ³n de los usuarios avanzados del motor de bÃºsqueda para guiar a otros con menos experiencia es una propuesta atractiva para los diseÃ±adores de los sistemas de bÃºsqueda. En parte, estos buscadores pueden tener mÃ¡s experiencia de navegaciÃ³n posterior a la cuarta que les permite superar las deficiencias de los sistemas de bÃºsqueda [29]. Sus interacciones se pueden usar para apuntar a los usuarios a lugares que visitan los usuarios de motores de bÃºsqueda avanzados [32] o simplemente para capacitar a los buscadores menos experimentados cÃ³mo buscar de manera mÃ¡s efectiva. Sin embargo, si los usuarios expertos se utilizarÃ¡n de esta manera, deberÃ¡n superarse los problemas de escasez de datos. Nuestros usuarios avanzados solo representaron el 20.1% de los usuarios cuyas interacciones estudiamos. Si bien estos pueden estar entre los usuarios mÃ¡s activos, es poco probable que vean documentos que cubren una gran cantidad de Ã¡reas temÃ¡ticas. Sin embargo, en lugar de centrarse en dÃ³nde van (lo que quizÃ¡s sea mÃ¡s apropiado para aquellos con conocimiento del dominio), los usuarios avanzados de los motores de bÃºsqueda pueden usar movimientos, tÃ¡cticas y estrategias [2] de las que los usuarios sin experiencia pueden aprender. Alentar a los usuarios a usar sintaxis avanzada les ayuda a aprender cÃ³mo formular mejores consultas de bÃºsqueda;Aprovechar el estilo de bÃºsqueda de los buscadores expertos podrÃ­a ayudarlos a aprender mÃ¡s interacciones exitosas posteriores a la quereria. Una posible limitaciÃ³n a los resultados que informamos es que en investigaciones anteriores, se ha demostrado que los operadores de consultas no mejoran significativamente la efectividad de los resultados de bÃºsqueda web [8], y que los buscadores pueden funcionar tan bien sin ellos [27] Por lo tanto, se podrÃ­a argumentar que los usuarios que no usan operadores de consultas estÃ¡n mÃ¡s avanzados, ya que no pierden el tiempo usando sintaxis potencialmente redundante en sus declaraciones de consulta. Sin embargo, esto parece poco probable dado que aquellos que usan sintaxis avanzada exhibieron comportamientos de bÃºsqueda tÃ­picos de los usuarios con experiencia [13], y tienen mÃ¡s Ã©xito en su bÃºsqueda. Sin embargo, en el trabajo futuro nos ampliaremos la definiciÃ³n de usuarios avanzados mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de los atributos de la consulta para incluir tambiÃ©n otros comportamientos de interacciÃ³n, algunos de los cuales hemos definido en este estudio y otras vÃ­as de investigaciÃ³n como el seguimiento ocular [12].7. Conclusiones En este documento, hemos descrito un estudio basado en registros del comportamiento de bÃºsqueda en la web que ha demostrado que el uso de la sintaxis de bÃºsqueda avanzada se correlaciona con otros aspectos del comportamiento de bÃºsqueda, como consultas, resultados de resultados, navegaciÃ³n posterior a la quirera y bÃºsqueda de bÃºsqueda y bÃºsqueda de bÃºsquedaÃ©xito. Aquellos que usan esta sintaxis estÃ¡n activos en lÃ­nea durante mÃ¡s tiempo, pasan menos tiempo consultando y atravesando senderos de bÃºsqueda, exhiben menos desviaciÃ³n en sus senderos, tienen mÃ¡s probabilidades de explorar los resultados de bÃºsqueda, tomar menos tiempo para hacer clic en los resultados y tienen mÃ¡s Ã©xito en la bÃºsqueda.. Todos estos son rasgos que esperarÃ­amos que los buscadores expertos exhiban. La clasificaciÃ³n cruda de usuarios basada en una sola caracterÃ­stica que se puede extraer fÃ¡cilmente de la secuencia de consultas produce resultados notables sobre el comportamiento de interacciÃ³n de los usuarios que no usan la sintaxis y las que sÃ­ lo hacen. Como hemos sugerido, los sistemas de bÃºsqueda pueden aprovechar las interacciones de estos usuarios para mejorar la clasificaciÃ³n de documentos, la recomendaciÃ³n de la pÃ¡gina o incluso la capacitaciÃ³n del usuario. El trabajo futuro incluirÃ¡ el desarrollo de interfaces de bÃºsqueda y motores de recuperaciÃ³n modificados que utilicen estas caracterÃ­sticas ricas en informaciÃ³n, e investigaciÃ³n adicional sobre el uso de estas caracterÃ­sticas como indicadores de experiencia en bÃºsqueda, incluido un anÃ¡lisis de correlaciÃ³n cruzada entre el clic de resultados y la publicaciÃ³n posterior.Comportamiento de consulta.8.

        "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
        "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
        "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
        "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
        "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",

(ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",
        "Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions.",

        "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
        "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
        "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
        "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
        "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
        "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
        "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
        "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",
        "Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden.",
        "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",

        "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
        "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
        "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
        "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
        "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
        "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
        "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
        "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",

        "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
        "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
        "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
        "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
        "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
        "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
        "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
        "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
        "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
        "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
        "This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail.",
        "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
        "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
        "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
        "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
        "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
        "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",
        "SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.",
        "The query and result-click characteristics we chose to examine are described in more detail in Table 1.",
        "Table 1.",
        "Query and result-click features (per user).",
        "Feature Meaning Queries Per Second (QPS) Avg. number of queries per second between initial query and end-of-session Query Repeat Rate (QRR) Fraction of queries that are repeats Query Word Length (QWL) Avg. number of words in query Queries Per Day (QPD) Avg. number of queries per day Avg.",
        "Click Position (ACP) Avg. rank of clicked results Click Probability (CP) Ratio of result clicks to queries Avg.",
        "Seconds To Click (ASC) Avg. search to result click interval These seven features give us a useful overview of users direct interactions with search engines, but not of how users are looking for relevant information beyond the result page or how successful they are in locating relevant information.",
        "Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior.",
        "To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.",
        "A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.",
        "More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].",
        "In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.",
        "The median number of search trails per user was 30.",
        "The median number of steps in the trails was 3.",
        "All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.",
        "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
        "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",
        "A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.",
        "The post-query browsing features are described further in Table 2.",
        "Table 2.",
        "Post-query browsing features (per trail).",
        "Feature Meaning Session Seconds (SS) Average session length (in seconds) Trail Seconds (TS) Average trail length (in seconds) Display Seconds (DS) Average display time for each page on the trail (in seconds) Num.",

        "Branches (NB) Average number of branches Num.",
        "Backs (NBA) Average number of back operations As well as using these attributes of users interactions, we also used the relevance judgments described earlier in the paper to measure the degree of search success based on the relevance judgments assigned to pages that lie on the search trail.",
        "Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries.",
        "Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%).",
        "We use these judgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a number of ways.",
        "In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.",
        "We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.",
        "Table 3.",
        "Relevance judgment measures (per trail).",
        "Measure Meaning First Judgment assigned to the first page in the trail Last Judgment assigned to the last page in the trail Average Average judgment across all pages in the trail Maximum Maximum judgment across all pages in the trail These measures are used during our analysis to estimate the relevance of the pages viewed at different stages in the trails, and allow us to estimate search success in different ways.",
        "We chose multiple measures, as users may encounter relevant information in many ways and at different points in the trail (e.g., single highlyrelevant document or gradually over the course of the trail).",
        "The features described in this section allowed us to analyze important attributes of the search process that must be better understood if we are to support users in their searching.",
        "In the next section we present the findings of the analysis. 5.",
        "FINDINGS Our analysis is divided into three parts: analysis of query behavior and interaction with the results page, analysis of post-query navigation behavior, and search success in terms of locating judged-relevant documents.",
        "Parametric statistical testing is used, and the level of significance for the statistical tests is set to .05. 5.1 Query and result-click behavior We were interested in comparing the query and result-click behaviors of our advanced and non-advanced users.",
        "In Table 4 we show the mean average values for each of the seven search features for our users.",
        "We use padvanced to denote the percentage of all queries from each user that contains advanced syntax (i.e., padvanced = 0% means a user never used advanced syntax).",
        "The table shows values for users that do not use query operators (0%), users who submitted at least one query with operators (â‰¥ 0%), through to users whose queries contained operators at least threequarters of the time (â‰¥ 75%).",

        "The columns corresponding to these two groups are bolded in Table 4.",
        "We performed an independent measures ttest between these groups for each of the features.",
        "Since this analysis involved many features, we use a Bonferroni correction to control the experiment-wise error rate and set the alpha level (Î±) to .007, i.e., .05 divided by the number of features.",
        "This correction reduces the number of Type I errors i.e., rejecting null hypotheses that are true.",
        "All differences between the groups were statistically significant (all t(188403) â‰¥ 2.81, all p â‰¤ .002).",
        "However, given the large sample sizes, all differences in the means were likely to be statistically significant.",
        "We applied a Cohens d-test to determine the effect size for each of the comparisons between the advanced and non-advanced user groups.",
        "Ordering in descending order by effect size, the main findings are that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search engine users: â€¢ Query less frequently in a session (d = 1.98) â€¢ Compose longer queries (d = .69) â€¢ Click further down the result list (d = .67) â€¢ Submit more queries per day (d = .49) â€¢ Are less likely to click on a result (d = .32) â€¢ Repeat queries more often (d = .16) The increased likelihood that advanced search engine users will click further down the result list implies that they may be less trusting of the search engines ability to rank the most relevant document first, that they are more willing to explore beyond the most popular pages for a given query, that they may be submitting different types of queries (e.g., informational rather than navigational), or that they may have customized their search settings to display more than only the default top-10 results.",
        "Many of the findings listed are consistent with those identified in other studies of advanced searchers querying and result-click behaviors [13][34].",
        "Given that the only criteria we employed to classify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced syntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to identify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported previously for those with more search expertise.",
        "As mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which the average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who submit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data collection and submit at least one query containing advanced query operators.",
        "In other words, we consider users whose percentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is greater than zero.",
        "The use of query operators in any queries, regardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the existence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of familiarity with the search system.",
        "We further hypothesized that users whose queries more frequently contained advanced syntax may be more advanced search engine users.",
        "To test this we investigated varying the query threshold required to qualify for advanced status (padvanced).",
        "We incremented padvanced one percentage point at a time, and recorded the values of the seven query and result-click features at each point.",
        "The values of the features at four milestones (> 0%, â‰¥ 25%, â‰¥ 50%, and â‰¥ 75%) are shown in Table 4.",
        "As can be seen in the table, as padvanced increases, differences in the features between those using advanced syntax and those not using advanced syntax become more substantial.",
        "However, it is interesting to note that as padvanced increases, the number of queries submitted per day actually falls (Pearsons R = âˆ’.512, t(98) = 5.98, p < .0001).",
        "More advanced users may need to pose fewer queries to find relevant information.",
        "To study the patterns of relationship among these dependent variables (including the padvanced), we applied factor analysis [26].",

        "However, it appears that the plus operator is the main differentiator between the padvanced user groups.",
        "This operator, which forces the search engine to include in the query terms that are usually excluded by default (e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference in observed search success.4 However, this does not capture the contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in relevance compared with excluding the operator.",
        "To gain some insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the operators had on the relevance of retrieved results.",
        "We focused on queries in padvanced > 0% where the same user had issued a query without operators and the same query with operators either before or afterwards.",
        "Although there were few queries with matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with quotes in the initial query.",
        "It may be the case that quoted queries led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead to judged documents receiving higher scores.",
        "More analysis similar to [8] is required to test these propositions further.",
        "Summary: In this section we have used several measures to study the search success of advanced and non-advanced users.",
        "The findings of our analysis suggest that advanced search engine users are more successful and have more consistency in the relevance of the pages they visit.",
        "Their additional search expertise may make these users better able to make better decisions about which documents to view, meaning they encounter consistently more relevant information on their searches.",
        "In addition, within the group of advanced users there is a strong correlation between padvanced and the degree of search success.",
        "Advanced search engine users may be more adept at combining query operators to formulate powerful query statements.",
        "We now discuss the findings from all three subsections and their implications for the design of improved Web search systems. 4 It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google, Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search engine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced. 6.",
        "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
        "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
        "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
        "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
        "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
        "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
        "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
        "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
        "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
        "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
        "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
        "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
        "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
        "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
        "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
        "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
        "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
        "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
        "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
        "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
        "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
        "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
        "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
        "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
        "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
                "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",

                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",

                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",

                "We now discuss the findings from all three subsections and their implications for the design of improved Web search systems. 4 It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google, Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced <br>search engine</br> users, or between advanced users and non-advanced. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
                "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
                "There are several ways in which a commercial <br>search engine</br> system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a <br>search engine</br> might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced <br>search engine</br> users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced <br>search engine</br> users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced <br>search engine</br> users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",

                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between <br>query</br> syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",

                "However, it appears that the plus operator is the main differentiator between the padvanced user groups.",
                "This operator, which forces the search engine to include in the <br>query</br> terms that are usually excluded by default (e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference in observed search success.4 However, this does not capture the contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in relevance compared with excluding the operator.",
                "To gain some insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the operators had on the relevance of retrieved results.",

                "Although there were few queries with matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with quotes in the initial <br>query</br>.",
                "It may be the case that quoted queries led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead to judged documents receiving higher scores.",

                "Summary: In this section we have used several measures to study the search success of advanced and non-advanced users.",
                "The findings of our analysis suggest that advanced search engine users are more successful and have more consistency in the relevance of the pages they visit.",
                "Their additional search expertise may make these users better able to make better decisions about which documents to view, meaning they encounter consistently more relevant information on their searches.",

                "We now discuss the findings from all three subsections and their implications for the design of improved Web search systems. 4 It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google, Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search engine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-<br>query</br> navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
                "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
                "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and <br>query</br> expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-<br>query</br> browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-<br>query</br> interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that <br>query</br> operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use <br>query</br> operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their <br>query</br> statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the <br>query</br> to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-<br>query</br> navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the <br>query</br> stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-<br>query</br> behavior. 8.",

White Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 ryenw@microsoft.com Dan Morris Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 dan@microsoft.com ABSTRACT One way to help all users of commercial Web search engines be more successful in their searches is to better understand what those users with greater search expertise are doing, and use this knowledge to benefit everyone.",
                "In this paper we study the interaction logs of advanced search engine users (and those not so advanced) to better understand how these user groups search.",
                "The results show that there are marked differences in the queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators), relative to those classified as non-advanced.",
                "Our findings have implications for how advanced users should be supported during their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help searchers of all experience levels find more <br>relevant information</br> and learn improved searching strategies.",

                "INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].",
                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
                "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",
                "Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]).",
                "However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.",
                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
                "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",
                "Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.",
                "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",
                "We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",
                "Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions.",
                "A relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or use advanced users interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches.",
                "We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this analysis in Section 5.",
                "In Section 6 we discuss the implications of this research, and we conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]).",
                "There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively.",
                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of <br>relevant information</br> that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",
                "Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden.",
                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), âˆ’ (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",
                "Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space.",
                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
                "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",
                "SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.",
                "The query and result-click characteristics we chose to examine are described in more detail in Table 1.",
                "Table 1.",
                "Query and result-click features (per user).",

                "Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior.",
                "To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.",
                "A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.",
                "More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].",
                "In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.",
                "The median number of search trails per user was 30.",
                "The median number of steps in the trails was 3.",
                "All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.",
                "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
                "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",
                "A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.",
                "The post-query browsing features are described further in Table 2.",
                "Table 2.",

                "Backs (NBA) Average number of back operations As well as using these attributes of users interactions, we also used the relevance judgments described earlier in the paper to measure the degree of search success based on the relevance judgments assigned to pages that lie on the search trail.",
                "Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries.",
                "Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%).",
                "We use these judgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a number of ways.",
                "In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.",
                "We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.",

                "Ordering in descending order by effect size, the main findings are that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search engine users: â€¢ Query less frequently in a session (d = 1.98) â€¢ Compose longer queries (d = .69) â€¢ Click further down the result list (d = .67) â€¢ Submit more queries per day (d = .49) â€¢ Are less likely to click on a result (d = .32) â€¢ Repeat queries more often (d = .16) The increased likelihood that advanced search engine users will click further down the result list implies that they may be less trusting of the search engines ability to rank the most relevant document first, that they are more willing to explore beyond the most popular pages for a given query, that they may be submitting different types of queries (e.g., informational rather than navigational), or that they may have customized their search settings to display more than only the default top-10 results.",
                "Many of the findings listed are consistent with those identified in other studies of advanced searchers querying and result-click behaviors [13][34].",
                "Given that the only criteria we employed to classify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced syntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to identify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported previously for those with more search expertise.",
                "As mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which the average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who submit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data collection and submit at least one query containing advanced query operators.",
                "In other words, we consider users whose percentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is greater than zero.",
                "The use of query operators in any queries, regardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the existence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of familiarity with the search system.",

                "To test this we investigated varying the query threshold required to qualify for advanced status (padvanced).",
                "We incremented padvanced one percentage point at a time, and recorded the values of the seven query and result-click features at each point.",

                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",

                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
                "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",

                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",

                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",

                "However, it appears that the plus operator is the main differentiator between the padvanced user groups.",
                "This operator, which forces the search engine to include in the query terms that are usually excluded by default (e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference in observed search success.4 However, this does not capture the contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in relevance compared with excluding the operator.",
                "To gain some insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the operators had on the relevance of retrieved results.",
                "We focused on queries in padvanced > 0% where the same user had issued a query without operators and the same query with operators either before or afterwards.",
                "Although there were few queries with matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with quotes in the initial query.",
                "It may be the case that quoted queries led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead to judged documents receiving higher scores.",

                "Summary: In this section we have used several measures to study the search success of advanced and non-advanced users.",
                "The findings of our analysis suggest that advanced search engine users are more successful and have more consistency in the relevance of the pages they visit.",
                "Their additional search expertise may make these users better able to make better decisions about which documents to view, meaning they encounter consistently more relevant information on their searches.",
                "In addition, within the group of advanced users there is a strong correlation between padvanced and the degree of search success.",
                "Advanced search engine users may be more adept at combining query operators to formulate powerful query statements.",
                "We now discuss the findings from all three subsections and their implications for the design of improved Web search systems. 4 It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google, Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search engine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
                "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
                "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",

                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

(iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",

                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",

                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), âˆ’ (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",

                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any <br>advanced syntax</br> [14][25].",

                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use <br>advanced syntax</br> regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",

                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as <br>advanced syntax</br>. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using <br>advanced syntax</br> exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",

                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",

                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",

                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use <br>advanced syntax</br> helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use <br>advanced syntax</br> exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",

                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",

(ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",

                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",

                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",

                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",

                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",

                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",

                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "Our findings have implications for how advanced users should be supported during their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help searchers of all experience levels find more relevant information and learn improved searching strategies.",

                "INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].",
                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
                "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",
                "Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]).",
                "However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.",
                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
                "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",
                "Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.",
                "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the <br>search behavior</br> of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",
                "We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",
                "Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions.",
                "A relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or use advanced users interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches.",

                "In Section 6 we discuss the implications of this research, and we conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]).",
                "There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively.",
                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",
                "Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden.",
                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), âˆ’ (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",
                "Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space.",
                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate <br>search behavior</br>.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
                "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",
                "SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.",

                "Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior.",
                "To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.",
                "A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.",
                "More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].",
                "In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.",

                "The median number of steps in the trails was 3.",
                "All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.",
                "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
                "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",
                "A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.",

                "Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries.",
                "Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%).",

                "In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.",
                "We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.",

                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",

                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",

                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of <br>search behavior</br> on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of <br>search behavior</br> such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",

                "INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].",
                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
                "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",
                "Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]).",
                "However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.",
                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
                "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",
                "Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.",
                "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",
                "We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of <br>search success</br>?",

                "RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]).",
                "There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively.",
                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",
                "Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden.",
                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), âˆ’ (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",
                "Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space.",
                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",

                "However, it appears that the plus operator is the main differentiator between the padvanced user groups.",
                "This operator, which forces the search engine to include in the query terms that are usually excluded by default (e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference in observed <br>search success</br>4 However, this does not capture the contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in relevance compared with excluding the operator.",
                "To gain some insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the operators had on the relevance of retrieved results.",
                "We focused on queries in padvanced > 0% where the same user had issued a query without operators and the same query with operators either before or afterwards.",
                "Although there were few queries with matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with quotes in the initial query.",
                "It may be the case that quoted queries led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead to judged documents receiving higher scores.",
                "More analysis similar to [8] is required to test these propositions further.",
                "Summary: In this section we have used several measures to study the <br>search success</br> of advanced and non-advanced users.",
                "The findings of our analysis suggest that advanced search engine users are more successful and have more consistency in the relevance of the pages they visit.",
                "Their additional search expertise may make these users better able to make better decisions about which documents to view, meaning they encounter consistently more relevant information on their searches.",
                "In addition, within the group of advanced users there is a strong correlation between padvanced and the degree of <br>search success</br>.",
                "Advanced search engine users may be more adept at combining query operators to formulate powerful query statements.",
                "We now discuss the findings from all three subsections and their implications for the design of improved Web search systems. 4 It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google, Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search engine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and <br>search success</br> of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
                "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
                "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and <br>search success</br>.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

White Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 ryenw@microsoft.com Dan Morris Microsoft Research One Microsoft Way Redmond, WA 98052 dan@microsoft.com ABSTRACT One way to help all users of commercial Web search engines be more successful in their searches is to better understand what those users with greater search expertise are doing, and use this knowledge to benefit everyone.",
                "In this paper we study the interaction logs of advanced search engine users (and those not so advanced) to better understand how these user groups search.",
                "The results show that there are marked differences in the queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators), relative to those classified as non-advanced.",
                "Our findings have implications for how advanced users should be supported during their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help searchers of all experience levels find more relevant information and learn improved searching strategies.",

                "INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].",
                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
                "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",
                "Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]).",
                "However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.",
                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
                "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",
                "Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.",
                "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",
                "We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",
                "Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions.",
                "A relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or use advanced users interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches.",
                "We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this analysis in Section 5.",
                "In Section 6 we discuss the implications of this research, and we conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]).",
                "There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively.",
                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "<br>relevance feedback</br> (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",
                "Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden.",
                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), âˆ’ (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",
                "Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space.",
                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
                "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",
                "SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.",

                "Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior.",
                "To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.",
                "A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.",
                "More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].",
                "In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.",
                "The median number of search trails per user was 30.",
                "The median number of steps in the trails was 3.",
                "All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.",
                "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
                "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",
                "A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.",

                "Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries.",
                "Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%).",
                "We use these judgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a number of ways.",
                "In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.",
                "We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.",

                "However, given the large sample sizes, all differences in the means were likely to be statistically significant.",

                "Ordering in descending order by effect size, the main findings are that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search engine users: â€¢ Query less frequently in a session (d = 1.98) â€¢ Compose longer queries (d = .69) â€¢ Click further down the result list (d = .67) â€¢ Submit more queries per day (d = .49) â€¢ Are less likely to click on a result (d = .32) â€¢ Repeat queries more often (d = .16) The increased likelihood that advanced search engine users will click further down the result list implies that they may be less trusting of the search engines ability to rank the most relevant document first, that they are more willing to explore beyond the most popular pages for a given query, that they may be submitting different types of queries (e.g., informational rather than navigational), or that they may have customized their search settings to display more than only the default top-10 results.",

                "Given that the only criteria we employed to classify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced syntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to identify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported previously for those with more search expertise.",
                "As mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which the average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who submit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data collection and submit at least one query containing advanced query operators.",
                "In other words, we consider users whose percentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is greater than zero.",
                "The use of query operators in any queries, regardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the existence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of familiarity with the search system.",

                "To test this we investigated varying the query threshold required to qualify for advanced status (padvanced).",

                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",

                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",

                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",

                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",

                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",

                "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",

                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), âˆ’ (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",

                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had <br>relevance</br> judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the <br>relevance</br> of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",

                "In addition, within the group of advanced users there is a strong correlation between padvanced and the degree of search success.",
                "Advanced search engine users may be more adept at combining query operators to formulate powerful query statements.",
                "We now discuss the findings from all three subsections and their implications for the design of improved Web search systems. 4 It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google, Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search engine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
                "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
                "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "The results show that there are marked differences in the queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators), relative to those classified as non-advanced.",
                "Our findings have implications for how advanced users should be supported during their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help searchers of all experience levels find more relevant information and learn improved searching strategies.",

                "INTRODUCTION The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].",
                "Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search to a particular site or type of file.",
                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",
                "IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced syntax.",
                "Research on practical techniques to supplement existing search technology and support users has been intensifying in recent years (e.g. [18][34]).",
                "However, it is challenging to implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.",
                "Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of a series of tokens separated by spaces.",
                "There is generally an implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts search results to documents containing all query terms.",
                "De Lima and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase recognition, and expansion on Web search queries.",
                "They showed that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve result precision in Web search.",
                "However, the value of advanced syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand how to use it [15].",
                "Since it appears operators can help retrieve relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.",
                "In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to use advanced syntax explicitly.",
                "We hypothesize that searchers who use advanced <br>query syntax</br> demonstrate a degree of search expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an assertion supported by previous research [13].",
                "Studying the behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield important insights about searching and result browsing from which others may benefit.",
                "Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we investigate differences between the search behavior of those that use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the information those users target.",
                "We are interested in answering three research questions: (i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and other characteristics of a search? (ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and post-query navigation behaviors? (iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax and measures of search success?",
                "Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential answers for each of these questions.",
                "A relationship between the use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or use advanced users interactions to help non-advanced users be more successful in their searches.",
                "We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this analysis in Section 5.",
                "In Section 6 we discuss the implications of this research, and we conclude in Section 7. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed information need can all influence the quality of the queries that users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]).",
                "There has been a variety of research into different ways of helping users specify their information needs more effectively.",
                "Belkin et al. [4] experimented with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose description of their information needs.",
                "A similar approach was attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to elicit additional information about the search context from users.",
                "These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more relevant search results [4].",
                "However, in Web search, where many of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model, longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved.",
                "It is not simply sufficient to request more information from users; this information must be of better quality.",
                "Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion [9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding their information needs.",
                "In the case of RF, the user presents the system with examples of relevant information that are then used to formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.",
                "It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF to typical users [17].",
                "Query suggestions offered based on query logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with limited user burden.",
                "This approach is limited to re-executing popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions presented to them [1].",
                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced <br>query syntax</br> that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",
                "Query modifiers such as + (plus), âˆ’ (minus), and  (double quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query terms.",
                "Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used to restrict the search space.",
                "Queries created with these techniques can be powerful.",
                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between <br>query syntax</br> usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
                "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",
                "SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.",

                "Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior.",
                "To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.",
                "A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.",
                "More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].",
                "In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.",
                "The median number of search trails per user was 30.",
                "The median number of steps in the trails was 3.",
                "All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.",
                "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
                "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",
                "A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.",

                "Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries.",
                "Of the 1,420,625 steps on search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%).",
                "We use these judgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a number of ways.",
                "In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.",
                "We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.",

                "Ordering in descending order by effect size, the main findings are that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search engine users: â€¢ Query less frequently in a session (d = 1.98) â€¢ Compose longer queries (d = .69) â€¢ Click further down the result list (d = .67) â€¢ Submit more queries per day (d = .49) â€¢ Are less likely to click on a result (d = .32) â€¢ Repeat queries more often (d = .16) The increased likelihood that advanced search engine users will click further down the result list implies that they may be less trusting of the search engines ability to rank the most relevant document first, that they are more willing to explore beyond the most popular pages for a given query, that they may be submitting different types of queries (e.g., informational rather than navigational), or that they may have customized their search settings to display more than only the default top-10 results.",
                "Many of the findings listed are consistent with those identified in other studies of advanced searchers querying and result-click behaviors [13][34].",
                "Given that the only criteria we employed to classify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced syntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to identify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported previously for those with more search expertise.",
                "As mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which the average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who submit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data collection and submit at least one query containing advanced query operators.",
                "In other words, we consider users whose percentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is greater than zero.",
                "The use of query operators in any queries, regardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the existence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of familiarity with the search system.",
                "We further hypothesized that users whose queries more frequently contained advanced syntax may be more advanced search engine users.",
                "To test this we investigated varying the query threshold required to qualify for advanced status (padvanced).",
                "We incremented padvanced one percentage point at a time, and recorded the values of the seven query and result-click features at each point.",
                "The values of the features at four milestones (> 0%, â‰¥ 25%, â‰¥ 50%, and â‰¥ 75%) are shown in Table 4.",

                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",

                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",

                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",

                "These techniques can be useful in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g., [15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.",

                "In addition, both of these techniques do not help users learn to produce more effective queries.",
                "Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.",

                "However, this functionality is often hidden from the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to access these features.",
                "Log-based analysis of users interactions with the Excite and AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries contained any advanced syntax [14][25].",
                "This analysis can be a useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR systems.",
                "Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30] has shown that gathering more information about users can improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more information about users than is typically available from interaction logs alone.",
                "Unless coupled with a qualitative technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics.",
                "In our study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced search features within the typical search interface, and the potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.",
                "Other studies of advanced searchers search behaviors have attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have acquired.",
                "However, such studies are generally limited in size (e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]).",
                "Nonetheless, they can give valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system, or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.",
                "Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to better understand users [31] and support other users [16].",
                "In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is anything different about how these search engine users search, and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do not make use of the advanced features of search engines.",
                "To do this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting users over a prolonged period.",
                "In the next section we describe the data we use to study the behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those that do not use this syntax. 3.",
                "DATA To perform this study we required a description of the querying and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.",
                "To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.",
                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",

                "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect expert searchers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",

                "When downloading a partner client-side application, the users were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1 The information contained in these log entries included a unique identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page visited.",
                "This provided us with sufficient data on querying behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to more broadly investigate search behavior.",
                "In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.",
                "These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained human judges at the time the data were collected.",
                "We use these judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.",
                "We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who submitted millions of queries to three popular search enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of the study.",
                "To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), âˆ’ (minus),  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of users used query operators in any of their queries.",
                "In the remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced searchers.",
                "We acknowledge that the direct relationship between query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied 1 It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study. (and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation.",
                "We conjecture that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.",
                "To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis, we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the studys 13-week duration.",
                "This left us with 188,405 users âˆ’ 37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) nonadvanced users âˆ’ whose interactions we study in more detail.",
                "If significant differences emerge between these groups, it is conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically classify users and adjust a search systems interface and result weighting to better match the current user.",
                "The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in any way.",
                "All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and no information other than consent for logging was elicited.",
                "To find out more about these users we studied whether those using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were not observed in those who did not use this syntax.",
                "We focused on querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the user groups.",
                "In the next section we describe in more detail the search features that we used. 4.",
                "SEARCH FEATURES We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success.",

                "Therefore, in addition to these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of users post-query browsing behavior.",
                "To do this, we extracted search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous section.",
                "A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes.",
                "More detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in previous work [33].",
                "In total, around 12.5 million search trails (containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the logs for all users.",
                "The median number of search trails per user was 30.",
                "The median number of steps in the trails was 3.",
                "All search trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a hyperlink trail leading from the result page.",
                "The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users search sessions, the average duration of users search trails, the average display time of each document, the average number of steps in users search trails, the number of branches in users navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users search trails.",
                "All search trails contain at least one branch representing any forward motion on the browse path.",
                "A trail can have additional branches if the user clicks the browsers back button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to the next (if any) back operation.",

                "Given that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our users, we approximated these assessments using judgments collected as part of ongoing research into search engine performance.2 These judgments were created by trained human assessors for 10,680 unique queries.",

                "In Table 3 we list these measures. 2 Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to what would have been possible if we had been able to contact our subjects.",
                "We address this problem in a manner similar to that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that since we cannot determine perceived search success, we approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores of visited documents.",

                "As well as interaction behaviors such as queries, result clicks, and post-query browse behavior, another important aspect of the search process is the attainment of information relevant to the query.",
                "In the next section we analyze the success of advanced and non-advanced users in obtaining relevant information. 5.3 Search success As described earlier, we used six-level relevance judgments assigned to query-document pairs as an approximate measure of search success based on documents encountered on search trails.",

                "This operator, which forces the search engine to include in the query terms that are usually excluded by default (e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference in observed search success.4 However, this does not capture the contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in relevance compared with excluding the operator.",
                "To gain some insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the operators had on the relevance of retrieved results.",
                "We focused on queries in padvanced > 0% where the same user had issued a query without operators and the same query with operators either before or afterwards.",
                "Although there were few queries with matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with quotes in the initial query.",
                "It may be the case that quoted queries led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead to judged documents receiving higher scores.",

                "Advanced search engine users may be more adept at combining query operators to formulate powerful query statements.",
                "We now discuss the findings from all three subsections and their implications for the design of improved Web search systems. 4 It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google, Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search engine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced. 6.",
                "DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying, result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those that use advanced syntax versus those that do not.",
                "Many of these findings mirror those already found in previous studies with groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19].",
                "There are several ways in which a commercial search engine system might benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise.",
                "This might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it may be the case that <br>expert search</br>ers in some cases prefer different pages than novice searchers.",
                "The user interface to a search engine might be tailored to a users expertise level; perhaps even more advanced features such as term weighting and query expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for novices.",
                "Result presentation might also be customized based on search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different outcomes for different expertise levels.",
                "Additionally, if browsing histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].",
                "The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the designers of search systems.",
                "In part, these searchers may have more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome the shortcomings of search systems [29].",
                "Their interactions can be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to search more effectively.",
                "However, if expert users are going to be used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.",
                "Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose interactions we studied.",
                "Whilst these may be amongst the most active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover large number of subject areas.",
                "However, rather than focusing on where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn from.",
                "Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching style of <br>expert search</br>ers could help them learn more successful post-query interactions.",
                "One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior research, it has been shown that query operators do not significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8], and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without them [27].",
                "It could therefore be argued that the users who do not use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query statements.",
                "However, this seems unlikely given that those who use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.",
                "However, in future work we will expand of definition of advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12]. 7.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have described a log-based study of search behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query navigation, and search success.",
                "Those that use this syntax are active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are more successful in there searching.",
                "These are all traits that we would expect <br>expert search</br>ers to exhibit.",
                "Crude classification of users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do.",
                "As we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions of these users for improved document ranking, page recommendation, or even user training.",
                "Future work will include the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval engines that make use of these information-rich features, and further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between result click and post-query behavior. 8.",
