A set of words with identical trends can be grouped together to reconstruct an event in a completely unsupervised manner. The document frequency of each word across time is treated like a time series, where each element is the document frequency - inverse document frequency (DFIDF) score at one time point. In this paper, we 1) first applied spectral analysis to categorize features for different event characteristics: important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic; 2) modeled aperiodic features with Gaussian density and periodic features with Gaussian mixture densities, and subsequently detected each features burst by the truncated Gaussian approach; 3) proposed an unsupervised greedy event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events. All of the above methods can be applied to time series data in general. We extensively evaluated our methods on the 1-year Reuters News Corpus [3] and showed that they were able to uncover meaningful aperiodic and periodic events.

INTRODUCTION There are more than 4,000 online news sources in the world. Manually monitoring all of them for important events has become difficult or practically impossible. In fact, the topic detection and tracking (TDT) community has for many years been trying to come up with a practical solution to help people monitor news effectively. Unfortunately, the holy grail is still elusive, because the vast majority of TDT solutions proposed for event detection [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] are either too simplistic (based on cosine similarity [5]) or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of parameters [9]. The ineffectiveness of current TDT technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of the many online news alerts services such as the industryleading Google News Alerts [2], which generates more than 50% false alarms [10]. As further proof, portals like Yahoo take a more pragmatic approach by requiring all machine generated news alerts to go through a human operator for confirmation before sending them out to subscribers. Instead of attacking the problem with variations of the same hammer (cosine similarity and TFIDF), a fundamental understanding of the characteristics of news stream data is necessary before any major breakthroughs can be made in TDT. Thus in this paper, we look at news stories and feature trends from the perspective of analyzing a time-series word signal. Previous work like [9] has attempted to reconstruct an event with its representative features. However, in many predictive event detection tasks (i.e., retrospective event detection), there is a vast set of potential features only for a fixed set of observations (i.e., the obvious bursts). Of these features, often only a small number are expected to be useful. In particular, we study the novel problem of analyzing feature trajectories for event detection, borrowing a well-known technique from signal processing: identifying distributional correlations among all features by spectral analysis. To evaluate our method, we subsequently propose an unsupervised event detection algorithm for news streams. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 Easter April (a) aperiodic event 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 Unaudited Ended (b) periodic event Figure 1: Feature correlation (DFIDF:time) between a) Easter and April b) Unaudited and Ended. As an illustrative example, consider the correlation between the words Easter and April from the Reuters Corpus1 . From the plot of their normalized DFIDF in Figure 1(a), we observe the heavy overlap between the two words circa 04/1997, which means they probably both belong to the same event during that time (Easter feast). In this example, the hidden event Easter feast is a typical important aperiodic event over 1-year data. Another example is given by Figure 1(b), where both the words Unaudited and Ended 1 Reuters Corpus is the default dataset for all examples. exhibit similar behaviour over periods of 3 months. These two words actually originated from the same periodic event, net income-loss reports, which are released quarterly by publicly listed companies. Other observations drawn from Figure 1 are: 1) the bursty period of April is much longer than Easter, which suggests that April may exist in other events during the same period; 2) Unaudited has a higher average DFIDF value than Ended, which indicates Unaudited to be more representative for the underlying event. These two examples are but the tip of the iceberg among all word trends and correlations hidden in a news stream like Reuters. If a large number of them can be uncovered, it could significantly aid TDT tasks. In particular, it indicates the significance of mining correlating features for detecting corresponding events. To summarize, we postulate that: 1) An event is described by its representative features. A periodic event has a list of periodic features and an aperiodic event has a list of aperiodic features; 2) Representative features from the same event share similar distributions over time and are highly correlated; 3) An important event has a set of active (largely reported) representative features, whereas an unimportant event has a set of inactive (less-reported) representative features; 4) A feature may be included by several events with overlaps in time frames. Based on these observations, we can either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features. In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner. 1.1 Contributions This paper has three main contributions: • To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events. Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events. Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2. RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10]. Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time. Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event. However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities. On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above. Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information. Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc. Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events. Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event. Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs. Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search. In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3. DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches. We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows. Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once. Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event. Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event. Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative. The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4. IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T. The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator. The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum. From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows. Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 . Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty. Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic. The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 . However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later. Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples. Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values. Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day. For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b). Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas. 0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Christmas(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=365 S=135.68 (b) Christmas(S:frequency) Figure 2: Feature Christmas with relative high Sf and long-term Pf . The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b). Using the domain knowledge that soccer games have more matches every Saturday, which makes it a typical and heavily reported periodic event, we thus consider the value of Sf = 155.13 to be high. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) soccer(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=155.13 (b) soccer(S:frequency) Figure 3: Feature soccer with relative high Sf and short-term Pf . From the DFIDF trajectory for DBS in Figure 4(a), we can immediately deduce DBS to be an infrequent word with a trivial burst on 08/17/1997 corresponding to DBS Land Raﬄes Holdings plans. This is confirmed by the long period of Pf = 365 and low power of Sf = 0.3084 as shown in Figure 4(b). Moreover, since this aperiodic event is only reported in a few news stories over a very short time of few days, we therefore say that its low power value of Sf = 0.3084 is representative of unimportant events. The most confusing example is shown in Figure 5 for the word feature your, which looks very similar to the graph for soccer in Figure 3. At first glance, we may be tempted to group both your and soccer into the same category of HL or LL since both distributions look similar and have the same dominant period of approximately a week. However, further 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) DBS(DFIDF:time) 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=365 S=0.3084 (b) DBS(S:frequency) Figure 4: Feature DBS with relative low Sf and long-term Pf . analysis indicates that the periodicity of your is due to the differences in document counts for weekdays (average 2,919 per day) and weekends3 (average 479 per day). One would have expected the periodicity of a stopword like your to be a day. Moreover, despite our DFIDF normalization, the weekday/weekend imbalance still prevailed; stopwords occur 4 times more frequently on weekends than on weekdays. Thus, the DPS remains the only distinguishing factor between your (Sf = 9.42) and soccer (Sf = 155.13). However, it is very dangerous to simply conclude that a power value of S = 9.42 corresponds to a stopword feature. 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) your(DFIDF:time) 0 5 10 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=9.42 (b) your(S:frequency) Figure 5: Feature your as an example confusing with feature soccer. Before introducing our solution to this problem, lets look at another LL example as shown in Figure 6 for beenb, which is actually a confirmed typo. We therefore classify beenb as a noisy feature that does not contribute to any event. Clearly, the trajectory of your is very different from beenb, which means that the former has to be considered separately. 0 0.001 0.002 0.003 0.004 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) beenb(DFIDF:time) 1.20E-05 1.20E-05 1.20E-05 1.20E-05 1.20E-05 0.003 0.126 0.249 0.373 0.496 P=8 S=1.20E-05 (b) beenb(S:frequency) Figure 6: Feature beenb with relative low Sf and short-term Pf . Stop Words (SW) Feature Set Based on the above analysis, we realize that there must be another feature set between HL and LL that corresponds to the set of stopwords. Features from this set has moderate DPS and low but known dominant period. Since it is hard to distinguish this feature set from HL and LL only based on DPS, we introduce another factor called average DFIDF (DFIDF). As shown in Figure 5, features like your usually have a lower DPS than a HL feature like soccer, but have a much higher DFIDF than another LL noisy feature such as beenb. Since such properties are usually characteristics of stopwords, we group features like your into the newly defined stopword (SW) feature set. Since setting the DPS and DFIDF thresholds for identifying stopwords is more of an art than science, we proposed a heuristic HS algorithm, Algorithm 1. The basic idea is to only use news stories from weekdays to identify stopwords. 3 The weekends here also include public holidays falling on weekdays. The SW set is initially seeded with a small set of 29 popular stopwords utilized by Google search engine.

We then set the boundary between high and low DPS to be the upper bound of the SW sets DPS. An overview of all five feature sets is shown in Figure 7. Figure 7: The 5 feature sets for events. 5. IDENTIFYING BURSTS FOR FEATURES Since only features from HH, HL and LH are meaningful and could potentially be representative to some events, we pruned all other feature classified as LL or SW. In this section, we describe how bursts can be identified from the remaining features. Unlike Kleinbergs burst identification algorithm [12], we can identify both significant and trivial bursts without the need to set any parameters. 5.1 Detecting Aperiodic Features Bursts For each feature in HH and HL, we truncate its trajectory by keeping only the bursty period, which is modeled with a Gaussian distribution. For example, Figure 8 shows the word feature Iraq with a burst circa 09/06/1996 being modeled as a Gaussian. Its bursty period is defined by [μf − σf , μf + σf ] as shown in Figure 8(b). 5.2 Detecting Periodic Features Bursts Since we have computed the DP for a periodic feature f, we can easily model its periodic feature trajectory yf using 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/96 12/8/96 3/28/97 7/16/97 (a) original DFIDF:time 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/96 12/8/96 3/28/97 7/16/97 burst= [μ-σ, μ+σ] (b) identifying burst Figure 8: Modeling Iraqs time series as a truncated Gaussian with μ = 09/06/1996 and σ = 6.26. a mixture of K = T/Pf Gaussians: f(yf = yf (t)|θf ) = K k=1 αk 1 2πσ2 k e − 1 2σ2 k (yf (t)−µk)2 , where the parameter set θf = {αk, μk, σk}K k=1 comprises: • αk is the probability of assigning yf into the kth Gaussian. αk > 0, ∀k ∈ [1, K] and K k=1 αk = 1; • μk/σk is mean/standard deviation of the kth Gaussian. The well known Expectation Maximization (EM) [8] algorithm is used to compute the mixing proportions αk, as well as the individual Gaussian density parameters μk and σK . Each Gaussian represents one periodic event, and is modeled similarly as mentioned in Section 5.1. 6. EVENTS FROM FEATURES After identifying and modeling bursts for all features, the next task is to paint a picture of the event with a potential set of representative features. 6.1 Feature Correlation If two features fi and fj are representative of the same event, they must satisfy the following necessary conditions: 1. fi and fj are identically distributed: yfi ∼ yfj . 2. fi and fj have a high document overlap. Measuring Feature Distribution Similarity We measure the similarity between two features fi and fj using discrete KL-divergence defined as follows. Definition 6. (feature similarity) KL(fi, fj ) is given by max(KL(fi|fj ), KL(fj |fi)), where KL(fi|fj ) = T t=1 f(yfi (t)|θfi )log f(yfi (t)|θfi ) f(yfj (t)|θfj ) . (1) Since KL-divergence is not symmetric, we define the similarity between between fi and fj as the maximum of KL(fi|fj ) and KL(fj |fi). Further, the similarity between two aperiodic features can be computed using a closed form of the KL-divergence [16]. The same discrete KL-divergence formula of Eq. 1 is employed to compute the similarity between two periodic features, Next, we define the overal similarity among a set of features R using the maximum inter-feature KL-Divergence value as follows. Definition 7. (sets similarity)KL(R) = max ∀fi,fj ∈R KL(fi, fj ). Document Overlap Let Mi be the set of all documents containing feature fi. Given two features fi and fj , the overlapping document set containing both features is Mi ∩ Mj . Intuitively, the higher the |Mi ∩ Mj |, the more likelty that fi and fj will be highly correlated. We define the degree of document overlap between two features fi and fj as follows. Definition 8. (Feature DF Overlap) d(fi, fj ) = |Mi∩Mj| min(|Mi|,|Mj|) . Accordingly, the DF Overlap among a set of features R is also defined. Definition 9. (Set DF Overlap) d(R) = min ∀fi,fj ∈R d(fi, fj). 6.2 Unsupervised Greedy Event Detection We use features from HH to detect important aperiodic events, features from LH to detect less-reported/unimportant aperiodic events, and features from HL to detect periodic events. All of them share the same algorithm. Given bursty feature fi ∈ HH, the goal is to find highly correlated features from HH. The set of features similar to fi can then collectively describe an event. Specifically, we need to find a subset Ri of HH that minimizes the following cost function: C(Ri) = KL(Ri) d(Ri) fj ∈Ri Sfj , Ri ⊂ HH. (2) The underlying event e (associated with the burst of fi) can be represented by Ri as y(e) = fj ∈Ri Sfj fu∈Ri Sfu yfj . (3) The burst analysis for event e is exactly the same as the feature trajectory. The cost in Eq. 2 can be minimized using our unsupervised greedy UG event detection algorithm, which is described in Algorithm 2. The UG algorithm allows a feature Algorithm 2 Unsupervised Greedy event detection (UG). Input: HH, document index for each feature. 1: Sort and select features in descending DPS order: Sf1 ≥ Sf2 ≥ . . . ≥ Sf|HH| . 2: k = 0. 3: for fi ∈ HH do 4: k = k + 1. 5: Init: Ri ← fi, C(Ri) = 1/Sfi and HH = HH − fi. 6: while HH not empty do 7: m = arg min m C(Ri ∪ fm). 8: if C(Ri ∪ fm) < C(Ri) then 9: Ri ← fm and HH = HH − fm. 10: else 11: break while. 12: end if 13: end while 14: Output ek as Eq. 3. 15: end for to be contained in multiple events so that we can detect several events happening at the same time. Furthermore, trivial events only containing year/month features (i.e., an event only containing 1 feature Aug could be identified over a 1year news stream) could be removed, although such events will have inherent high cost and should already be ranked very low. Note that our UG algorithm only requires one data-dependant parameter, the boundary between high and low power spectrum, to be set once, and this parameter can be easily estimated using the HS algorithm (Algorithm 1). 7. EXPERIMENTS In this section, we study the performances of our feature categorizing method and event detection algorithm. We first introduce the dataset and experimental setup, then we subjectively evaluate the categorization of features for HH, HL, LH, LL and SW. Finally, we study the (a)periodic event detection problem with Algorithm 2. 7.1 Dataset and Experimental Setup The Reuters Corpus contains 806,791 English news stories from 08/20/1996 to 08/19/1997 at a day resolution. Version 2 of the open source Lucene software [1] was used to tokenize the news text content and generate the document-word vector. In order to preserve the time-sensitive past/present/future tenses of verbs and the differences between lower case nouns and upper case named entities, no stemming was done. Since dynamic stopword removal is one of the functionalities of our method, no stopword was removed. We did remove nonEnglish characters, however, after which the number of word features amounts to 423,433. All experiments were implemented in Java and conducted on a 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 PC running Windows 2003 Server with 1 GB of memory. 7.2 Categorizing Features We downloaded 34 well-known stopwords utilized by the Google search engine as our seed training features, which includes a, about, an, are, as, at, be, by, de, for, from, how, in, is, it, of, on, or, that, the, this, to, was, what, when, where, who, will, with, la, com, und, en and www. We excluded the last five stopwords as they are uncommon in news stories. By only analyzing news stories over 259 weekdays, we computed the upper bound of the power spectrum for stopwords at 11.18 and corresponding DFIDF ranges from 0.1182 to 0.3691. Any feature f satisfying Sf <= 11.18 and 0.1182 <= DFIDFf <= 0.3691 over weekdays will be considered a stopword. In this manner, 470 stopwords were found and removed as visualized in Figure 9. Some detected stopwords are A (P = 65, S = 3.36, DFIDF = 0.3103), At (P = 259, S = 1.86, DFIDF = 0.1551), GMT (P = 130, S = 6.16, DFIDF = 0.1628) and much (P = 22, S = 0.80, DFIDF = 0.1865). After the removal of these stopwords, the distribution of weekday and weekend news are more or less matched, and in the ensuing experiments, we shall make use of the full corpus (weekdays and weekends). The upper bound power spectrum value of 11.18 for stopwords training was selected as the boundary between the high power and low power spectrum. The boundary between high and low periodicity was set to 365/2 = 183. All 422,963 (423433 − 470) word features were categorized into 4 feature sets: HH (69 features), HL (1,087 features), LH (83,471 features), and LL (338,806 features) as shown in Figure 10. In Figure 10, each gray level denotes the relative density of features in a square region, measured by log10(1 + Dk), where Dk is the number of features within the k-th square region. From the figure, we can make the 0 2 4 6 8 11.18 12879.82 1 65 100 130 259 S(f) P(f) LH HH LL HL Figure 9: Distribution of SW (stopwords) in the HH, HL, LH, and LL regions. 0 5 11.18 50 100 200 300 400 500 1000 12879.82 1 2 4 6 8 20 50 100 183 364 365 S(f) P(f) 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 LH HH LL HL Figure 10: Distribution of categorized features over the four quadrants (shading in log scale). following observations: 1. Most features have low S and are easily distinguishable from those features having a much higher S, which allows us to detect important (a)periodic events from trivial events by selecting features with high S. 2. Features in the HH and LH quadrants are aperiodic, which are nicely separated (big horizontal gap) from the periodic features. This allows reliably detecting aperiodic events and periodic events independently. 3. The (vertical) boundary between high and low power spectrum is not as clearcut and the exact value will be application specific. By checking the scatter distribution of features from SW on HH, HL, LH, and LL as shown in Figure 9, we found that 87.02%(409/470) of the detected stopwords originated from LL. The LL classification and high DFIDF scores of stopwords agree with the generally accepted notion that stopwords are equally frequent over all time. Therefore, setting the boundary between high and low power spectrum using the upper bound Sf of SW is a reasonable heuristic. 7.3 Detecting Aperiodic Events We shall evaluate our two hypotheses, 1)important aperiodic events can be defined by a set of HH features, and 2)less reported aperiodic events can be defined by a set of LH features. Since no benchmark news streams exist for event detection (TDT datasets are not proper streams), we evaluate the quality of the automatically detected events by comparing them to manually-confirmed events by searching through the corpus. Among the 69 HH features, we detected 17 important aperiodic events as shown in Table 1 (e1 − e17). Note that the entire identification took less than 1 second, after removing events containing only the month feature. Among the 17 events, other than the overlaps between e3 and e4 (both describes the same hostage event), e11 and e16 (both about company reports), the 14 identified events are extremely accurate and correspond very well to the major events of the period. For example, the defeat of Bob Dole, election of Tony Blair, Missile attack on Iraq, etc. Recall that selecting the features for one event should minimize the cost in Eq. 2 such that 1) the number of features span different events, and 2) not all features relevant to an event will be selected, e.g., the feature Clinton is representative to e12 but since Clinton relates to many other events, its time domain signal is far different from those of other representative features like Dole and Bob. The number of documents of a detected event is roughly estimated by the number of indexed documents containing the representative features. We can see that all 17 important aperiodic events are popularly reported events. After 742 minutes of computation time, we detected 23, 525 less reported aperiodic events from 83,471 LH features. Table 1 lists the top 5 detected aperiodic events (e18 − e22) with respect to the cost. We found that these 5 events are actually very trivial events with only a few news reports, and are usually subsumed by some larger topics. For example, e22 is one of the rescue events in an airplane hijack topic. One advantage of our UG Algorithm for discovering less-reported aperiodic events is that we are able to precisely detect the true event period. 7.4 Detecting Periodic Events Among the 1,087 HL features, 330 important periodic events were detected within 10 minutes of computing time. Table 1 lists the top 5 detected periodic events with respect to the cost (e23 − e27). All of the detected periodic events are indeed valid, and correspond to real life periodic events. The GMM model is able to detect and estimate the bursty period nicely although it cannot distinguish the slight difference between every Monday-Friday and all weekdays as shown in e23. We also notice that e26 is actually a subset of e27 (soccer game), which is acceptable since the Sheffield league results are announced independently every weekend. 8. CONCLUSIONS This paper took a whole new perspective of analyzing feature trajectories as time domain signals. By considering the word document frequencies in both time and frequency domains, we were able to derive many new characteristics about news streams that were previously unknown, e.g., the different distributions of stopwords during weekdays and weekends. For the first time in the area of TDT, we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic events. The key idea of our work lies in the observations that (a)periodic events have (a)periodic representative features and (un)important events have (in)active representative features, differentiated by their power spectrums and time periods. To address the real event detection problem, a simple and effective mixture density-based approach was used to identify feature bursts and their associated bursty periods. We also designed an unsupervised greedy algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events, which was successful in detecting real events as shown in the evaluation on a real news stream. Although we have not made any benchmark comparison against another approach, simply because there is no previous work in the addressed problem. Future work includes evaluating the recall of detected events for a labeled news stream, and comparing our model against the closest equivalent methods, which currently are limited to the methods of Kleinberg [12] (which can only detect certain type of bursty events depending on parameter settings), Fung et al. [9], and Swan and Allan [18]. Nevertheless, we believe our simple and effective method will be useful for all TDT practitioners, and will be especially useful for the initial exploratory analysis of news streams. 9.

Un conjunto de palabras con tendencias idénticas se puede agrupar para reconstruir un evento de una manera completamente sin supervisión. La frecuencia del documento de cada palabra a lo largo del tiempo se trata como una serie de tiempo, donde cada elemento es la puntuación de frecuencia de documento de documento (DFIDF) en un momento. En este artículo, 1) primero aplicamos análisis espectral para clasificar las características para diferentes características del evento: importantes y menos informados, periódicos y aperiódicos;2) características aperiódicas modeladas con densidad gaussiana y características periódicas con densidades de mezcla gaussiana, y posteriormente detectaron cada características estalladas por el enfoque gaussiano truncado;3) propuso un algoritmo de detección de eventos codiciosos no supervisado para detectar eventos aperiódicos y periódicos. Todos los métodos anteriores se pueden aplicar a los datos de series temporales en general. Evaluamos ampliamente nuestros métodos en el Corpus Reuters News de 1 año [3] y demostramos que pudieron descubrir eventos aperiódicos y periódicos significativos. Categorías y descriptores de temas: H.3.3 [Almacenamiento y recuperación de información]: Búsqueda de información y recuperación Términos generales: algoritmos, experimentación.1. Introducción Hay más de 4,000 fuentes de noticias en línea en el mundo. Monitorear manualmente a todos para eventos importantes se ha vuelto difícil o prácticamente imposible. De hecho, la comunidad de detección y seguimiento de temas (TDT) ha estado tratando de encontrar durante muchos años con una solución práctica para ayudar a las personas a monitorear las noticias de manera efectiva. Desafortunadamente, el Santo Grial sigue siendo difícil, porque la gran mayoría de las soluciones TDT propuestas para la detección de eventos [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] son demasiado simplistas (basadas en la similitud de coseno [5])o poco práctico debido a la necesidad de sintonizar una gran cantidad de parámetros [9]. La ineficacia de las tecnologías TDT actuales se puede ilustrar fácilmente suscribiéndose a cualquiera de los muchos servicios de alertas de noticias en línea, como las alertas de Google News [2] de liderazgo de la industria, que genera más del 50% de falsas alarmas [10]. Como pruebas adicionales, los portales como Yahoo adoptan un enfoque más pragmático al requerir que todas las alertas de noticias generadas por la máquina pasen por un operador humano para confirmar antes de enviarlas a los suscriptores. En lugar de atacar el problema con las variaciones del mismo martillo (similitud de coseno y TFIDF), es necesaria una comprensión fundamental de las características de los datos del flujo de noticias antes de que se puedan hacer avances importantes en TDT. Por lo tanto, en este documento, observamos noticias de noticias y presentamos tendencias desde la perspectiva de analizar una señal de palabra de series de tiempo. Trabajo anterior como [9] ha intentado reconstruir un evento con sus características representativas. Sin embargo, en muchas tareas de detección de eventos predictivos (es decir, detección de eventos retrospectivos), existe un vasto conjunto de características potenciales solo para un conjunto fijo de observaciones (es decir, las ráfagas obvias). De estas características, a menudo se espera que solo un pequeño número sea útil. En particular, estudiamos el novedoso problema de analizar las trayectorias de características para la detección de eventos, tomando prestada una técnica bien conocida del procesamiento de señales: identificación de correlaciones de distribución entre todas las características mediante análisis espectral. Para evaluar nuestro método, posteriormente proponemos un algoritmo de detección de eventos no supervisado para las transmisiones de noticias.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 28/03/1997 7/16/1997 Pascua de abril (a) Evento aperiódico 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 16/06/1997 Evento periódico no auditado Figura 1: Correlación de características (DFIDF: Tiempo) Entre a) Pascua y abril b) no auditada y termina. Como ejemplo ilustrativo, considere la correlación entre las palabras Pascua y abril del Corpus Reuters1. A partir de la gráfica de su DFIDF normalizado en la Figura 1 (a), observamos la fuerte superposición entre las dos palabras alrededor del 04/1997, lo que significa que probablemente ambos pertenecen al mismo evento durante ese tiempo (fiesta de Pascua). En este ejemplo, el evento oculto Feast de Pascua es un evento aperiódico importante típico durante datos de 1 año. Otro ejemplo está dado por la Figura 1 (b), donde las palabras no auditadas y terminadas 1 Reuter Corpus es el conjunto de datos predeterminado para todos los ejemplos.exhibir un comportamiento similar durante períodos de 3 meses. Estas dos palabras en realidad se originaron en el mismo evento periódico, informes netos de pérdida de ingresos, que son publicadas trimestralmente por empresas que cotizan en bolsa. Otras observaciones extraídas de la Figura 1 son: 1) el período de abril es mucho más largo que la Pascua, lo que sugiere que April puede existir en otros eventos durante el mismo período;2) Unaudited tiene un valor de DFIDF promedio más alto que el final, lo que indica que no es auditado como más representativo para el evento subyacente. Estos dos ejemplos no son más que la punta del iceberg entre todas las tendencias y correlaciones de palabras ocultas en un flujo de noticias como Reuters. Si se puede descubrir un gran número de ellos, podría ayudar significativamente a las tareas de TDT. En particular, indica la importancia de las características de correlacionamiento de la minería para detectar los eventos correspondientes. Para resumir, postulamos que: 1) sus características representativas describen un evento. Un evento periódico tiene una lista de características periódicas y un evento aperiódico tiene una lista de características aperiódicas;2) las características representativas del mismo evento comparten distribuciones similares a lo largo del tiempo y están altamente correlacionadas;3) Un evento importante tiene un conjunto de características representativas activas (en gran parte informadas), mientras que un evento sin importancia tiene un conjunto de características representativas inactivas (menos informadas);4) Una característica puede ser incluida por varios eventos con superposiciones en los marcos de tiempo. Según estas observaciones, podemos extraer características representativas dado un evento o detectar un evento de una lista de características altamente correlacionadas. En este artículo, nos centramos en este último, es decir, cómo se pueden descubrir las características correlacionadas para formar un evento de manera no supervisada.1.1 Contribuciones Este documento tiene tres contribuciones principales: • Hasta donde sabemos, nuestro enfoque es el primero en clasificar las características de las palabras para eventos heterogéneos. Específicamente, cada característica de palabras se clasifica en uno de los siguientes cinco tipos de características en función de su resistencia y periodicidad del espectro de potencia: 1) HH (alta potencia y periodicidad alta/larga): eventos aperiódicos importantes, 2) HL (alta potencia y baja periodicidad): eventos periódicos importantes, 3) LH (baja potencia y alta periodicidad): eventos aperiódicos sin importancia, 4) ll (baja potencia y baja periodicidad): no eventos y 5) SW (palabras de parada), un subconjunto de mayor potencia y periodicidadde LL que comprende palabras de parada, que no contienen información.• Proponemos un enfoque basado en densidad de mezcla simple y efectivo para modelar y detectar explosiones de características.• Se nos ocurrió un algoritmo de detección de eventos no supervisado para detectar eventos aperiódicos y periódicos. Nuestro algoritmo ha sido evaluado en un flujo de noticias real para mostrar su efectividad.2. Trabajo relacionado Este trabajo está motivado en gran medida por una familia más amplia de problemas conocidos colectivamente como detección y seguimiento de temas (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10]. Además, la mayoría de las investigaciones de TDT hasta ahora se han preocupado por agrupar/clasificar documentos en tipos de temas, identificar oraciones novedosas [6] para nuevos eventos, etc., sin tener en cuenta la analización de la trayectoria de la palabra con respecto al tiempo. Swan y Allan [18] intentaron primero usar términos de concentración para construir un evento. Sin embargo, solo consideraron entidades nombradas y pares de frases nomnables, sin considerar sus periódicos. Por el contrario, nuestro artículo considera todo lo anterior. Recientemente, ha habido un interés significativo en modelar un evento en las corrientes de texto como una explosión de actividades al incorporar información temporal. El trabajo seminal de Kleinbergs describió cómo se pueden extraer las características de Burny de las corrientes de texto utilizando un modelo de autómata infinito [12], que inspiró una serie completa de aplicaciones como la identificación de Kumars de comunidades ruidosas de gráficos de weblog [13], resumen de MEI de temas evolutivos en texto en textoStreams [15], Hes se agrupa de flujos de texto utilizando características de ráfaga [11], etc. Sin embargo, ninguno de los trabajos existentes identificó específicamente las características para los eventos, excepto Fung et al.[9], que agruparon características tetonas para identificar varios eventos explosivos. Nuestro trabajo difiere de [9] de varias maneras: 1) Analizamos cada característica, no solo las características explosivas;2) Clasificamos características a lo largo de dos dimensiones categóricas (periodicidad y potencia), produciendo completamente cinco tipos de características principales;3) No restringimos que cada característica pertenezca exclusivamente a un solo evento. Las técnicas de análisis espectral han sido utilizadas previamente por Vlachos et al.[19] para identificar periodicidades y explosiones de los registros de consultas. Su enfoque estaba en detectar múltiples periodicidades del gráfico de espectro de potencia, que luego se usaron para indexar palabras para la búsqueda de consulta por hurta. En este documento, utilizamos el análisis espectral para clasificar las características de las palabras a lo largo de dos dimensiones, a saber, la periodicidad y el espectro de potencia, con el objetivo final de identificar eventos periódicos y aperiódicos de ruptura.3. Representación de datos Sea t la duración/período (en días) de un flujo de noticias, y F representa el espacio completo de características de la palabra en el modelo de espacio vectorial estático (VSM) clásico.3.1 Clasificación de periodicidad del evento Dentro de T, puede existir ciertos eventos que ocurren solo una vez, por ejemplo, Tony Blair elegido como Primer Ministro del Reino Unido, y otros eventos recurrentes de varias periodicidades, por ejemplo, coincidencias semanales de fútbol. Por lo tanto, clasificamos todos los eventos en dos tipos: aperiódico y periódico, definido de la siguiente manera. Definición 1. (Evento aperiódico) Un evento es aperiódico dentro de T si solo sucede una vez. Definición 2. (evento periódico) Si los eventos de un determinado género de eventos ocurren regularmente con una periodicidad fija P ≤ t/2, decimos que este género de eventos en particular es periódico, con cada evento miembro calificado como un evento periódico. Tenga en cuenta que la definición de aperiódico es relativa, es decir, es cierto solo para una T determinada, y puede ser inválida para cualquier otra T> T. Por ejemplo, el evento de Navidad es aperiódico para T ≤ 365 pero periódico para T ≥ 730. 3.2 Características representativas intuitivamente, un evento puede describirse de manera muy concisa por algunas características de palabras discriminativas y representativas y viceversa, por ejemplo, huracán, barrido y huelga podrían ser características representativas de un evento de género de huracanes. Del mismo modo, se podría usar un conjunto de características fuertemente correlacionadas para reconstruir una descripción del evento, suponiendo que las características fuertemente correlacionadas son representativas. El vector de representación de una característica de Word se define de la siguiente manera: Definición 3. (Trayectoria de características) La trayectoria de una palabra de palabra F se puede escribir como la secuencia yf = [yf (1), yf (2) ,..., yf (t)], donde cada elemento yf (t) es una medida de la característica f en el tiempo t, que podría definirse utilizando el puntaje DFIDF normalizado2 yf (t) = dff (t) n (t) × log (nDFF), donde DFF (t) es el número de documentos (DF locales) que contienen característica F en el día t, DFF es el número total de documentos (DF global) que contiene la característica F Over t, N (t) es el número de documentospara el día t, y n es el número total de documentos sobre T. 4. Identificación de características para eventos en esta sección, mostramos cómo se pueden extraer características representativas para eventos (no) importantes o (a) periódicos.4.1 Análisis espectral para el período dominante Dada una característica F, descomponemos su trayectoria de características yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (t)] en la secuencia de números complejos t [x1 ,..., Xt] a través de la transformación discreta de Fourier (DFT): xk = t t = 1 yf (t) e- 2πi t (k - 1) t, k = 1, 2 ,..., T. DFT puede representar la serie temporal original como una combinación lineal de sinusoides complejos, que se ilustra mediante la transformación de Fourier discreta inversa (idft): yf (t) = 1 t t k = 1 xke 2πi t (k - 1) t, t = 1, 2 ,..., T, donde el coeficiente de Fourier XK denota la amplitud del sinusoide con la frecuencia k/t. La trayectoria original se puede reconstruir solo con las frecuencias dominantes, que se pueden determinar a partir del espectro de potencia utilizando el estimador de periodograma popular. El periodograma es una secuencia de la magnitud al cuadrado de los coeficientes de Fourier, xk 2, k = 1, 2 ,..., T/2, que indica la potencia de señal a la frecuencia k/t en el espectro. Desde el espectro de potencia, el período dominante se elige como el inverso de la frecuencia con el espectro de potencia más alto, como sigue. Definición 4. (Período dominante) El período dominante (DP) de una característica dada F es pf = t/ arg max k xk 2. En consecuencia, tenemos la definición 5. (espectro de potencia dominante) El espectro de potencia dominante (DPS) de una característica dada F es SF = XK 2, con XK 2 ≥ XJ 2, ∀j = K.4.2 Características de categorización El DPS de una trayectoria de características es un fuerte indicador de su actividad a la frecuencia especificada;Cuanto mayor sea el DPS, más probable es que la característica sea estallada. Combinando DP con DP, por lo tanto, clasificamos todas las características en cuatro tipos: 2 Normalizamos yf (t) como yf (t) = yf (t)/ t i = 1 yf (i) para que pueda interpretarse como una probabilidad.• HH: alto SF, aperiódico o periódico a largo plazo (pf> t/2);• HL: alto SF, periódico a corto plazo (PF ≤ t/2);• LH: bajo SF, aperiódico o periódico a largo plazo;• LL: bajo SF, periódico a corto plazo. El límite entre el periódico a largo y corto plazo se establece en T/2. Sin embargo, distinguir entre un DPS alto y bajo no es sencillo, lo que se abordará más tarde. Propiedades de diferentes conjuntos de características para comprender mejor las propiedades de HH, HL, LH y LL, seleccionamos cuatro características, Navidad, Fútbol, DBS y sus ejemplos ilustrativos. Dado que el límite entre el espectro de potencia alta y baja no está claro, estos ejemplos elegidos tienen un amplio rango relativo de valores de espectro de potencia. La Figura 2 (a) muestra la trayectoria DFIDF para Navidad con una explosión distinta alrededor del día de Navidad. Para el conjunto de datos de Reuters de 1 año, la Navidad se clasifica como un evento aperiódico típico con PF = 365 y SF = 135.68, como se muestra en la Figura 2 (b). Claramente, el valor de SF = 135.68 es razonable para un evento rural bien conocido como la Navidad.0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 28/03/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Navidad (DFIDF: Tiempo) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P = 365 S = 135.68 (B (B (B) Navidad (S: Frecuencia) Figura 2: Característica de Navidad con relativo SF alto y PF a largo plazo. La trayectoria DFIDF para el fútbol se muestra en la Figura 3 (a), de la cual podemos observar que hay una explosión regular cada 7 días, que nuevamente se verifica por su valor calculado de PF = 7, como se muestra en la Figura 3 (b). Utilizando el conocimiento del dominio de que los juegos de fútbol tienen más partidos cada sábado, lo que lo convierte en un evento periódico típico y muy informado, consideramos que el valor de SF = 155.13 es alto.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 2/8/1996 28/03/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Soccer (DFIDF: Tiempo) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P = 7 S = 155.13 (b) Fútbol (S: Frecuencia) Figura 3: Funcionar fútbol con SF relativo alto y PF a corto plazo. De la trayectoria DFIDF para DBS en la Figura 4 (a), podemos deducir inmediatamente que los DBS son una palabra infrecuente con una explosión trivial el 17/08/1997 correspondiente a los planes de propiedades de tierra de DBS. Esto se confirma por el largo período de PF = 365 y baja potencia de SF = 0.3084 como se muestra en la Figura 4 (b). Además, dado que este evento aperiódico solo se informa en algunas noticias en un tiempo muy corto de pocos días, decimos que su bajo valor de potencia de SF = 0.3084 es representativo de eventos sin importancia. El ejemplo más confuso se muestra en la Figura 5 para la característica de la palabra, que se ve muy similar al gráfico para el fútbol en la Figura 3. A primera vista, podemos estar tentados a agrupar su y fútbol en la misma categoría de HL o LL, ya que ambas distribuciones se ven similares y tienen el mismo período dominante de aproximadamente una semana. Sin embargo, más 0 0.005 0.1 0.15 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 28/03/1997 7/16/1997 (a) DBS (DFIDF: Tiempo) 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P = 365 S= 0.3084 (b) DBS (S: Frecuencia) Figura 4: DBS con baja SF relativa y PF a largo plazo.El análisis indica que la periodicidad de su se debe a las diferencias en los recuentos de documentos para los días de semana (promedio de 2,919 por día) y fines de semana 3 (promedio 479 por día). Uno hubiera esperado que la periodicidad de una palabra de parada sea un día. Además, a pesar de nuestra normalización de DFIDF, el desequilibrio de los días de semana/fin de semana aún prevaleció;Las palabras de parada ocurren 4 veces más frecuentemente los fines de semana que en los días de semana. Por lo tanto, el DPS sigue siendo el único factor distintivo entre su (SF = 9.42) y el fútbol (SF = 155.13). Sin embargo, es muy peligroso concluir simplemente que un valor de potencia de S = 9.42 corresponde a una función de palabra de parada.0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 8/20/1996 2/8/1996 28/03/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Su (DFIDF: Tiempo) 0 5 10 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P = 7 S = 9.42 (B (B (B) Su (S: Frecuencia) Figura 5: presente su como ejemplo confuso con el fútbol de funciones. Antes de introducir nuestra solución a este problema, veamos otro ejemplo de LL como se muestra en la Figura 6 para BeenB, que en realidad es un error tipográfico confirmado. Por lo tanto, clasificamos a BeRB como una característica ruidosa que no contribuye a ningún evento. Claramente, la trayectoria de su tuya es muy diferente de BeenB, lo que significa que el primero debe considerarse por separado.0 0.001 0.002 0.003 0.004 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 28/03/1997 7/16/1997 (a) BeenB (DFIDF: Tiempo) 1.20E-05 1.20E-05 1.20E-05 1.20E-051.20E-05 0.003 0.126 0.249 0.373 0.496 P = 8 S = 1.20E-05 (b) Beinb (S: Frecuencia) Figura 6: Característica BEVB con baja SF relativa y PF a corto plazo. Detener las palabras (SW) Conjunto de características Basado en el análisis anterior, nos damos cuenta de que debe haber otra característica establecida entre HL y LL que corresponde al conjunto de palabras de parada. Las características de este conjunto tienen DPS moderado y un período dominante bajo pero conocido. Dado que es difícil distinguir este conjunto de características de HL y LL solo en función de DPS, introducimos otro factor llamado DFIDF promedio (DFIDF). Como se muestra en la Figura 5, características como su generalmente tienen un DPS más bajo que una característica HL como el fútbol, pero tienen un DFIDF mucho más alto que otra característica ruidosa de LL como BeenB. Dado que tales propiedades suelen ser características de las palabras de parada, agrupamos características como usted en el conjunto de características de la palabra de parada recientemente definida (SW). Dado que establecer los umbrales DPS y DFIDF para identificar las palabras de parada es más un arte que la ciencia, propusimos un algoritmo HS heurístico, algoritmo 1. La idea básica es usar solo noticias desde los días de semana para identificar las palabras de parada.3 Los fines de semana aquí también incluyen días festivos que caen entre semana. El conjunto SW se sembra inicialmente con un pequeño conjunto de 29 palabras de parada populares utilizadas por Google Search Engine. Algoritmo 1 Detección de palabras de parada heurística (HS): set de semillas SW, trayectorias de lunes a viernes de todas las palabras 1: desde el conjunto de semillas SW, calcule el DPS máximo como UDPS, DFIDF máximo como UDFIDF y mínimo de DFIDF como DFIDF.2: para fi ∈ F do 3: Calcule DFT para FI.4: Si SFI ≤ UDPS y Dfidffi ∈ [LDFIDF, UDFIDF] Entonces 5: Fi → SW 6: F = F - Fi 7: Fin si 8: Fin para la descripción general de la categorización de características Después de que se genere el conjunto SW, todas las palabras de parada se eliminanDesde F. Luego establecemos el límite entre los DP altos y bajos para que sea el límite superior de los SW establece DPS. Una descripción general de los cinco conjuntos de características se muestra en la Figura 7. Figura 7: Los 5 conjuntos de características para eventos.5. Identificar explosiones para características ya que solo las características de HH, HL y LH son significativas y podrían ser representativas de algunos eventos, podamos todas las demás características clasificadas como LL o SW. En esta sección, describimos cómo se pueden identificar las ráfagas de las características restantes. A diferencia del algoritmo de identificación de ráfaga de Kleinbergs [12], podemos identificar explosiones significativas y triviales sin la necesidad de establecer ningún parámetro.5.1 Detección de ráfagas de características aperiódicas para cada característica en HH y HL, truncamos su trayectoria manteniendo solo el período estallado, que se modela con una distribución gaussiana. Por ejemplo, la Figura 8 muestra la palabra característica Iraq con una explosión alrededor del 06/09/1996 que se modela como gaussiana. Su período explosivo se define por [μF - σf, μF + σf] como se muestra en la Figura 8 (b).5.2 Detección de ráfagas de características periódicas ya que hemos calculado el DP para una característica periódica F, podemos modelar fácilmente su trayectoria de características periódicas YF usando 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/96 12/8/96 28/03/97 7/16/97 (a) DFIDF original: Tiempo 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/96 12/8/96 28/03/97 7/16/97 Burst = [μ-σ, μ+σ] (b) Identificación de estallidoFigura 8: Modelado de series temporales de Iraq como gaussianos truncados con μ = 06/06/1996 y σ = 6.26.Una mezcla de k = t/pf gaussians: f (yf = yf (t) | θf) = k k = 1 αk 1 2πσ2 k e - 1 2σ2 k (yf (t) −µk) 2, donde el parámetro establecido θf ={αk, μk, σk} k k = 1 comprende: • αk es la probabilidad de asignar YF al kth gaussian.αk> 0, ∀k ∈ [1, k] y k k = 1 αk = 1;• μK/σk es la desviación media/estándar del kth gaussian. El algoritmo de maximización de expectativa bien conocido (EM) [8] se usa para calcular las proporciones de mezcla αK, así como los parámetros de densidad gaussianos individuales μK y σk. Cada gaussiano representa un evento periódico y se modela de manera similar como se menciona en la Sección 5.1.6. Eventos de las características después de identificar y modelar explosiones para todas las características, la siguiente tarea es pintar una imagen del evento con un posible conjunto de características representativas.6.1 Correlación de características Si dos características FI y FJ son representativas del mismo evento, deben satisfacer las siguientes condiciones necesarias: 1. FI y FJ se distribuyen de manera idéntica: yfi ∼ yfj.2. FI y FJ tienen una superposición de documentos altos. Medición de la similitud de distribución de características Medimos la similitud entre dos características FI y FJ utilizando divergencia KL discreta definida de la siguiente manera. Definición 6. (Similitud de características) KL (FI, FJ) viene dada por max (kl (fi | fj), kl (fj | fi)), donde kl (fi | fj) = t t = 1 f (yfi (t (t) | θfi) log f (yfi (t) | θfi) f (yfj (t) | θfj).(1) Dado que la divergencia KL no es simétrica, definimos la similitud entre FI y FJ como el máximo de KL (FI | FJ) y KL (FJ | Fi). Además, la similitud entre dos características aperiódicas se puede calcular utilizando una forma cerrada de la divergencia KL [16]. La misma fórmula discreta de divergencia KL de la ecuación.1 se emplea para calcular la similitud entre dos características periódicas, a continuación, definimos la similitud excesiva entre un conjunto de características R utilizando el valor máximo de divergencia KL interfreaturas de la siguiente manera. Definición 7. (establece similitud) kl (r) = max ∀fi, fj ∈R kl (fi, fj). Documento de superposición Deja que MI sea el conjunto de todos los documentos que contienen funciones FI. Dadas dos características FI y FJ, el conjunto de documentos superpuestos que contiene ambas características es MI ∩ MJ. Intuitivamente, cuanto más alto sea el | mi ∩ mj |, más probable que Fi y FJ estarán altamente correlacionados. Definimos el grado de superposición de documentos entre dos características FI y FJ de la siguiente manera. Definición 8. (característica df superplaz) d (fi, fj) = | mi∩mj |min (| mi |, | mj |). En consecuencia, la superposición de DF entre un conjunto de características R también se define. Definición 9. (Establecer DF superposición) d (r) = min ∀fi, fj ∈R d (fi, fj).6.2 Detección de eventos codiciosa no supervisada Utilizamos características de HH para detectar eventos aperiódicos importantes, características de LH para detectar eventos aperiódicos menos informados/sin importancia y características de HL para detectar eventos periódicos. Todos comparten el mismo algoritmo. Dada la característica de ráfaga fi ∈ HH, el objetivo es encontrar características altamente correlacionadas de HH. El conjunto de características similares a FI puede describir colectivamente un evento. Específicamente, necesitamos encontrar un subconjunto RI de HH que minimice la siguiente función de costo: c (ri) = kl (ri) d (ri) fj ∈Ri sfj, ri ⊂ hh.(2) El evento subyacente E (asociado con la explosión de Fi) puede representarse por RI como y (e) = fj ∈Ri sfj fu∈Ri sfu yfj.(3) El análisis de ráfaga para el evento E es exactamente el mismo que la trayectoria de la función. El costo en la ecuación.2 se puede minimizar utilizando nuestro algoritmo de detección de eventos UG codicioso no supervisado, que se describe en el Algoritmo 2. El algoritmo UG permite un algoritmo de características 2 Detección de eventos codiciosos (UG) sin supervisión. Entrada: HH, índice de documentos para cada característica.1: Ordenar y seleccionar características en orden DPS descendente: SF1 ≥ SF2 ≥...≥ SF | HH |.2: k = 0. 3: para fi ∈ Hh do 4: k = k + 1. 5: init: ri ← fi, c (ri) = 1/sfi y hh = hh - fi.6: mientras que HH no está vacío Do 7: M = Arg Min M C (RI ∪ FM).8: Si c (ri ∪ fm) <c (ri) entonces 9: ri ← fm y hh = hh - fm.10: Else 11: Break While.12: Fin si 13: Fin mientras 14: Salida Ek como Eq.3. 15: Termine para ser contenido en múltiples eventos para que podamos detectar varios eventos que ocurren al mismo tiempo. Además, los eventos triviales que solo contienen características de año/mes (es decir, un evento que solo contenga 1 característica de AGU que se pueda identificar en un flujo de noticias de 1 año) podría eliminarse, aunque tales eventos tendrán un alto costo inherente y ya deberían clasificarse muy bajo. Tenga en cuenta que nuestro algoritmo UG solo requiere un parámetro dependiente de datos, el límite entre el espectro de potencia alta y baja, se establece una vez, y este parámetro se puede estimar fácilmente utilizando el algoritmo HS (algoritmo 1).7. Experimentos En esta sección, estudiamos el rendimiento de nuestro método de categorización de características y algoritmo de detección de eventos. Primero presentamos el conjunto de datos y la configuración experimental, luego evaluamos subjetivamente la categorización de características para HH, HL, LH, LL y SW. Finalmente, estudiamos el (a) problema de detección de eventos periódicos con el algoritmo 2. 7.1 conjunto de datos y configuración experimental El Corpus de Reuters contiene 806,791 Noticias en inglés del 08/20/1996 al 08/19/1997 en una resolución diaria. La versión 2 del software Lucene de código abierto [1] se utilizó para tokenizar el contenido de texto de noticias y generar el vector de palabras de documentos. Para preservar los tiempos de los verbos pasados/presentes/futuros sensibles al tiempo y las diferencias entre los sustantivos minúsculas y las entidades con nombre de mayúsculas y mayúsculas, no se realizó todavía. Dado que la eliminación de palabras de parada dinámica es una de las funcionalidades de nuestro método, no se eliminó ninguna palabra de parada. Sin embargo, eliminamos caracteres no ingleses, después de lo cual el número de características de Word asciende a 423,433. Todos los experimentos se implementaron en Java y se realizaron en una PC Pentium 4 de 3.2 GHz con el servidor Windows 2003 con 1 GB de memoria.7.2 Características de categorización Descargamos 34 palabras de parada bien conocidas utilizadas por el motor de búsqueda de Google como nuestras características de entrenamiento de semillas, que incluyen un, sobre, y, son, como, en, ser, por, de, para, desde, cómo, en, en, en, en, en, en,es, it, de, on, o, que, el, esto, to, era, qué, cuándo, dónde, quién, will, con, la, com, und, en y www. Excluimos las últimas cinco palabras de parada, ya que son poco comunes en las noticias. Al analizar solo las noticias más de 259 días de semana, calculamos el límite superior del espectro de potencia para las palabras de parada en 11.18 y el DFIDF correspondiente varía de 0.1182 a 0.3691. Cualquier característica f que satisfaga SF <= 11.18 y 0.1182 <= DFIDFF <= 0.3691 durante los días de la semana se considerará una palabra de parada. De esta manera, se encontraron 470 palabras de parada y se eliminaron como se visualizó en la Figura 9. Algunas palabras de parada detectadas son A (p = 65, s = 3.36, DFIDF = 0.3103), AT (P = 259, S = 1.86, DFIDF = 0.1551), GMT (P = 130, S = 6.16, DFIDF = 0.1628) y mucho(P = 22, s = 0.80, DFIDF = 0.1865). Después de la eliminación de estas palabras de parada, la distribución de las noticias de los días laborables y el fin de semana es más o menos correspondiente, y en los experimentos posteriores, utilizaremos el corpus completo (días laborables y fines de semana). El valor del espectro de potencia de límite superior de 11.18 para el entrenamiento de palabras de parada se seleccionó como el límite entre la alta potencia y el espectro de baja potencia. El límite entre la periodicidad alta y baja se estableció en 365/2 = 183. Las características de Word 422,963 (423433 - 470) se clasificaron en 4 conjuntos de características: HH (69 características), HL (1,087 características), LH (83,471 características) y LL (338,806 características) como se muestra en la Figura 10. En la Figura 10, cada nivel de gris denota la densidad relativa de las características en una región cuadrada, medida por Log10 (1 + DK), donde DK es el número de características dentro de la región cuadrada K-Th. De la figura, podemos hacer el 0 2 4 6 8 11.18 12879.82 1 65 100 130 259 S (F) P (F) LH HH LL HL Figura 9: Distribución de SW (Palabras de parada) en HH, HL, LH yLL regiones.0 5 11.18 50 100 200 300 400 500 1000 12879.82 1 2 4 6 8 20 50 100 100 183 364 365 S (F) P (F) 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 LH HH LL HL Figura 10: Distribución de categorizadoCaracterísticas sobre los cuatro cuadrantes (sombreado en escala log).Siguientes observaciones: 1. La mayoría de las características tienen S bajas y se pueden distinguir fácilmente de aquellas características que tienen una S mucho más alta, lo que nos permite detectar eventos periódicos importantes de eventos triviales seleccionando características con High S. 2. Las características en los cuadrantes HH y LH son aperiódicos, que están bien separadas (gran brecha horizontal) de las características periódicas. Esto permite detectar de manera confiable eventos aperiódicos y eventos periódicos de forma independiente.3. El límite (vertical) entre el espectro de potencia alta y baja no es tan transparente y el valor exacto será específico de la aplicación. Al verificar la distribución de dispersión de las características de SW en HH, HL, LH y LL como se muestra en la Figura 9, encontramos que 87.02%(409/470) de las palabras de parada detectadas se originaron en LL. La clasificación LL y los altos puntajes de palabras de parada DFIDF están de acuerdo con la noción generalmente aceptada de que las palabras de parada son igualmente frecuentes en todo el tiempo. Por lo tanto, establecer el límite entre el espectro de potencia alta y baja utilizando el SF superior de SW de SW es una heurística razonable.7.3 Detección de eventos aperiódicos Evaluaremos nuestras dos hipótesis, 1) Los eventos aperiódicos importantes pueden definirse mediante un conjunto de características de HH, y 2) los eventos aperiódicos menos informados pueden definirse mediante un conjunto de características de LH. Dado que no existen transmisiones de noticias de referencia para la detección de eventos (los conjuntos de datos TDT no son transmisiones adecuadas), evaluamos la calidad de los eventos detectados automáticamente al compararlos con eventos confirmados manualmente buscando a través del corpus. Entre las 69 características de HH, detectamos 17 eventos aperiódicos importantes como se muestra en la Tabla 1 (E1 - E17). Tenga en cuenta que toda la identificación tomó menos de 1 segundo, después de eliminar los eventos que contienen solo la función de mes. Entre los 17 eventos, aparte de las superposiciones entre E3 y E4 (ambos describen el mismo evento de rehenes), E11 y E16 (ambos sobre informes de la compañía), los 14 eventos identificados son extremadamente precisos y corresponden muy bien a los eventos principales del período del período. Por ejemplo, la derrota de Bob Dole, elección de Tony Blair, ataque de misiles contra Irak, etc. Recuerde que seleccionar las características para un evento debería minimizar el costo en la ecuación.2 de tal manera que 1) el número de características abarcan diferentes eventos, y 2) no todas las características relevantes para un evento serán seleccionadas, por ejemplo, la característica que Clinton es representativa de E12, pero dado que Clinton se relaciona con muchos otros eventos, su señal de dominio de tiempo esMuy diferente de las de otras características representativas como Dole y Bob. El número de documentos de un evento detectado se estima aproximadamente por el número de documentos indexados que contienen las características representativas. Podemos ver que los 17 eventos aperiódicos importantes son eventos reportados popularmente. Después de 742 minutos de tiempo de cálculo, detectamos 23, 525 menos informados de eventos aperiódicos de 83,471 características LH. La Tabla 1 enumera los 5 principales eventos aperiódicos detectados (E18 - E22) con respecto al costo. Descubrimos que estos 5 eventos son en realidad eventos muy triviales con solo unos pocos informes de noticias, y generalmente están subsumidos por algunos temas más grandes. Por ejemplo, E22 es uno de los eventos de rescate en un tema de secuestro de aviones. Una ventaja de nuestro algoritmo UG para descubrir eventos aperiódicos menos informados es que podemos detectar con precisión el verdadero período de eventos.7.4 Detección de eventos periódicos entre las 1.087 características de HL, se detectaron 330 eventos periódicos importantes dentro de los 10 minutos posteriores al tiempo de computación. La Tabla 1 enumera los 5 principales eventos periódicos detectados con respecto al costo (E23 - E27). Todos los eventos periódicos detectados son realmente válidos y corresponden a eventos periódicos de la vida real. El modelo GMM es capaz de detectar y estimar muy bien el período explosivo, aunque no puede distinguir la ligera diferencia entre cada lunes a viernes y todos los días de semana como se muestra en E23. También notamos que E26 es en realidad un subconjunto de E27 (juego de fútbol), que es aceptable ya que los resultados de la Liga de Sheffield se anuncian de forma independiente cada fin de semana.8. Conclusiones Este documento tomó una perspectiva completamente nueva de analizar las trayectorias de características como señales de dominio de tiempo. Al considerar la palabra frecuencias de documentos en dominios de tiempo y frecuencia, pudimos obtener muchas características nuevas sobre las transmisiones de noticias que anteriormente eran desconocidas, por ejemplo, las diferentes distribuciones de palabras de parada durante los días de semana y los fines de semana. Por primera vez en el área de TDT, aplicamos un enfoque sistemático para detectar automáticamente eventos importantes y menos informados, periódicos y aperiódicos. La idea clave de nuestro trabajo radica en las observaciones de que (a) los eventos periódicos tienen (a) características representativas periódicas y (no) eventos importantes tienen (in) características representativas activas, diferenciadas por sus espectros de potencia y períodos de tiempo. Para abordar el problema real de detección de eventos, se utilizó un enfoque basado en densidad de mezcla simple y efectivo para identificar explosiones de características y sus períodos estallados asociados. También diseñamos un algoritmo codicioso no supervisado para detectar eventos aperiódicos y periódicos, que tuvo éxito en la detección de eventos reales como se muestra en la evaluación en un flujo de noticias real. Aunque no hemos hecho ninguna comparación de referencia con otro enfoque, simplemente porque no hay trabajo previo en el problema abordado. El trabajo futuro incluye la evaluación del retiro de los eventos detectados para un flujo de noticias etiquetado, y comparar nuestro modelo con los métodos equivalentes más cercanos, que actualmente se limitan a los métodos de Kleinberg [12] (que solo pueden detectar ciertos tipos de eventos explosivos dependiendo de los parámetrosConfiguración), Fung et al.[9], y Swan y Allan [18]. Sin embargo, creemos que nuestro método simple y efectivo será útil para todos los profesionales de TDT, y será especialmente útil para el análisis exploratorio inicial de las transmisiones de noticias.9.

        "Manually monitoring all of them for important events has become difficult or practically impossible.",
        "In fact, the topic detection and tracking (TDT) community has for many years been trying to come up with a practical solution to help people monitor news effectively.",
        "Unfortunately, the holy grail is still elusive, because the vast majority of TDT solutions proposed for event detection [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] are either too simplistic (based on cosine similarity [5]) or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of parameters [9].",
        "The ineffectiveness of current TDT technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of the many online news alerts services such as the industryleading Google News Alerts [2], which generates more than 50% false alarms [10].",
        "As further proof, portals like Yahoo take a more pragmatic approach by requiring all machine generated news alerts to go through a human operator for confirmation before sending them out to subscribers.",
        "Instead of attacking the problem with variations of the same hammer (cosine similarity and TFIDF), a fundamental understanding of the characteristics of news stream data is necessary before any major breakthroughs can be made in TDT.",
        "Thus in this paper, we look at news stories and feature trends from the perspective of analyzing a time-series word signal.",
        "Previous work like [9] has attempted to reconstruct an event with its representative features.",
        "However, in many predictive event detection tasks (i.e., retrospective event detection), there is a vast set of potential features only for a fixed set of observations (i.e., the obvious bursts).",
        "Of these features, often only a small number are expected to be useful.",
        "In particular, we study the novel problem of analyzing feature trajectories for event detection, borrowing a well-known technique from signal processing: identifying distributional correlations among all features by spectral analysis.",

        "As an illustrative example, consider the correlation between the words Easter and April from the Reuters Corpus1 .",
        "From the plot of their normalized DFIDF in Figure 1(a), we observe the heavy overlap between the two words circa 04/1997, which means they probably both belong to the same event during that time (Easter feast).",
        "In this example, the hidden event Easter feast is a typical important aperiodic event over 1-year data.",
        "Another example is given by Figure 1(b), where both the words Unaudited and Ended 1 Reuters Corpus is the default dataset for all examples. exhibit similar behaviour over periods of 3 months.",
        "These two words actually originated from the same periodic event, net income-loss reports, which are released quarterly by publicly listed companies.",
        "Other observations drawn from Figure 1 are: 1) the bursty period of April is much longer than Easter, which suggests that April may exist in other events during the same period; 2) Unaudited has a higher average DFIDF value than Ended, which indicates Unaudited to be more representative for the underlying event.",
        "These two examples are but the tip of the iceberg among all word trends and correlations hidden in a news stream like Reuters.",
        "If a large number of them can be uncovered, it could significantly aid TDT tasks.",
        "In particular, it indicates the significance of mining correlating features for detecting corresponding events.",
        "To summarize, we postulate that: 1) An event is described by its representative features.",
        "A periodic event has a list of periodic features and an aperiodic event has a list of aperiodic features; 2) Representative features from the same event share similar distributions over time and are highly correlated; 3) An important event has a set of active (largely reported) representative features, whereas an unimportant event has a set of inactive (less-reported) representative features; 4) A feature may be included by several events with overlaps in time frames.",
        "Based on these observations, we can either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner. 1.1 Contributions This paper has three main contributions: • To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events.",
        "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
        "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
        "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
        "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
        "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
        "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
        "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
        "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
        "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
        "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
        "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
        "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
        "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
        "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
        "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
        "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
        "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
        "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
        "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
        "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
        "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
        "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
        "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
        "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
        "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
        "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
        "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
        "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
        "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
        "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
        "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
        "Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.",
        "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",
        "Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas. 0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Christmas(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=365 S=135.68 (b) Christmas(S:frequency) Figure 2: Feature Christmas with relative high Sf and long-term Pf .",
        "The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).",
        "Using the domain knowledge that soccer games have more matches every Saturday, which makes it a typical and heavily reported periodic event, we thus consider the value of Sf = 155.13 to be high. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) soccer(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=155.13 (b) soccer(S:frequency) Figure 3: Feature soccer with relative high Sf and short-term Pf .",
        "From the DFIDF trajectory for DBS in Figure 4(a), we can immediately deduce DBS to be an infrequent word with a trivial burst on 08/17/1997 corresponding to DBS Land Raﬄes Holdings plans.",
        "This is confirmed by the long period of Pf = 365 and low power of Sf = 0.3084 as shown in Figure 4(b).",
        "Moreover, since this aperiodic event is only reported in a few news stories over a very short time of few days, we therefore say that its low power value of Sf = 0.3084 is representative of unimportant events.",
        "The most confusing example is shown in Figure 5 for the word feature your, which looks very similar to the graph for soccer in Figure 3.",
        "At first glance, we may be tempted to group both your and soccer into the same category of HL or LL since both distributions look similar and have the same dominant period of approximately a week.",

        "One would have expected the periodicity of a stopword like your to be a day.",
        "Moreover, despite our DFIDF normalization, the weekday/weekend imbalance still prevailed; stopwords occur 4 times more frequently on weekends than on weekdays.",
        "Thus, the DPS remains the only distinguishing factor between your (Sf = 9.42) and soccer (Sf = 155.13).",
        "However, it is very dangerous to simply conclude that a power value of S = 9.42 corresponds to a stopword feature. 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) your(DFIDF:time) 0 5 10 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=9.42 (b) your(S:frequency) Figure 5: Feature your as an example confusing with feature soccer.",

        "Features from this set has moderate DPS and low but known dominant period.",
        "Since it is hard to distinguish this feature set from HL and LL only based on DPS, we introduce another factor called average DFIDF (DFIDF).",
        "As shown in Figure 5, features like your usually have a lower DPS than a HL feature like soccer, but have a much higher DFIDF than another LL noisy feature such as beenb.",
        "Since such properties are usually characteristics of stopwords, we group features like your into the newly defined stopword (SW) feature set.",

        "All experiments were implemented in Java and conducted on a 3.2 GHz Pentium 4 PC running Windows 2003 Server with 1 GB of memory. 7.2 Categorizing Features We downloaded 34 well-known stopwords utilized by the Google search engine as our seed training features, which includes a, about, an, are, as, at, be, by, de, for, from, how, in, is, it, of, on, or, that, the, this, to, was, what, when, where, who, will, with, la, com, und, en and www.",
        "We excluded the last five stopwords as they are uncommon in news stories.",
        "By only analyzing news stories over 259 weekdays, we computed the upper bound of the power spectrum for stopwords at 11.18 and corresponding DFIDF ranges from 0.1182 to 0.3691.",

        "Most features have low S and are easily distinguishable from those features having a much higher S, which allows us to detect important (a)periodic events from trivial events by selecting features with high S. 2.",
        "Features in the HH and LH quadrants are aperiodic, which are nicely separated (big horizontal gap) from the periodic features.",
        "This allows reliably detecting aperiodic events and periodic events independently. 3.",
        "The (vertical) boundary between high and low power spectrum is not as clearcut and the exact value will be application specific.",
        "By checking the scatter distribution of features from SW on HH, HL, LH, and LL as shown in Figure 9, we found that 87.02%(409/470) of the detected stopwords originated from LL.",
        "The LL classification and high DFIDF scores of stopwords agree with the generally accepted notion that stopwords are equally frequent over all time.",
        "Therefore, setting the boundary between high and low power spectrum using the upper bound Sf of SW is a reasonable heuristic. 7.3 Detecting Aperiodic Events We shall evaluate our two hypotheses, 1)important aperiodic events can be defined by a set of HH features, and 2)less reported aperiodic events can be defined by a set of LH features.",
        "Since no benchmark news streams exist for event detection (TDT datasets are not proper streams), we evaluate the quality of the automatically detected events by comparing them to manually-confirmed events by searching through the corpus.",
        "Among the 69 HH features, we detected 17 important aperiodic events as shown in Table 1 (e1 − e17).",
        "Note that the entire identification took less than 1 second, after removing events containing only the month feature.",
        "Among the 17 events, other than the overlaps between e3 and e4 (both describes the same hostage event), e11 and e16 (both about company reports), the 14 identified events are extremely accurate and correspond very well to the major events of the period.",
        "For example, the defeat of Bob Dole, election of Tony Blair, Missile attack on Iraq, etc.",
        "Recall that selecting the features for one event should minimize the cost in Eq. 2 such that 1) the number of features span different events, and 2) not all features relevant to an event will be selected, e.g., the feature Clinton is representative to e12 but since Clinton relates to many other events, its time domain signal is far different from those of other representative features like Dole and Bob.",
        "The number of documents of a detected event is roughly estimated by the number of indexed documents containing the representative features.",
        "We can see that all 17 important aperiodic events are popularly reported events.",
        "After 742 minutes of computation time, we detected 23, 525 less reported aperiodic events from 83,471 LH features.",
        "Table 1 lists the top 5 detected aperiodic events (e18 − e22) with respect to the cost.",
        "We found that these 5 events are actually very trivial events with only a few news reports, and are usually subsumed by some larger topics.",
        "For example, e22 is one of the rescue events in an airplane hijack topic.",
        "One advantage of our UG Algorithm for discovering less-reported aperiodic events is that we are able to precisely detect the true event period. 7.4 Detecting Periodic Events Among the 1,087 HL features, 330 important periodic events were detected within 10 minutes of computing time.",
        "Table 1 lists the top 5 detected periodic events with respect to the cost (e23 − e27).",
        "All of the detected periodic events are indeed valid, and correspond to real life periodic events.",
        "The GMM model is able to detect and estimate the bursty period nicely although it cannot distinguish the slight difference between every Monday-Friday and all weekdays as shown in e23.",
        "We also notice that e26 is actually a subset of e27 (soccer game), which is acceptable since the Sheffield league results are announced independently every weekend. 8.",
        "CONCLUSIONS This paper took a whole new perspective of analyzing feature trajectories as time domain signals.",
        "By considering the word document frequencies in both time and frequency domains, we were able to derive many new characteristics about news streams that were previously unknown, e.g., the different distributions of stopwords during weekdays and weekends.",
        "For the first time in the area of TDT, we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported, periodic and aperiodic events.",
        "The key idea of our work lies in the observations that (a)periodic events have (a)periodic representative features and (un)important events have (in)active representative features, differentiated by their power spectrums and time periods.",
        "To address the real event detection problem, a simple and effective mixture density-based approach was used to identify feature bursts and their associated bursty periods.",
        "We also designed an unsupervised greedy algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events, which was successful in detecting real events as shown in the evaluation on a real news stream.",
        "Although we have not made any benchmark comparison against another approach, simply because there is no previous work in the addressed problem.",
        "Future work includes evaluating the recall of detected events for a labeled news stream, and comparing our model against the closest equivalent methods, which currently are limited to the methods of Kleinberg [12] (which can only detect certain type of bursty events depending on parameter settings), Fung et al. [9], and Swan and Allan [18].",

DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",

                "Unfortunately, the holy grail is still elusive, because the vast majority of TDT solutions proposed for event detection [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] are either too simplistic (based on cosine similarity [5]) or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of parameters [9].",
                "The ineffectiveness of current TDT technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of the many online news alerts services such as the industryleading Google News Alerts [2], which generates more than 50% false alarms [10].",

                "Other observations drawn from Figure 1 are: 1) the bursty period of April is much longer than Easter, which suggests that April may exist in other events during the same period; 2) Unaudited has a higher average DFIDF value than Ended, which indicates Unaudited to be more representative for the underlying event.",

                "A periodic event has a list of periodic features and an aperiodic event has a list of aperiodic features; 2) Representative features from the same event share similar distributions over time and are highly correlated; 3) An important event has a set of active (largely reported) representative features, whereas an unimportant event has a set of inactive (less-reported) representative features; 4) A feature may be included by several events with overlaps in time frames.",
                "Based on these observations, we can either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner. 1.1 Contributions This paper has three main contributions: • To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events.",
                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the <br>word trajectory</br> with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
                "Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.",
                "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",
                "Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas. 0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Christmas(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=365 S=135.68 (b) Christmas(S:frequency) Figure 2: Feature Christmas with relative high Sf and long-term Pf .",

                "Using the domain knowledge that soccer games have more matches every Saturday, which makes it a typical and heavily reported periodic event, we thus consider the value of Sf = 155.13 to be high. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) soccer(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=155.13 (b) soccer(S:frequency) Figure 3: Feature soccer with relative high Sf and short-term Pf .",

                "This is confirmed by the long period of Pf = 365 and low power of Sf = 0.3084 as shown in Figure 4(b).",
                "Moreover, since this aperiodic event is only reported in a few news stories over a very short time of few days, we therefore say that its low power value of Sf = 0.3084 is representative of unimportant events.",

                "Manually monitoring all of them for important events has become difficult or practically impossible.",
                "In fact, the topic detection and tracking (TDT) community has for many years been trying to come up with a practical solution to help people monitor news effectively.",
                "Unfortunately, the holy grail is still elusive, because the vast majority of TDT solutions proposed for event detection [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] are either too simplistic (based on cosine similarity [5]) or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of parameters [9].",
                "The ineffectiveness of current TDT technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of the many online news alerts services such as the industryleading Google News Alerts [2], which generates more than 50% false alarms [10].",
                "As further proof, portals like Yahoo take a more pragmatic approach by requiring all machine generated news alerts to go through a human operator for confirmation before sending them out to subscribers.",
                "Instead of attacking the problem with variations of the same hammer (cosine similarity and TFIDF), a fundamental understanding of the characteristics of news stream data is necessary before any major breakthroughs can be made in TDT.",
                "Thus in this paper, we look at news stories and feature trends from the perspective of analyzing a time-series word signal.",
                "Previous work like [9] has attempted to reconstruct an event with its representative features.",
                "However, in many predictive event detection tasks (i.e., retrospective event detection), there is a vast set of potential features only for a fixed set of observations (i.e., the obvious bursts).",
                "Of these features, often only a small number are expected to be useful.",
                "In particular, we study the novel problem of analyzing feature trajectories for event detection, borrowing a well-known technique from signal processing: identifying distributional correlations among all features by spectral analysis.",

                "As an illustrative example, consider the correlation between the words Easter and April from the Reuters Corpus1 .",
                "From the plot of their normalized DFIDF in Figure 1(a), we observe the heavy overlap between the two words circa 04/1997, which means they probably both belong to the same event during that time (Easter feast).",

                "Other observations drawn from Figure 1 are: 1) the bursty period of April is much longer than Easter, which suggests that April may exist in other events during the same period; 2) Unaudited has a higher average DFIDF value than Ended, which indicates Unaudited to be more representative for the underlying event.",
                "These two examples are but the tip of the iceberg among all word trends and correlations hidden in a news stream like Reuters.",

                "A periodic event has a list of periodic features and an <br>aperiodic event</br> has a list of aperiodic features; 2) Representative features from the same event share similar distributions over time and are highly correlated; 3) An important event has a set of active (largely reported) representative features, whereas an unimportant event has a set of inactive (less-reported) representative features; 4) A feature may be included by several events with overlaps in time frames.",
                "Based on these observations, we can either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner. 1.1 Contributions This paper has three main contributions: • To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events.",
                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (<br>aperiodic event</br>) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
                "Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.",
                "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical <br>aperiodic event</br> with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",

                "The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).",
                "Using the domain knowledge that soccer games have more matches every Saturday, which makes it a typical and heavily reported periodic event, we thus consider the value of Sf = 155.13 to be high. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) soccer(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=155.13 (b) soccer(S:frequency) Figure 3: Feature soccer with relative high Sf and short-term Pf .",

                "This is confirmed by the long period of Pf = 365 and low power of Sf = 0.3084 as shown in Figure 4(b).",
                "Moreover, since this <br>aperiodic event</br> is only reported in a few news stories over a very short time of few days, we therefore say that its low power value of Sf = 0.3084 is representative of unimportant events.",
                "The most confusing example is shown in Figure 5 for the word feature your, which looks very similar to the graph for soccer in Figure 3.",
                "At first glance, we may be tempted to group both your and soccer into the same category of HL or LL since both distributions look similar and have the same dominant period of approximately a week.",

                "In fact, the topic detection and tracking (TDT) community has for many years been trying to come up with a practical solution to help people monitor news effectively.",
                "Unfortunately, the holy grail is still elusive, because the vast majority of TDT solutions proposed for event detection [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] are either too simplistic (based on cosine similarity [5]) or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of parameters [9].",
                "The ineffectiveness of current TDT technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of the many online news alerts services such as the industryleading Google News Alerts [2], which generates more than 50% false alarms [10].",
                "As further proof, portals like Yahoo take a more pragmatic approach by requiring all machine generated news alerts to go through a human operator for confirmation before sending them out to subscribers.",

                "Based on these observations, we can either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner. 1.1 Contributions This paper has three main contributions: • To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events.",
                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (<br>periodic event</br>) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a <br>periodic event</br>.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
                "Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.",
                "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",
                "Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas. 0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Christmas(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=365 S=135.68 (b) Christmas(S:frequency) Figure 2: Feature Christmas with relative high Sf and long-term Pf .",
                "The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).",
                "Using the domain knowledge that soccer games have more matches every Saturday, which makes it a typical and heavily reported <br>periodic event</br>, we thus consider the value of Sf = 155.13 to be high. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) soccer(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=155.13 (b) soccer(S:frequency) Figure 3: Feature soccer with relative high Sf and short-term Pf .",

                "This is confirmed by the long period of Pf = 365 and low power of Sf = 0.3084 as shown in Figure 4(b).",
                "Moreover, since this aperiodic event is only reported in a few news stories over a very short time of few days, we therefore say that its low power value of Sf = 0.3084 is representative of unimportant events.",

                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",

                "Manually monitoring all of them for important events has become difficult or practically impossible.",
                "In fact, the topic detection and tracking (TDT) community has for many years been trying to come up with a practical solution to help people monitor news effectively.",
                "Unfortunately, the holy grail is still elusive, because the vast majority of TDT solutions proposed for event detection [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] are either too simplistic (based on cosine similarity [5]) or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of parameters [9].",
                "The ineffectiveness of current TDT technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of the many online news alerts services such as the industryleading Google News Alerts [2], which generates more than 50% false alarms [10].",
                "As further proof, portals like Yahoo take a more pragmatic approach by requiring all machine generated news alerts to go through a human operator for confirmation before sending them out to subscribers.",
                "Instead of attacking the problem with variations of the same hammer (cosine similarity and TFIDF), a fundamental understanding of the characteristics of news stream data is necessary before any major breakthroughs can be made in TDT.",
                "Thus in this paper, we look at news stories and feature trends from the perspective of analyzing a time-series word signal.",
                "Previous work like [9] has attempted to reconstruct an event with its representative features.",
                "However, in many predictive event detection tasks (i.e., retrospective event detection), there is a vast set of potential features only for a fixed set of observations (i.e., the obvious bursts).",
                "Of these features, often only a small number are expected to be useful.",
                "In particular, we study the novel problem of analyzing feature trajectories for event detection, borrowing a well-known technique from signal processing: identifying distributional correlations among all features by <br>spectral analysis</br>.",

                "As an illustrative example, consider the correlation between the words Easter and April from the Reuters Corpus1 .",
                "From the plot of their normalized DFIDF in Figure 1(a), we observe the heavy overlap between the two words circa 04/1997, which means they probably both belong to the same event during that time (Easter feast).",

                "Other observations drawn from Figure 1 are: 1) the bursty period of April is much longer than Easter, which suggests that April may exist in other events during the same period; 2) Unaudited has a higher average DFIDF value than Ended, which indicates Unaudited to be more representative for the underlying event.",
                "These two examples are but the tip of the iceberg among all word trends and correlations hidden in a news stream like Reuters.",

                "In particular, it indicates the significance of mining correlating features for detecting corresponding events.",
                "To summarize, we postulate that: 1) An event is described by its representative features.",
                "A periodic event has a list of periodic features and an aperiodic event has a list of aperiodic features; 2) Representative features from the same event share similar distributions over time and are highly correlated; 3) An important event has a set of active (largely reported) representative features, whereas an unimportant event has a set of inactive (less-reported) representative features; 4) A feature may be included by several events with overlaps in time frames.",
                "Based on these observations, we can either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner. 1.1 Contributions This paper has three main contributions: • To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events.",
                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "<br>spectral analysis</br> techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use <br>spectral analysis</br> to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 <br>spectral analysis</br> for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
                "Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.",
                "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",
                "Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas. 0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Christmas(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=365 S=135.68 (b) Christmas(S:frequency) Figure 2: Feature Christmas with relative high Sf and long-term Pf .",
                "The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).",
                "Using the domain knowledge that soccer games have more matches every Saturday, which makes it a typical and heavily reported periodic event, we thus consider the value of Sf = 155.13 to be high. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) soccer(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=155.13 (b) soccer(S:frequency) Figure 3: Feature soccer with relative high Sf and short-term Pf .",
                "From the DFIDF trajectory for DBS in Figure 4(a), we can immediately deduce DBS to be an infrequent word with a trivial burst on 08/17/1997 corresponding to DBS Land Raﬄes Holdings plans.",
                "This is confirmed by the long period of Pf = 365 and low power of Sf = 0.3084 as shown in Figure 4(b).",
                "Moreover, since this aperiodic event is only reported in a few news stories over a very short time of few days, we therefore say that its low power value of Sf = 0.3084 is representative of unimportant events.",

                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",

                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",

                "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",
                "Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas. 0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Christmas(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=365 S=135.68 (b) Christmas(S:frequency) Figure 2: Feature Christmas with relative high Sf and long-term Pf .",
                "The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).",

                "In fact, the topic detection and tracking (TDT) community has for many years been trying to come up with a practical solution to help people monitor news effectively.",
                "Unfortunately, the holy grail is still elusive, because the vast majority of TDT solutions proposed for event detection [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] are either too simplistic (based on cosine similarity [5]) or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of parameters [9].",
                "The ineffectiveness of current TDT technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of the many online news alerts services such as the industryleading Google News Alerts [2], which generates more than 50% false alarms [10].",

                "A periodic event has a list of periodic features and an aperiodic event has a list of aperiodic features; 2) Representative features from the same event share similar distributions over time and are highly correlated; 3) An important event has a set of active (largely reported) representative features, whereas an unimportant event has a set of inactive (less-reported) representative features; 4) A feature may be included by several events with overlaps in time frames.",
                "Based on these observations, we can either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner. 1.1 Contributions This paper has three main contributions: • To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events.",
                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
                "Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.",
                "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",
                "Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas. 0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Christmas(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=365 S=135.68 (b) Christmas(S:frequency) Figure 2: Feature Christmas with relative high Sf and long-term Pf .",
                "The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).",
                "Using the domain knowledge that soccer games have more matches every Saturday, which makes it a typical and heavily reported periodic event, we thus consider the value of Sf = 155.13 to be high. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) soccer(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=155.13 (b) soccer(S:frequency) Figure 3: Feature soccer with relative high Sf and short-term Pf .",
                "From the DFIDF trajectory for DBS in Figure 4(a), we can immediately deduce DBS to be an infrequent word with a trivial burst on 08/17/1997 corresponding to DBS Land Raﬄes Holdings plans.",

                "Manually monitoring all of them for important events has become difficult or practically impossible.",
                "In fact, the topic detection and tracking (TDT) community has for many years been trying to come up with a practical solution to help people monitor news effectively.",
                "Unfortunately, the holy grail is still elusive, because the vast majority of TDT solutions proposed for event detection [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] are either too simplistic (based on cosine similarity [5]) or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of parameters [9].",
                "The ineffectiveness of current TDT technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of the many online news alerts services such as the industryleading Google News Alerts [2], which generates more than 50% false alarms [10].",
                "As further proof, portals like Yahoo take a more pragmatic approach by requiring all machine generated news alerts to go through a human operator for confirmation before sending them out to subscribers.",
                "Instead of attacking the problem with variations of the same hammer (cosine similarity and TFIDF), a fundamental understanding of the characteristics of news stream data is necessary before any major breakthroughs can be made in TDT.",
                "Thus in this paper, we look at news stories and feature trends from the perspective of analyzing a time-series word signal.",
                "Previous work like [9] has attempted to reconstruct an event with its representative features.",
                "However, in many predictive event detection tasks (i.e., retrospective event detection), there is a vast set of potential features only for a fixed set of observations (i.e., the obvious bursts).",
                "Of these features, often only a small number are expected to be useful.",
                "In particular, we study the novel problem of analyzing feature trajectories for event detection, borrowing a well-known technique from signal processing: identifying distributional correlations among all features by spectral analysis.",
                "To evaluate our method, we subsequently propose an unsupervised event detection algorithm for news streams. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 Easter April (a) aperiodic event 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 Unaudited Ended (b) periodic event Figure 1: Feature correlation (DFIDF:time) between a) Easter and April b) Unaudited and Ended.",
                "As an illustrative example, consider the correlation between the words Easter and April from the Reuters Corpus1 .",
                "From the plot of their normalized DFIDF in Figure 1(a), we observe the heavy overlap between the two words circa 04/1997, which means they probably both belong to the same event during that time (Easter feast).",
                "In this example, the hidden event Easter feast is a typical important aperiodic event over 1-year data.",
                "Another example is given by Figure 1(b), where both the words Unaudited and Ended 1 Reuters Corpus is the default dataset for all examples. exhibit similar behaviour over periods of 3 months.",
                "These two words actually originated from the same periodic event, net income-loss reports, which are released quarterly by publicly listed companies.",
                "Other observations drawn from Figure 1 are: 1) the bursty period of April is much longer than Easter, which suggests that April may exist in other events during the same period; 2) Unaudited has a higher average DFIDF value than Ended, which indicates Unaudited to be more representative for the underlying event.",
                "These two examples are but the tip of the iceberg among all word trends and correlations hidden in a news stream like Reuters.",
                "If a large number of them can be uncovered, it could significantly aid TDT tasks.",
                "In particular, it indicates the significance of mining correlating features for detecting corresponding events.",
                "To summarize, we postulate that: 1) An event is described by its representative features.",
                "A periodic event has a list of periodic features and an aperiodic event has a list of aperiodic features; 2) Representative features from the same event share similar distributions over time and are highly correlated; 3) An important event has a set of active (largely reported) representative features, whereas an unimportant event has a set of inactive (less-reported) representative features; 4) A feature may be included by several events with overlaps in time frames.",
                "Based on these observations, we can either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner. 1.1 Contributions This paper has three main contributions: • To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events.",
                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in <br>text stream</br>s as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from <br>text stream</br>s using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in <br>text stream</br>s [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
                "Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.",
                "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",
                "Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas. 0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Christmas(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=365 S=135.68 (b) Christmas(S:frequency) Figure 2: Feature Christmas with relative high Sf and long-term Pf .",
                "The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).",
                "Using the domain knowledge that soccer games have more matches every Saturday, which makes it a typical and heavily reported periodic event, we thus consider the value of Sf = 155.13 to be high. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) soccer(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=155.13 (b) soccer(S:frequency) Figure 3: Feature soccer with relative high Sf and short-term Pf .",
                "From the DFIDF trajectory for DBS in Figure 4(a), we can immediately deduce DBS to be an infrequent word with a trivial burst on 08/17/1997 corresponding to DBS Land Raﬄes Holdings plans.",
                "This is confirmed by the long period of Pf = 365 and low power of Sf = 0.3084 as shown in Figure 4(b).",
                "Moreover, since this aperiodic event is only reported in a few news stories over a very short time of few days, we therefore say that its low power value of Sf = 0.3084 is representative of unimportant events.",
                "The most confusing example is shown in Figure 5 for the word feature your, which looks very similar to the graph for soccer in Figure 3.",
                "At first glance, we may be tempted to group both your and soccer into the same category of HL or LL since both distributions look similar and have the same dominant period of approximately a week.",

                "One would have expected the periodicity of a stopword like your to be a day.",

                "In fact, the topic detection and tracking (TDT) community has for many years been trying to come up with a practical solution to help people monitor news effectively.",
                "Unfortunately, the holy grail is still elusive, because the vast majority of TDT solutions proposed for event detection [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] are either too simplistic (based on cosine similarity [5]) or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of parameters [9].",
                "The ineffectiveness of current TDT technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of the many online news alerts services such as the industryleading Google News Alerts [2], which generates more than 50% false alarms [10].",
                "As further proof, portals like Yahoo take a more pragmatic approach by requiring all machine generated news alerts to go through a human operator for confirmation before sending them out to subscribers.",
                "Instead of attacking the problem with variations of the same hammer (cosine similarity and TFIDF), a fundamental understanding of the characteristics of <br>news stream</br> data is necessary before any major breakthroughs can be made in TDT.",

                "Previous work like [9] has attempted to reconstruct an event with its representative features.",

                "In particular, we study the novel problem of analyzing feature trajectories for event detection, borrowing a well-known technique from signal processing: identifying distributional correlations among all features by spectral analysis.",

                "From the plot of their normalized DFIDF in Figure 1(a), we observe the heavy overlap between the two words circa 04/1997, which means they probably both belong to the same event during that time (Easter feast).",

                "To summarize, we postulate that: 1) An event is described by its representative features.",
                "A periodic event has a list of periodic features and an aperiodic event has a list of aperiodic features; 2) Representative features from the same event share similar distributions over time and are highly correlated; 3) An important event has a set of active (largely reported) representative features, whereas an unimportant event has a set of inactive (less-reported) representative features; 4) A feature may be included by several events with overlaps in time frames.",
                "Based on these observations, we can either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner. 1.1 Contributions This paper has three main contributions: • To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events.",
                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real <br>news stream</br> to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a <br>news stream</br>, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
                "Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.",
                "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",
                "Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas. 0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Christmas(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=365 S=135.68 (b) Christmas(S:frequency) Figure 2: Feature Christmas with relative high Sf and long-term Pf .",
                "The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).",
                "Using the domain knowledge that soccer games have more matches every Saturday, which makes it a typical and heavily reported periodic event, we thus consider the value of Sf = 155.13 to be high. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) soccer(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=155.13 (b) soccer(S:frequency) Figure 3: Feature soccer with relative high Sf and short-term Pf .",
                "From the DFIDF trajectory for DBS in Figure 4(a), we can immediately deduce DBS to be an infrequent word with a trivial burst on 08/17/1997 corresponding to DBS Land Raﬄes Holdings plans.",
                "This is confirmed by the long period of Pf = 365 and low power of Sf = 0.3084 as shown in Figure 4(b).",
                "Moreover, since this aperiodic event is only reported in a few news stories over a very short time of few days, we therefore say that its low power value of Sf = 0.3084 is representative of unimportant events.",
                "The most confusing example is shown in Figure 5 for the word feature your, which looks very similar to the graph for soccer in Figure 3.",
                "At first glance, we may be tempted to group both your and soccer into the same category of HL or LL since both distributions look similar and have the same dominant period of approximately a week.",

                "One would have expected the periodicity of a stopword like your to be a day.",

                "In fact, the topic detection and tracking (TDT) community has for many years been trying to come up with a practical solution to help people monitor news effectively.",
                "Unfortunately, the holy grail is still elusive, because the vast majority of TDT solutions proposed for event detection [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10] are either too simplistic (based on cosine similarity [5]) or impractical due to the need to tune a large number of parameters [9].",
                "The ineffectiveness of current TDT technologies can be easily illustrated by subscribing to any of the many online news alerts services such as the industryleading Google News Alerts [2], which generates more than 50% false alarms [10].",

                "A periodic event has a list of periodic features and an aperiodic event has a list of aperiodic features; 2) Representative features from the same event share similar distributions over time and are highly correlated; 3) An important event has a set of active (largely reported) representative features, whereas an unimportant event has a set of inactive (less-reported) representative features; 4) A feature may be included by several events with overlaps in time frames.",
                "Based on these observations, we can either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner. 1.1 Contributions This paper has three main contributions: • To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events.",
                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original <br>time series</br> as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
                "Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.",
                "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",
                "Clearly, the value of Sf = 135.68 is reasonable for a well-known bursty event like Christmas. 0 0.5 1 1.5 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) Christmas(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=365 S=135.68 (b) Christmas(S:frequency) Figure 2: Feature Christmas with relative high Sf and long-term Pf .",
                "The DFIDF trajectory for soccer is shown in Figure 3(a), from which we can observe that there is a regular burst every 7 days, which is again verified by its computed value of Pf = 7, as shown in Figure 3(b).",
                "Using the domain knowledge that soccer games have more matches every Saturday, which makes it a typical and heavily reported periodic event, we thus consider the value of Sf = 155.13 to be high. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 8/20/1996 12/8/1996 3/28/1997 7/16/1997 (a) soccer(DFIDF:time) 0 50 100 150 200 0.00 0.13 0.25 0.37 0.50 P=7 S=155.13 (b) soccer(S:frequency) Figure 3: Feature soccer with relative high Sf and short-term Pf .",
                "From the DFIDF trajectory for DBS in Figure 4(a), we can immediately deduce DBS to be an infrequent word with a trivial burst on 08/17/1997 corresponding to DBS Land Raﬄes Holdings plans.",
                "This is confirmed by the long period of Pf = 365 and low power of Sf = 0.3084 as shown in Figure 4(b).",
                "Moreover, since this aperiodic event is only reported in a few news stories over a very short time of few days, we therefore say that its low power value of Sf = 0.3084 is representative of unimportant events.",

                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
                "Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.",
                "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",

                "Based on these observations, we can either mine representative features given an event or detect an event from a list of highly correlated features.",
                "In this paper, we focus on the latter, i.e., how correlated features can be uncovered to form an event in an unsupervised manner. 1.1 Contributions This paper has three main contributions: • To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to categorize word features for heterogenous events.",
                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (<br>dft</br>): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. <br>dft</br> can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
                "Figure 2(a) shows the DFIDF trajectory for Christmas with a distinct burst around Christmas day.",
                "For the 1-year Reuters dataset, Christmas is classified as a typical aperiodic event with Pf = 365 and Sf = 135.68, as shown in Figure 2(b).",

                "Specifically, every word feature is categorized into one of the following five feature types based on its power spectrum strength and periodicity: 1) HH (high power and high/long periodicity): important aperiodic events, 2) HL (high power and low periodicity): important periodic events, 3) LH (low power and high periodicity): unimportant aperiodic events, 4) LL (low power and low periodicity): non-events, and 5) SW (stopwords), a higher power and periodicity subset of LL comprising stopwords, which contains no information. • We propose a simple and effective mixture densitybased approach to model and detect feature bursts. • We come up with an unsupervised event detection algorithm to detect both aperiodic and periodic events.",
                "Our algorithm has been evaluated on a real news stream to show its effectiveness. 2.",
                "RELATED WORK This work is largely motivated by a broader family of problems collectively known as Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [20, 5, 17, 4, 21, 7, 14, 10].",
                "Moreover, most TDT research so far has been concerned with clustering/classifying documents into topic types, identifying novel sentences [6] for new events, etc., without much regard to analyzing the word trajectory with respect to time.",
                "Swan and Allan [18] first attempted using co-occuring terms to construct an event.",
                "However, they only considered named entities and noun phrase pairs, without considering their periodicities.",
                "On the contrary, our paper considers all of the above.",
                "Recently, there has been significant interest in modeling an event in text streams as a burst of activities by incorporating temporal information.",
                "Kleinbergs seminal work described how bursty features can be extracted from text streams using an infinite automaton model [12], which inspired a whole series of applications such as Kumars identification of bursty communities from Weblog graphs [13], Meis summarization of evolutionary themes in text streams [15], Hes clustering of text streams using bursty features [11], etc.",
                "Nevertheless, none of the existing work specifically identified features for events, except for Fung et al. [9], who clustered busty features to identify various bursty events.",
                "Our work differs from [9] in several ways: 1) we analyze every single feature, not only bursty features; 2) we classify features along two categorical dimensions (periodicity and power), yielding altogether five primary feature types; 3) we do not restrict each feature to exclusively belong to only one event.",
                "Spectral analysis techniques have previously been used by Vlachos et al. [19] to identify periodicities and bursts from query logs.",
                "Their focus was on detecting multiple periodicities from the power spectrum graph, which were then used to index words for query-by-burst search.",
                "In this paper, we use spectral analysis to classify word features along two dimensions, namely periodicity and power spectrum, with the ultimate goal of identifying both periodic and aperiodic bursty events. 3.",
                "DATA REPRESENTATION Let T be the duration/period (in days) of a news stream, and F represents the complete word feature space in the classical static Vector Space Model (VSM). 3.1 Event Periodicity Classification Within T, there may exist certain events that occur only once, e.g., Tony Blair elected as Prime Minister of U.K., and other recurring events of various periodicities, e.g., weekly soccer matches.",
                "We thus categorize all events into two types: aperiodic and periodic, defined as follows.",
                "Definition 1. (Aperiodic Event) An event is aperiodic within T if it only happens once.",
                "Definition 2. (Periodic Event) If events of a certain event genre occur regularly with a fixed periodicity P ≤ T/2 , we say that this particular event genre is periodic, with each member event qualified as a periodic event.",
                "Note that the definition of aperiodic is relative, i.e., it is true only for a given T, and may be invalid for any other T > T. For example, the event Christmas feast is aperiodic for T ≤ 365 but periodic for T ≥ 730. 3.2 Representative Features Intuitively, an event can be described very concisely by a few discriminative and representative word features and vice-versa, e.g., hurricane, sweep, and strike could be representative features of a Hurricane genre event.",
                "Likewise, a set of strongly correlated features could be used to reconstruct an event description, assuming that strongly correlated features are representative.",
                "The representation vector of a word feature is defined as follows: Definition 3. (Feature Trajectory) The trajectory of a word feature f can be written as the sequence yf = [yf (1), yf (2), . . . , yf (T)], where each element yf (t) is a measure of feature f at time t, which could be defined using the normalized DFIDF score2 yf (t) = DFf (t) N(t) × log( N DFf ), where DFf (t) is the number of documents (local DF) containing feature f at day t, DFf is the total number of documents (global DF) containing feature f over T, N(t) is the number of documents for day t, and N is the total number of documents over T. 4.",
                "IDENTIFYING FEATURES FOR EVENTS In this section, we show how representative features can be extracted for (un)important or (a)periodic events. 4.1 Spectral Analysis for Dominant Period Given a feature f, we decompose its feature trajectory yf = [yf (1), yf (2), ..., yf (T)] into the sequence of T complex numbers [X1, . . . , XT ] via the discrete Fourier transform (DFT): Xk = T t=1 yf (t)e− 2πi T (k−1)t , k = 1, 2, . . . , T. DFT can represent the original time series as a linear combination of complex sinusoids, which is illustrated by the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT): yf (t) = 1 T T k=1 Xke 2πi T (k−1)t , t = 1, 2, . . . , T, where the Fourier coefficient Xk denotes the amplitude of the sinusoid with frequency k/T.",
                "The original trajectory can be reconstructed with just the dominant frequencies, which can be determined from the power spectrum using the popular periodogram estimator.",
                "The periodogram is a sequence of the squared magnitude of the Fourier coefficients, Xk 2 , k = 1, 2, . . . , T/2 , which indicates the signal power at frequency k/T in the spectrum.",
                "From the power spectrum, the dominant period is chosen as the inverse of the frequency with the highest power spectrum, as follows.",
                "Definition 4. (Dominant Period) The dominant period (DP) of a given feature f is Pf = T/ arg max k Xk 2 .",
                "Accordingly, we have Definition 5. (Dominant Power Spectrum) The dominant power spectrum (DPS) of a given feature f is Sf = Xk 2 , with Xk 2 ≥ Xj 2 , ∀j = k. 4.2 Categorizing Features The DPS of a feature trajectory is a strong indicator of its activeness at the specified frequency; the higher the DPS, the more likely for the feature to be bursty.",
                "Combining DPS with DP, we therefore categorize all features into four types: 2 We normalize yf (t) as yf (t) = yf (t)/ T i=1 yf (i) so that it could be interpreted as a probability. • HH: high Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic (Pf > T/2 ); • HL: high Sf , short-term periodic (Pf ≤ T/2 ); • LH: low Sf , aperiodic or long-term periodic; • LL: low Sf , short-term periodic.",
                "The boundary between long-term and short-term periodic is set to T/2 .",
                "However, distinguishing between a high and low DPS is not straightforward, which will be tackled later.",
                "Properties of Different Feature Sets To better understand the properties of HH, HL, LH and LL, we select four features, Christmas, soccer, DBS and your as illustrative examples.",
                "Since the boundary between high and low power spectrum is unclear, these chosen examples have relative wide range of power spectrum values.",
