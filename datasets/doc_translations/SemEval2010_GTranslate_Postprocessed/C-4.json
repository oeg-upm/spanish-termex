FT 5-2 Einsteinufer 25 D-l 0587 Berlin, Germany wolisz@ee.tu-berlin.de ABSTRACT Best effort packet-switched networks, like the Internet, do not offer a reliable transmission of packets to applications with real-time constraints such as voice. Thus, the loss of packets impairs the application-level utility. For voice this utility impairment is twofold: on one hand, even short bursts of lost packets may decrease significantly the ability of the receiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal playout is interrupted. On the other hand, some packets may be particular sensitive to loss as they carry more important information in terms of user perception than other packets. We first develop an end-to-end model based on loss runlengths with which we can describe the loss distribution within a flow. These packet-level metrics are then linked to user-level objective speech quality metrics. Using this framework, we find that for low-compressing sample-based codecs (PCM) with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be concealed well, whereas burst losses have a higher perceptual impact. For high-compressing frame-based codecs (G.729) on one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error propagation caused by the decoder filter memories, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state. Contrary to sample-based codecs we show that the concealment performance may break at transitions within the speech signal however. We then propose mechanisms which differentiate between packets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of packet loss. We designate these methods as intra-flow loss recovery and control. At the end-to-end level, identification of packets sensitive to loss (sender) as well as loss concealment (receiver) takes place. Hop-by-hop support schemes then allow to (statistically) trade the loss of one packet, which is considered more important, against another one of the same flow which is of lower importance. As both packets require the same cost in terms of network transmission, a gain in user perception is obtainable. We show that significant speech quality improvements can be achieved and additional data and delay overhead can be avoided while still maintaining a network service which is virtually identical to best effort in the long term.

INTRODUCTION Considering that a real-time flow may experience some packet loss, the impact of loss may vary significantly dependent on which packets are lost within a flow. In the following we distinguish two reasons for such a variable loss sensitivity: Temporal sensitivity: Loss of ADUs which is correlated in time may lead to disruptions in the service. Note that this effect is further aggravated by some interdependence between ADUs (i.e., that one ADU can only be decoded when a previous ADU before has successfully been received and decoded). For voice, as a single packet contains typically several ADUs (voice frames) this effect is thus more significant than e.g. for video. It translates basically to isolated packet losses versus losses that occur in bursts. Sensitivity due to ADU heterogeneity: Certain ADUs might contain parts of the encoded signal which are Application Data Unit: the unit of data emitted by a source coder such as a video or voice frame. 441 Figure 1: Schematic utility functions dependent on the loss of more (+l) and less (-1) important packets more important with regard to user perception than others of the same flow. Let us consider a flow with two frame types of largely different perceptual importance (we assume same size, frequency and no interdependence between the frames). Under the loss of 50% of the packets, the perceptual quality varies hugely between the case where the 50% of the frames with high perceptual importance are received and the tax where the 50% less important frames are received. Network support for real-time multimedia flows can on one hand aim at offering a lossless service, which, however, to be implemented within a pa&et-switched network, will be costly for the network provider and thus for the user. On the other hand, within a lossy service, the above sensitivity constraints must be taken into account. It is our strong belief that this needs to be done in a generic way, i.e., no application-specific knowledge (about particular coding schemes e.g.) should be necessary within the network and, vice versa, no knowledge about network specifics should be necessary within an application. Let us now consider the case that 50% of packets of a flow are identified as more important (designated by +l) or less important (-1) due to any of the above sensitivity constraints. Figure 1 a) shows a generic utility function describing the applicationlevel Quality of Service (QoS) dependent on the percentage of packets lost. For real-time multimedia traffic, such utility should correspond to perceived video/voice quality. If the relative importance of the packets is not known by the transmission system, the loss rates for the +l and -1 packets are equal. Due to the over-proportional sensitivity of the +l packets to loss as well as the dependence of the end-t* end loss recovery performance on the fl packets, the utility function is decreasing significantly in a non-linear way (approximated in the figure by piece-wise linear functions) with an increasing loss rate. Figure 1 b) presents the CBS~ where all +l packets are protected at the expense of -1 pa&&. The decay of the utility function (for loss rates < 50%) is reduced, because the +l packets are protected and the endto-end loss recovery can thus operate properly over a wider range of loss rates indicated by the shaded area. This results in a graceful degradation of the applications utility. Note that the higher the non-linearity of the utility contribution of the fl packets is (deviation from the dotted curve in Fig. 1 a), the higher is the potential gain in utility when the protection for +l packets is enabled. Results for actual perceived quality as utility for multimedia applications exhibit such a non-linear behavior*. To describe this effect and provide a taxonomy for different QoS enhancement approaches, we introduce a novel terminology: we designate mechanisms which influence QoS parameters between Bows (thus decrease the loss rate of one flow at the expense of other flows) as inter-flow QoS. Schemes which, in the presence of loss, differentiate between pa&& within a flow as demonstrated in Figure 1 above, provide intra-flow QoS enhancement. As QoS mechanisms have to be implemented within the network (hopby-hop) and/or in the end systems (end-to-end), we have another axis of classification. The adaptation of the senders bitrate to the current network congestion state as an intraflow QoS scheme (loss avoidance, [IS]) is difficult to apply to voice. Considering that voice flows have a very low bitrate, the relative cost of transmitting the feedback information is high (when compared e.g. to a video flow). To reduce this cost the feedback interval would need to be increased, then leading to a higher probability of wrong adaptation decisions. The major di6culty, however, is the lack of a codec which is truly scalable in terms of its output bitrate and corresponding perceptual quality. Currently standardized voice codecs ([17]) usually only have a 6xed output bitrate. While it has been proposed to switch between voice codeca ([2]), the MOS (subjective quality) values for the codecs employed do not differ much: e.g., theITU codecs G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726and G.711 cover a bitrate range from 5.3 kbitjs to 64 kbitjs while the subjective quality differs by less than 0.25 on a l-to-5 MOS scale ([4], 1: bad, 5: excellent quality). So when the availability of sutticient computing power is assumed, the lowest bitrate codec can be chosen permanently without actually decreasing the perceptual quality. For loss recovery on an end-to-end basis, due to the realtime delay constraints, open-loop schemes like Forward Error Correction (FEC) have been proposed ([2]). While such schemes are attractive because they can be used on the Internet today, they also have several drawbacks. The amount of redundant information needs to be adaptive to avoid taking bandwidth away from other flows. This adaptation is crucial especially when the fraction of traflic using redundancy schemes is large (181). If the redundancy is a source coding itself, like it has often been proposed ([7]), the comments from above on adaptation also apply. Using redundancy has also implications to the playout delay adaptation ([lo]) employed to de-jitter the packets at the receiver. Note that the presented types of loss sensitivity also apply to apWhile we have obtained results which confirm the shape of the overall utility curve shown in Fig. 1, clearly the utility functions of the +1/-l sub.flows and their relationship are more complex and only approximately additive. 442 Table 1: State and transition probabilities computed for an end-to-end Internet trace using a general Markov model (third order) by Yajnik et. al.

End-to-end mechanisms can reduce and shift such sensitivities but cannot come close to eliminate them. Therefore in this work we assume that the lowest possible bitrate which provides the desired quality is chosen. Neither feedback/adaptation nor redundancy is used, however, at the end-to-end level, identification/marking of packets sensitive to loss (sender) as well as loss concealment (receiver) takes place. Hop-by-hop support schemes then allow trading the loss of one packet, which is considered more important, against another one of the same flow which is of lower importance. We employ actual codecs and measure their utility in the presence of packet loss using objective speech quality measurement. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces packet- and user-level metrics. We employ these metrics to describe the sensitivity of VoIP traffic to packet loss in section 3. Section 4 briefly introduces a queue management algorithm which can be used for intra-flow loss control. In section 5, we present results documenting the performance of the proposed mechanisms at both the end-to-end and hopby-hop level. Section 6 concludes the paper. 2. METRICS 2.1 Packet-level metrics A general Markov model ([19, S]) which describes the loss process is defined as follows: Let P( Z(s) ] Z(s - m),... ,Z(s - 2),Z(s - 1) ) be the state transition probability of a general Markov model of order m, where Z(s) is the loss indicator function for the packet with the sequence number s. All combinations for the values (0 and 1) of the sequence Z(s-m), . . . , Z(s-2),Z(s-1) appear in the state space. As an example P( Z(s) = 1 ] Z(s - 2),Z(s1) = 01 ) gives the state transition probability when the current packet s is lost, the previous packet s - 1 has also been lost and packet s - 2 has not been lost. The number of states of the model is 2. Two state transitions can take place from any of the states. Thus, the number of parameters which have to be computed is 2m+1. Even for relatively small m this amount of parameters is difficult to be evaluated and compared. Table 1 shows some values for the state and transition probabilities for a general Markov model of third order measured end-to-end in the Internet by Yajnik et. al. ([19]). It is interesting to note that for all states with Z(s - 1) = 0 the probability for the next packet not to be lost (Z(s) = 0) is generally very high (> 0.8, in bold typeface) whereas when Z(s- 1) = 1 the state transition probabilities to that event cover the range of 0.15 to 0.61. That means that past no loss events do not affect the loss process as much as past loss events. Intuitively this seems to make sense, because a successfully arriving packet can be seen as a indicator for congestion relief. Andren et. al. ([l]) as well as Yajnik et. al. ([20]) both confirmed this by measuring the cross correlation of the loss- and no-loss-runlengths. They came to the result that such correlation is very weak. This implies that patterns of short loss bursts interspersed with short periods of successful packet arrivals occur rarely (note in this context that in &able 1 the pattern 101 has by far the lowest state probability). Thus, in the following we employ a model ([12]) which only considers the past loss events for the state transition probability. The number of states of the model can be reduced from 2m to m + 1. This means that we only consider the state transition probability P( Z(s) ] Z(s - k), . . . ,Z(s - 1) ) with Z(s - Ic + i) = 1 V i E [0, Ic - 11, where Ic (0 < k 5 m) is a variable parameter. We define a loss run length lc for a sequence of Ic consecutively lost packets detected at sj (sj > Ic > 0) with Z(sj - k - 1) = O,Z(sj) = 0 and Z(sj - k + i) = 1 V i E [0, Ic - 11, j being the j-th <burst loss event. Note that the parameters of the model become independent of the sequence number s and can now rather be described by the occurence ok of a loss run length k. We define the random variable X as follows: X = 0: no packet lost, X = k (0 < lc < m): ezactly lc consecutive packets lost, and X 2 k (0 < k < m): at least k consecutive packets lost. With this definition, we establish a loss run-length model with a finite number of states (m + 1) which gives loss probabilities dependent on the burst length. In the model, for every additional lost packet which adds to the length of a loss burst a state transition takes place. If a packet is successfully received, the state returns to X = 0. Thus, the state probability of the system for 0 < Ic < m is P(X 2 Zc). Due to the limited memory of the system, the last state X = m is just defined as crm consecutive packets lost, with P(X = m) being the state probability. Given the case of a finite number of packets a for a flow, which experiences d = cpC1 ]cok packet drops, we have the relative frequency pL,k = 2 (P(X = k) for a + 00) for the occurence of a loss burst of length lc. An approximation for the expectation of the random variable X can be computed as pi = cr==, #+L,k and identified with the mean loss rate. We can also approximate the state probabilities of the model by the cumulative loss rate p~,~,,~(k) = CrSkp~,,, (0 < k < m) and p~,~ = Cr.p=, (n--mzl)ot (k = m). The transition probabilities for 1 < lc < m can be computed easily as: p(k--l)(k) = P(X>klX>k-l)= P(X>knX>k-1) P(X>k-1) ZZ P ( X > k ) P(X>k-1) These conditional loss probabilities again can be approxPzl,cum(k) _ Cnm,k on i m a t e d by PL,cond@) = PL,cum(k-l) - C;Ek--l 0,. For 443 Figure 2: Loss run-length model with m + 1 states P(X = m]X = m) we have: PL,,,d(rn) = %Lf;:P Fig. 2 shows the Markov chain for the model. (1) Additionally, we also define a random variable Y which de scribes the distribution of burst loss lengths with respect to the bunt loss events j (and not to packet events like in the definition of X). We have the burst loss length rate ga = * as an estimate for P(Y = k). Thus, the mean burst loss length is g = h = e = CT==, kgb corresponding to E[Y] (average loss gap, [5]). The run-length model implies a geometric distribution for residing in state X = m. For the probability of a burst loss length of k packets we thus can compute estimates for performance parameters in a higher order model representation (note that here Y represent the random variable used in the higher-order models). For a three state model we have e.g. for P(Y = k): P(Y = k) = P(Y=k)=l-pm: k=l pn p;; (1 -pm): k 2 2 c-4 For the special case of a system with a memory of only the previous packet (m = l), we can use the runlength distribution for a simple computation of the parameters of the commonly-used Gilbert model (Fig. 3) to characterize the loss process (X being the associated random variable with X = 0: no packet lost, X = 1 a packet lost). Then the probability of being in state m can be seen BS the uncow ditional loss probability ulp and approximated by the mean loss (pr. = pi,,,,). Only one conditional loss probability clp for the transition 1 --t 1 exists: p~,E-d = CFL(~ - lbd (3) If losses of one flow are correlated (i.e., the loss probability of an arriving packet is itiuenced by the contribution to the state of the queue by a previous packet of the same flow and/or both the previous and the current packet see busty arrivals of other traffic, [15]) we have pal < clp and thus ulp 5 clp. For pal = elp the Gilbert model is equivalent to a l-state (Bernotilli) model with zllp = elp (no loss correlation). As in equation 2 we can compute an estimate for the probability of a burst loss length of k packets for a higher order model representation: B(Y = k) = clpk-(1 - clp) (4) Figure 3: Loss run-length (Gilbert model) model with two states Figure 4: Components of the end-to-end loss recovery/control measurement setup. 2.2 Objective Speech Quality Metrics Unlike the conventional methods like the Signal-t-Noise Ratio (SNR), novel objective quality measures attempt to estimate the subjective quality as closely as possible by modeling the human auditory system. In our evaluation we use two objective quality measures: the Enhanced Mod&d Bark Spectral Distortion (EMBSD, [21]) and the Measw ing Normalizing Blocks (MNB) described in the Appendix II of the ITU-T Recommendation P.861 ([18]). These two objective quality measure.~ are reported to have a very high correlation with subjective tests, their relation to the range of subjective test result values (MOS) is close to being linear and they are recommended as being suitable for the evaluation of speech degraded by transmission errors in real network environments such as bit errors and frame erasures ([18, 211). Both metrics are distance measures, i.e., a IB suit value of 0 implies perfect quality, the larger the value, the worse the speech quality is (in Fig. 5 we show an axis with approximate corresponding MOS values). For all simulations in this paper we employed both schemes. As they yielded very similar results (though MNB results generally exhibited less variability) we only present EMBSD results. 3. VOIP LOSS SENSITIVITY Figure 4 shows the components of the measurement setup which we will use to evaluate our approach to combined end-t-end and hopby-hop loss recovery and control. The 444 shaded boxes show the components in the data path where mechanisms of loss recovery are located. Together with the parameters of the network model (section 2.1) and the perceptual model we obtain a measurement setup which allows us to map a specific PCM signal input to a speech quality measure. While using a simple end-to-end loss characterization, we generate a large number of loss patterns by using different seeds for the pseudcerandom number generator (for the results presented here we used 300 patterns for each simulated condition for a single speech sample). This procedure takes thus into account that the impact of loss on an input signal may not be homogenous (i.e., a loss burst within one segment of that signal can have a different perceptual impact than a loss burst of the same size within another segment). By averaging the result of the objective quality measure for several loss patterns, we have a reliable indication for the performance of the codec operating under a certain network loss condition. We employed a Gilbert model (Fig. 3) as the network model for the simulations, as we have found that here higher order models do not provide much additional information. 3.1 Temporal sensitivity 3.1.1 Pa4 We first analyze the behaviour for ~-law PCM flows (64 kbit/s) with and without loss concealment, where the loss concealment repairs isolated losses only (speech stationarity can only be assumed for small time intervals). Results are shown for the AP/C concealment algorithm ([ll]). Similar results were obtained with other concealment algorithms. Figure 5 shows the case without loss concealment enabled where Gilbert model parameters are varied. The resulting speech quality is insensitive to the loss distribution parameter (elp). The results are even slightly decressing for an increasing clp, pointing to a significant variability of theresuits. In Figure 6 the results with loss concealment are depicted. When the loss correlation (dp) is low, loss concealment provides a significant performance improvement. The relative improvement increases with increasing loss (pulp). For higher clp values the cases with and without concealment become increasingly similar and show the same performance at clp x 0.3. Figures 5 and 6 respectively also contain a curve showing the performance under the assumption of random losses (Bernouilli model, ulp = elp). Thus, considering a given ulp, a worst case loss pattern of alternating losses (I(s mod 2) = l,l([s + l] mod 2) = 0) would enable a considerable performance improvement (with ok = OVk > 1: p~,cond = 0, Eq. 3). As we found by visual inspection that the distributions of the perceptual distortion values for one loss condition seem to approximately follow a normal distribution we employ mean and standard deviation to describe the statistical variability of the measured values. Figure 7 presents the perceptual distortion as in the previous figure but also give the standard deviation as error bars for the respective loss condition. It shows the increasing variability of the results with increasing loss correlation (clp), while the variability does not seem to change much with an increasing amount of loss (alp). On one hand this points to some, though weak, sensitivity with regard to heterogeneity (i.e., it matters which area of the speech signal (voiced/unvoiced) experiences a burst loss). On the other hand it shows, that a large number of different Figure 5: Utility curve for PCM without loss conc e a l m e n t (EMBSD) Figure 6: Utility curve for PCM with loss concealment (EMBSD) Figure 7: Variability of the perceptual distortion with 10s~ concealment (EMBSD) 445 Figure 8: Utility curve for the G.729 codec (EMBSD) loss patterns is necessary for a certain speech sample when using objective speech quality measurement to assess the impact of loss corwlation on user perception. 3.1.2 G.729 G.729 ([17]) uses the Conjugate Structure Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction (CS-ACELP) coding scheme and ooerates at 8 kbit/s. In G.729. a speech fmme is 10 ms in d&ion. For each frame, theG.7i9 encoder analyzes the input data and extracts the parameters of the Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) model such as linear prediction filter coefficients and excitation vectors. When a frame is lost or corrupted, the G.729 decoder uses the parameters of the previous frame to interpolate those of the lost frame. The line spectral pair coefficients (LSP3) of the last good frame are repeated and the gain coefficients are taken from the previous frame but they are damped to gradually reduce their impact. When a frame loss occurs, the decoder cannot update its state, resulting in a divergence of encoder and decoder state. Thus, errors are not only introduced during the time period represented by the current frame but also in the following ones. In addition to the impact of the missing codewords, distortion is increased by the missing update of the predictor filter memories for the line speo tral pairs and the linear prediction synthesis filter memo ries. Figure 8 shows that for similar network conditions the output quality of the G.729* is worse than PCM with loss concealment, demonstrating the compression versus quality tradeoff under packet loss. Interestingly the loss correlation (dp parameter) has some impact on the speech quality, however, the effect is weak pointing to a certain robustness of the G.729 codec with regard to the resiliency to consecutive packet losses due to the internal loss concealment. Rosenberg has done a similar experiment ([9]), showing that the difference between the original and the concealed signal with increasing loss burstiness in terms of a mean-squared error is significant, however. This demonstrates the importance of perceptual metrics which are able to include concealment LSPs are another representation of the linear prediction coefficients. Two G.729 frames are contained in a packet. Figure 9: Resynchronization time (in frames) of the G.729 decoder after the loss of k consecutive frames (k E [1,4]) as a function of frame position. (and not only reconstruction) operations in the quality assessment. 3.2 Sensitivity due to ADU heterogeneity PCM is a memoryless encoding. Therefore the ADU content is only weakly heterogeneous (Figure 7). Thus, in this section we concentrate on the G.729 coda. The experiment we carry out is to meawre the resynchronization time of the d* coder after k consecutive frames are lost. The G.729 decoder is said to have resynchronized with the encoder when the energy of the error signal falls below one percent of the energy of the decoded signal without frame loss (this is equivalent to a signal-t-noise ratio (SNR) threshold of 2OdB). The error signal energy (and thus the SNR) is computed on a per-frame basis. Figure 9 shows the resynchronization time (expressed in the number of frames needed until the threshold is exceeded) plotted against the position of the loss (i.e., the index of the first lost frame) for d&rent values of k. The speech sample is produced by a male speaker where an unvoiced/voiced (au) transition occurs in the eighth frame. We can see from Figure 9 that the position of a frame loss has a signilicant inlluence cm the resulting signal degradation, while the degradation is not that sensitive to the length of the frame loss burst k. The loss of unvoiced frames seems to have a rather small impact on the signal degradation and the decoder recovers the state information fast thereafter. The loss of voiced frames causes a larger degradation of the speech signal and the decoder needs more time to resyncbronize with the sender. However, the loss of voiced frames at an unvoiced/voiced transition leads to a significant degradation of the signal. We have repeated the experiment for different male and female speakers and obtained similar results. lsking into account the wed coding scheme, the above phenomenon could be explained as follows: Because voiced sounds have a higher energy than unvoiced sounds, the loss of voiced frames causes a larger signal degradation than the loss of unvoiced frames. However, due to the periodic property of voiced sounds, the decoder can conceal While on one hand we see that SNR n~easu~es often do not correlate well with subjective speech quality, on the other hand the large differences in the SNR-threshold-based resynchronization time clearly point to a significant impact on subjective speech quality. 446 Figure 10: Differential RED drop probabilities as a function of average queue sizes the loss of voiced frames well once it has obtained suflicient information on them. The decoder fails to conceal the loss of voiced frames at an unvoiced/voiced transition because it attempts to conceal the loss of voiced frames using the filter coefficients and the excitation for an unvoiced sound. Moreover, because the G.729 encoder uses a moving average filter to predict the values of the line spectral pairs and only transmits the difference between the real and predicted vaues, it takes a lot of time for the decoder to resynchronize with the encoder once it has failed to build the appropriate linear prediction filter. 4. QUEUE MANAGEMENT FOR INTRAFLOW LOSS CONTROL While we have highlighted the sensitivity of VoIP traffic to the distribution of loss in the last sections, we now want to briefly introduce a queue management mechanism ([13]) which is able to enforce the relative preferences of the ap plication with regard to loss. We consider flows with packets marked with +l and I1 (as described in the introduction) BS foreground traffic (FT) and other (best effort) flows as backaound traffic (BT). Packet marking, in addition to keeping the desirable property of state aggregration within the network core as proposed by the IETF Differentiated Services architecture, is exploited here to convey the intrbflow requirements of a llow. As it should be avoided to introduce reordering of the packets of a flow in the network we consider mechanisms for the management of a single queue with different priority levels. One approach to realize inter-flow service differentiation using a single queue is RIO (RED with IN and OUT, [3]). With RIO, two average queue sizes as congestion indicators are computed: one just for the IN (high priority) packets and another for both IN and OUT (low priority) packets. Packets marked as OUT are dropped earlier (in terms of the average queue size) than IN packets. RIO has been designed to decrease the clip seen by particular Bows at the expense of other flows. In this work, however, we want to keep the ulp as given by other parameters while modifying the loss distribution for the foreground traffic (FT). This amounts to trading the loss of a +l packet against a -1 packet of the same flow (in a statistical sense). Fig. 10 shows the conventional RED drop probability curve (po as a function of the average queue size for all arrivals avg), which is applied to all unmarked (0) traffic (background traffic: BT). The necessary relationship between the drop probabilities for packets marked as -1 and +l can be derived 85 follows (note that this relationship is valid both at the end-tend level and every individual hop): Let a = a0 + a+, +a-~ be the overall number of emitted packets by an FT flow and a,, + E [-l,O, +l] be the number of packets belonging to a certain class (where the 0 class corresponds to (unmarked) best effort traflic). Then, with a+, = a-1 = a,~, and considering that the resulting service has to be best effort in the long term, we have: aopo + a+lp+l + LIP-1 A ape Qlll@+l fP-1) = (a--oo)m P - l = zpo-p+1 (5) Due to this relationship between the drop probability for +l and -1 packets, we designate this queue management algorithm as Differential RED (DiERED). Figure 10 shows the corresponding drop probability curves. Due to the condition of a+, = (I-L = all, in addition to the conventional RED behaviour, the DiffRED implementation should also monitor the +l and -1 arrival processes. If the ratio of +l to -1 packets at a gateway is not 1 (either due to misbehaving flows or a significant number of flows which have already experienced loss at earlier hops) the -1 loss prob ability is decreased and the +l probability is increased at the same time thus degrading the service for all users. The shaded areas above and below the po(avg) curve (Fig. 10) show the operating area when this correction is added. In [13] it has been shown that using only the conventional RED average queue size avg for DSRED operation is not sufficient. This is due to the potentially missing correlation of the computed aug value between consecutive +l and -1 arrivals, especially when the share of the FT traftic is low. As this might result in a unfair distribution of losses between the FT and BT fractions, a specific avgl value is computed by sampling the queue size only at FT arrival instants. Thus, a service differentiation for foreground traffic is possible which does not differ from conventional RED behaviour in the long term average (i.e., in the ulp). 5. INTRA-FLOW LOSS RECOVERY AND CONTROL 5.1 Temporal sensitivity Considering a flow with temporal loss sensitivity, paragraph 3.1.1 has shown that a simple, periodic loss pattern enhances the performance of the end-to-end loss recovery. The pattern is not tied to particular packets, therefore a per-flow characterization with the introduced metrics is applicable. In this paragraph we assume that a flow expressed its temporal se*sitivity by marking its flow with an alternating pattern of ,c+l,>,c~l,,, 447 Figure 11: Comparison of actual and estimated Figure 12: Comparison of actual and estimated burst loss length rates as a function of burst length burst, loss length rates as a function of burst length k: three state run-length-based model k: two state run-length-based model (Gilbert.) Figures 11 and 12 show the rates for the actual and the estimated burst loss lengths for a three-state (m = 2) and a two=state (m = 1, Gilbert) model respectively6. We can observe that DiffRED shapes the burst probability curve in the desired way. Most of the probability mass is concentrated at, isolated losses (the ideal behaviour would be the occurence of only isolated losses (Ic = 1) which can be expressed with clp = 0 in terms of Gilbert model parameters). With Drop Tail an approximately geometrically decreasing burst loss probability with increasing burst length (Eq. 4) is obtainable, where the clp parameter is relatively large though. Thus, considering voice with temporal loss sensitivity as the foreground traffic of interest, with DifFRED a large number of short annoying bursts can be traded against a larger number of isolated losses and few long loss bursts (which occur when the queue is under temporary overload, i.e., awg > maxth, Fig. 10). We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2). This effect cannot be captured by the two state model (Eq. 4) which thus overestimates the burst loss length rate for Ic = 2 and then hugely underestimates it for k > 2. Interestingly, for Drop Tail, while both models capture the shape of the actual curve, the lower order model is more accurate in the estimation. This can be explained as follows: if the burst loss length probabilities are in fact close to a geometrical distribution, the estimate is more robust if all data is included (note that the run-length based approximation of the conditional loss probability P(X = mlX = m) only includes loss run-length occurences larger or equal to m: Eq. 1). sWe only discuss the results qualitatively here to give an example how an intra-flow loss control algorithm performs and to show how loss models can capture this performance. Details on the simulation scenario and parameters can be found in [12]. 5.2 Sensitivity due to ADU heterogeneity In paragraph 3.1.2 we have seen that sensitivity to ADU heterogeneity results in a certain non-periodic loss pattern. Thus, a mechanism at (or near) the sender is necessary which derives that pattern from the voice data. Furthermore, an explicit cooperation between end-to-end and hop by-hop mechanisms is necessary (Fig. 4). We use the result of paragraph 3.2 to develop a new packet marking scheme called Speech Property-Based Selective Differential Packet Marking (SPB-DIFFMARK). The DIFFMARK scheme concentrates the higher priority packets on the frames essential to the speech signal and relies on the decoders concealment for other frames. Figure 13 shows the simple algorithm written in a pseudocode that is used to detect an unvoiced/voiced (uw) transition and protect the voiced frames at, the beginning of a voiced signal. The procedure analysis0 is used to classify a block of Ic frames as voiced, unvoiced, or uv transition. send0 is used to send a block of Ic frames as a single packet with the appropriate priority (either fl, 0 or -1). As the core algorithm gives only a binary marking decision (protect the packet or not), we employ a simple algorithm to send the necessary -1 packets for compensation (Eq. 5): after a burst of +l packets has been sent, a corresponding number of -1 packets is sent immediately. State about the necessary number of to-be-sent -1 packets is kept in the event that the SPB algorithm triggers the next +l burst before all -1 packets necessary for compensation are sent. Thus, seen over time intervals which are long compared to the +1/-l burst times, the mean loss for the flow will be equal to the best effort case (Eq. 5). N is a pre-defined value and defines how many frames at the beginning of a voiced signal are to be protected. Our simulations (Fig. 9) have shown that the range from 10 to 20 are appropriate values for N (depending on the network loss condition). In the simulations presented below, we choose Ic = 2, a typical 448 protect = 0 fcm?ach (k frames) classify = analysis(k frames)] if (protect > 0) if (classify == unvoiced) protect = 0 if (compensation > 0) compensation = compensation-k send(k frames, -1) else send(k frames, 0) endif else send(k frames, +l) protect = protect-k compensation = compensation+k endif else if (classify == uvfransition) send(k frames, +l) protect = N - k compensation = compensation+k else if (compensation > 0) compensation = compensation-k send(k frames, -1) else send(k frames, 0) endif endif endif endfor Figure 13: SPB-DIFFMARK Pseudo Code value for interactive speech transmissions over the Internet (20ms of audio data per packet). A larger number of Ic would help to reduce the relative overhead of the protocol header but also increases the packetization delay and makes sender classification and receiver concealment in case of packet loss (due to a larger loss gap) more difficult. 5.2.1 En.d-to-end simulation description Due to the non-periodic loss pattern, we need to explicitly associate a drop probability with a single packet within an end-to-end model. Therefore we use a separate one-state Markov model (Bernouilli model) to describe the network behaviour as seen by each class of packets. Best effort packets (designated by 0 in Fig. 14) are dropped with the probability pc, whereas packets marked with +l and -1 are dropped with probabilities of p+i and p-1 respectively. This is a reasonable assumption with regard to the interdependence of the different classes in fact, as it has been shown that DiffRED (Figs. 11 and 12) achieves a fair amount of decorrelation of +l and -1 packet losses. Nevertheless to include some correlation between the classes we have set p+i = 10m3 pc for the subsequent simulations. This should The appropriateness of the simple end-to-end modeling used has been investigated in [12] with discrete event simulation using a multi-hop topology and detailed modeling of foreground and background traffic sources.

For a direct comparison with SPB-DIFFMARK, we evaluate a scheme where packets are alternatingly marked as being either -1 or +l (ALT-DIFFMARK, Figure 14). We furthermore include related inter-flow loss protection schemes. The first scheme uses full protection (FULL MARK, all packets are marked as +l). The SPB-MARK scheme operates similarly to SPB-DIFFMARK, but no -1 packets are sent for compensation (those packets are also marked as 0). For comparison we again use a scheme where packets are alternatingly marked as being either 0 or +l (ALT-MARK). Finally, packets of pure best effort flows are dropped with the probability po (NO MARK case in Fig. 14). For the SPB marking schemes the percentage of +l- and -l-marked packets respectively is 40.4% for the speech material used. We obtained similar marking percentages for other speech samples. The ALT marking schemes mark exactly 50% of their packets as being fl. 5.2.2 Results Figure 15 shows the perceptual distortion for the marking schemes dependent on the drop probability pc. The unprotected case (NO MARK) has the highest perceptual distortion and thus the worst speech quality*. The differential marking scheme (SPB-DIFFMARK) offers a significantly better speech quality even when only using a network service which amounts to best effort in the long term. Note that the ALT-DIFFMARK marking strategy does not differ from the best effort case (which confirms the result of paragraph 3.1.2). SPB-DIFFMARK is also even better than the inter-flow QoS ALT-MARK scheme, especially for higher values of pe. These results validate the strategy of our SPB marking schemes that do not equally mark all packets with a higher priority but rather protect a subset of frames that are essential to the speech quality. The SPB-FEC scheme ([12]), *We have also perfo rmed informal listening tests which confirmed the results using the objective metrics. 449 Figure 15: Perceptual Distortion (EMBSD) for the marking schemes and SPB-FEC which uses redundancy9 piggybacked on the main payload packets (RFC 2198, [7]) to protect a subset of the packets, enables a very good output speech quality for low loss rates. However, it should be noted that the amount of data sent over the network is increased by 40.4%. Note that the simulation presumes that this additionally consumed bandwidth itself does not contribute significantly to congestion. This assumption is only valid if a small fraction of trafhc is voice ([S]). The SPB-FEC curve is convex with increasing po, as due to the increasing loss correlation an increasing number of consecutive packets carrying redundancy are lost leading to unrecoverable losses. The curve for SPB-DIFFMARK is concave, however, yielding better performance for pe & 0.22. The inter-flow QoS ALT-MARK scheme (50% of the packets are marked) enhances the perceptual quality. However, the auditory distance and the perceptual distortion of the SPB-MARK scheme (with 40.4% of all packets marked) is significantly lower and very close to the quality of the decoded signal when all packets are marked (FULL MARK). This also shows that by protecting the entire flow only a minor improvement in the perceptual quality is obtained. The results for the FULL MARK scheme also show that, while the loss of some of the +l packets has some measurable impact, the impact on perceptual quality can still be considered to be very low. 6. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have characterized the behaviour of a samplebased codec (PCM) and a frame-based codec (G.729) in the presence of packet loss. We have then developed intraflow loss recovery and control mechanisms to increase the perceptual quality. While we have tested other codecs only informally, we think that our results reflect the fundamental difference between codecs which either encode the speech waveWe also used the G.729 encoder for the redundant source coding. form directly or which are based on linear prediction. For PCM without loss concealment we have found that it neither exhibits significant temporal sensitivity nor sensitivity to payload heterogeneity. With loss concealment, however, the speech quality is increased but the amount of increase exhibits strong temporal sensitivity. Frame-based codecs amplify on one hand the impact of loss by error propagation, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state. Contrary to sample-based codecs we have shown that the concealment performance of the G.729 decoder may break at transitions within the speech signal however, thus showing strong sensitivity to payload heterogeneity. We have briefly introduced a queue management algorithm which is able to control loss patterns without changing the amount of loss and characterized its performance for the loss control of a flow exhibiting temporal sensitivity. Then we developed a new packet marking scheme called Speech Property-Based Selective Differential Packet Marking for an efficient protection of frame-based codecs. The SPBDIFFMARK scheme concentrates the higher priority packets on the frames essential to the speech signal and relies on the decoders concealment for other frames. We have also evaluated the mapping of an end-to-end algorithm to interflow protection. We have found that the selective marking scheme performs almost as good as the protection of the entire flow at a significantly lower number of necessary highpriority packets. Thus, combined intra-flow end-to-end / hopby-hop schemes seem to be well-suited for heavily-loaded networks with a relatively large fraction of voice traffic. This is the case because they neither need the addition of redundancy nor feedback (which would incur additional data and delay overhead) and thus yield stable voice quality also for higher loss rates due to absence of FEC and feedback loss. Such schemes can better accomodate codecs with fixed output bitrates, which are difficult to integrate into FEC schemes requiring adaptivity of both the codec and the redundancy generator. Also, it is useful for adaptive codecs running at the lowest possible bitrate. Avoiding redundancy and feedback is also interesting in multicast conferencing scenarios where the end-to-end loss characteristics of the different paths leading to members of the session are largely different. Our work has clearly focused on linking simple end-to-end models which can be easily parametrized with the known characteristic of hopby-hop loss control to user-level metrics. An analysis of a large scale deployment of non-adaptive or adaptive FEC as compared to a deployment of our combined scheme requires clearly further study. 7.

Por lo tanto, la pérdida de paquetes perjudica la utilidad de nivel de aplicación. Para la voz, este deterioro de la utilidad es doble: por un lado, incluso las ráfagas cortas de paquetes perdidos pueden disminuir significativamente la capacidad del receptor para ocultar la pérdida de paquetes y el juego de la señal del habla se interrumpe. Por otro lado, algunos paquetes pueden ser particularmente sensibles a la pérdida, ya que llevan información más importante en términos de percepción del usuario que otros paquetes. Primero desarrollamos un modelo de extremo a extremo basado en longitudes de ejecución de pérdidas con las que podemos describir la distribución de pérdidas dentro de un flujo. Estas métricas a nivel de paquetes se vinculan a las métricas de calidad del habla a nivel de usuario a nivel de usuario. Usando este marco, encontramos que para códecs de muestra de baja compresión (PCM) con pérdidas de ocultamiento aisladas las pérdidas de paquetes pueden ocultarse bien, mientras que las pérdidas de ráfaga tienen un mayor impacto perceptivo. Para los códecs basados en marco de alta compresión (G.729) por un lado, el impacto de la pérdida se amplifica mediante la propagación de errores causado por las recuerdos del filtro de decodificador, aunque por otro lado tales esquemas de codificación ayudan a realizar la ocultación de pérdidas mediante la extrapolación de la extrapolación del estado del decodificador.. Contrariamente a los códecs basados en muestras, mostramos que el rendimiento de la ocultación puede romperse en las transiciones dentro de la señal del habla. Luego proponemos mecanismos que diferencian entre paquetes dentro de un flujo de datos de voz para minimizar el impacto de la pérdida de paquetes. Designamos estos métodos como recuperación y control de pérdida de flujo intra. En el nivel de extremo a extremo, se realiza la identificación de paquetes sensibles a la pérdida (remitente), así como el ocultamiento de pérdidas (receptor). Los esquemas de soporte de lúpulo por salto permiten (estadísticamente) intercambiar la pérdida de un paquete, que se considera más importante, contra otro del mismo flujo que es de menor importancia. Como ambos paquetes requieren el mismo costo en términos de transmisión de red, se puede obtener una ganancia en la percepción del usuario. Mostramos que se pueden lograr mejoras significativas en la calidad del habla y se pueden evitar datos adicionales y la sobrecarga de retrasos mientras mantienen un servicio de red que es prácticamente idéntico al mejor esfuerzo a largo plazo.

Introducción Teniendo en cuenta que un flujo en tiempo real puede experimentar alguna pérdida de paquetes, el impacto de la pérdida puede variar significativamente dependiendo de qué paquetes se pierden dentro de un flujo. A continuación, distinguimos dos razones para tal sensibilidad de pérdida variable: la sensibilidad temporal: la pérdida de ADU que se correlaciona en el tiempo puede conducir a interrupciones en el servicio. Tenga en cuenta que este efecto se agrava aún más por alguna interdependencia entre ADU (es decir, que una ADU solo puede decodificarse cuando se ha recibido y decodificado con éxito una ADU anterior). Para la voz, ya que un solo paquete contiene típicamente varias ADU (marcos de voz), este efecto es, por lo tanto, más significativo que, p.para video. Se traduce básicamente en pérdidas de paquetes aisladas versus pérdidas que ocurren en ráfagas. Sensibilidad debido a la heterogeneidad de ADU: ciertas ADU pueden contener partes de la señal codificada que son la unidad de datos de aplicación: la unidad de datos emitida por un codificador de origen, como un video o marco de voz.441 Figura 1: Funciones de utilidad esquemática que dependen de la pérdida de más (+l) y menos (-1) paquetes importantes más importantes con respecto a la percepción del usuario que otros del mismo flujo. Consideremos un flujo con dos tipos de cuadros de importancia perceptiva en gran medida diferente (suponemos que el mismo tamaño, frecuencia y sin interdependencia entre los cuadros). Según la pérdida del 50% de los paquetes, la calidad perceptiva varía enormemente entre el caso en el que se reciben el 50% de los cuadros con alta importancia perceptiva y se recibe el impuesto donde se reciben el 50% menos de cuadros importantes. El soporte de la red para los flujos multimedia en tiempo real puede tener un objetivo de ofrecer un servicio sin pérdidas, que, sin embargo, se implementará dentro de una red de PA y ET-Switched, será costoso para el proveedor de la red y, por lo tanto, para el usuario. Por otro lado, dentro de un servicio con pérdida, se deben tener en cuenta las restricciones de sensibilidad anteriores. Es nuestra fuerte creencia que esto debe hacerse de manera genérica, es decir, no debe ser necesario ningún conocimiento específico de la aplicación (sobre esquemas de codificación particulares, por ejemplo) dentro de la red y, viceversa, no se debe tener conocimiento sobre detalles de la red dentro deUna aplicación. Consideremos ahora el caso de que el 50% de los paquetes de un flujo se identifican como más importantes (designados por +L) o menos importantes (-1) debido a cualquiera de las restricciones de sensibilidad anteriores. La Figura 1 a) muestra una función de utilidad genérica que describe la calidad del servicio de nivel de aplicación (QoS) que depende del porcentaje de paquetes perdidos. Para el tráfico multimedia en tiempo real, dicha utilidad debería corresponder a la calidad percibida de video/voz. Si el sistema de transmisión no conoce la importancia relativa de los paquetes, las tasas de pérdida para los paquetes +L y -1 son iguales. Debido a la sensibilidad excesiva de los paquetes +L a la pérdida, así como a la dependencia del rendimiento de recuperación de pérdida final de T* en los paquetes FL, la función de utilidad está disminuyendo significativamente de una manera no lineal (aproximado en elFigura por funciones lineales por pieza) con una tasa de pérdida creciente. La Figura 1 b) presenta el CBS ~ donde todos los paquetes +L están protegidos a expensas de -1 Pa &&. La descomposición de la función de utilidad (para las tasas de pérdida <50%) se reduce, porque los paquetes +L están protegidos y la recuperación de pérdida de extremo al extremo puede funcionar correctamente en un rango más amplio de tasas de pérdida indicadas por el área sombreada. Esto da como resultado una degradación elegante de la utilidad de aplicaciones. Tenga en cuenta que cuanto mayor es la no linealidad de la contribución de utilidad de los paquetes FL (desviación de la curva punteada en la Fig. 1 A), mayor es la ganancia potencial en la utilidad cuando la protección para los paquetes +L está habilitada. Los resultados para la calidad percibida real como utilidad para aplicaciones multimedia exhiben un comportamiento tan no lineal*. Para describir este efecto y proporcionar una taxonomía para los diferentes enfoques de mejora de QoS, introducimos una nueva terminología: designamos mecanismos que influyen. Los esquemas que, en presencia de pérdida, diferencian entre PA && dentro de un flujo como se demuestra en la Figura 1 anterior, proporcionan una mejora de QoS de flujo intra-flujo. Como los mecanismos de QoS deben implementarse dentro de la red (Hopby-Hop) y/o en los sistemas finales (de extremo a extremo), tenemos otro eje de clasificación. La adaptación de la tasa de bits de los remitentes al estado actual de congestión de la red como un esquema QoS intraflow (evitación de pérdidas, [IS]) es difícil de aplicar a la voz. Teniendo en cuenta que los flujos de voz tienen una tasa de bits muy baja, el costo relativo de transmitir la información de retroalimentación es alto (en comparación, por ejemplo, con un flujo de video). Para reducir este costo, el intervalo de retroalimentación necesitaría aumentarse, y luego conducir a una mayor probabilidad de decisiones de adaptación incorrecta. Sin embargo, el principal Di6Culty es la falta de un códec que es realmente escalable en términos de su tasa de bits de salida y su calidad perceptiva correspondiente. Actualmente, los códecs de voz estandarizados ([17]) generalmente solo tienen una tasa de bits de salida 6xed. Si bien se ha propuesto cambiar entre la códeca de voz ([2]), los valores MOS (calidad subjetiva) para los códecs empleados no difieren mucho: por ejemplo, los códecs de Theitu G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726 y G.711 cubren un rango de tasa de bits de 5.3 kbitjs a 64 kbitjs, mientras que la calidad subjetiva difiere en menos de 0.25 en una escala L-a 5 MOS ([4], 1: mala, 5: excelente calidad). Entonces, cuando se supone la disponibilidad de potencia informática de suttent, el códec de tasa de bits más baja se puede elegir de forma permanente sin disminuir la calidad perceptiva. Para la recuperación de pérdidas sobre una base de extremo a extremo, debido a las limitaciones de retraso en tiempo real, se han propuesto esquemas de circuito abierto como la corrección de errores de avance (FEC) ([2]). Si bien tales esquemas son atractivos porque se pueden usar en Internet hoy, también tienen varios inconvenientes. La cantidad de información redundante debe ser adaptada para evitar quitar el ancho de banda de otros flujos. Esta adaptación es crucial, especialmente cuando la fracción de traflic usando esquemas de redundancia es grande (181). Si la redundancia es una fuente que codifica en sí, como a menudo se ha propuesto ([7]), también se aplican los comentarios de la adaptación anteriores. El uso de la redundancia también tiene implicaciones para la adaptación de retraso de playout ([LO]) empleado para desgastar los paquetes en el receptor. Tenga en cuenta que los tipos presentados de sensibilidad a la pérdida también se aplican a AP mientras hemos obtenido resultados que confirman la forma de la curva de utilidad general que se muestra en la Fig. 1, claramente las funciones de utilidad de los flujos sub. +1/-L y su relación son máscomplejo y solo aproximadamente aditivo.442 Tabla 1: Probabilidades de estado y de transición calculadas para una traza de Internet de extremo a extremo utilizando un modelo general de Markov (tercer orden) de Yajnik et.Alabama.[9] Estado 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 Probabilidad de probabilidad de probabilidad en el estado de I (S) = 0 de L (s) = 1 0.8721 0.9 7 7 9 0.0221 0.0 2 0 8 0.6 1 1 2 0.3 8 8 8 0.0 1 4 2 0.8 8 1 9 0.1181 0.0 1 0 2 0.2 7 1 0 0.7 2 9 0 0.0 2 0 8 0.9 2 7 8 0.0 7 2 2 0.0 0 3 6 0.4 1 9 8 0.5 8 0 2 0.0 1 0 2 0.8 1 0 9 0.1891 0.0481 0.1 5 3 9 0.8461 Plicaciones mejoradas por mecanismos de recuperación de pérdidas de extremo a extremo. Los mecanismos de extremo a extremo pueden reducir y cambiar tales sensibilidades, pero no pueden acercarse a eliminarlos. Por lo tanto, en este trabajo asumimos que se elige la tasa de bits más baja posible que proporciona la calidad deseada. Sin embargo, no se usa retroalimentación/adaptación ni redundancia en el nivel de extremo a extremo, tiene lugar la identificación/marca de los paquetes sensibles a la pérdida (remitente), así como el ocultamiento de pérdidas (receptor). Los esquemas de soporte de lúpulo por salto permiten el comercio de la pérdida de un paquete, que se considera más importante, contra otro del mismo flujo que es de menor importancia. Empleamos códecs reales y medimos su utilidad en presencia de pérdida de paquetes utilizando una medición objetiva de calidad del habla. El documento está estructurado de la siguiente manera: la Sección 2 presenta métricas a nivel de paquetes y usuarios. Empleamos estas métricas para describir la sensibilidad del tráfico VoIP a la pérdida de paquetes en la Sección 3. La Sección 4 introduce brevemente un algoritmo de gestión de colas que se puede utilizar para el control de pérdida de flujo intra. En la Sección 5, presentamos resultados que documentan el rendimiento de los mecanismos propuestos a nivel de extremo a extremo y hopby-hop. La Sección 6 concluye el documento.2. Métricas 2.1 Métricas a nivel de paquete Un modelo general de Markov ([19, s]) que describe el proceso de pérdida se define de la siguiente manera: Sea P (Z (S)] Z (S - M), ..., Z (S - S - S - S - S -2), z (s - 1)) ser la probabilidad de transición de estado de un modelo de orden m de orden m, donde z (s) es la función indicadora de pérdida para el paquete con el número de secuencia s.Todas las combinaciones para los valores (0 y 1) de la secuencia z (S-M) ,..., Z (S-2), Z (S-1) aparecen en el espacio estatal. Como ejemplo, p (z (s) = 1] z (s - 2), z (s1) = 01) da la probabilidad de transición del estado cuando se pierde el paquete actual, el paquete anterior S - 1 también se ha perdido yPaquete S - 2 no se ha perdido. El número de estados del modelo es 2. Dos transiciones estatales pueden tener lugar desde cualquiera de los estados. Por lo tanto, el número de parámetros que deben calcularse es 2M+1. Incluso para M relativamente pequeño, esta cantidad de parámetros es difícil de evaluar y comparar. La Tabla 1 muestra algunos valores para el estado y las probabilidades de transición para un modelo general de Markov de tercer orden medido de extremo a extremo en Internet por Yajnik et.Alabama.([19]). Es interesante observar que para todos los estados con z (s - 1) = 0 la probabilidad de que el siguiente paquete no se pierda (z (s) = 0) es generalmente muy alta (> 0.8, en negrita) mientras que cuando es cuandoZ (S- 1) = 1 Las probabilidades de transición de estado a ese evento cubren el rango de 0.15 a 0.61. Eso significa que los eventos anteriores sin pérdida no afectan el proceso de pérdida tanto como los eventos de pérdida pasados. Intuitivamente esto parece tener sentido, porque un paquete que llega con éxito puede verse como un indicador para el alivio de la congestión. Andren et.Alabama.([L]) así como Yajnik et.Alabama.([20]) confirmaron esto midiendo la correlación cruzada de las longitudes de salida de pérdida y sin pérdida. Llegaron al resultado de que tal correlación es muy débil. Esto implica que los patrones de ráfagas de pérdida corta intercalados con períodos cortos de llegadas de paquetes exitosos ocurren raramente (tenga en cuenta que en este contexto y el patrón 101 tiene, con mucho, la probabilidad de estado más baja). Por lo tanto, a continuación empleamos un modelo ([12]) que solo considera los eventos de pérdida pasados para la probabilidad de transición del estado. El número de estados del modelo puede reducirse de 2M a M + 1. Esto significa que solo consideramos la probabilidad de transición de estado P (z (s)] z (s - k), ..., z (s - 1)) con z (s - ic + i) = 1 v i e [0, IC - 11, donde IC (0 <k 5 m) es un parámetro variable. Definimos una longitud de ejecución de pérdida LC para una secuencia de paquetes IC consecutivamente perdidos detectados en SJ (SJ> IC> 0) con Z (SJ - K - 1) = O, Z (SJ) = 0 y Z (SJ - K +i) = 1 v i e [0, ic - 11, j siendo el evento J -th <Burst -Loss. Tenga en cuenta que los parámetros del modelo se independizan del número de secuencia y ahora pueden describirse por la ocurrencia OK de una longitud de ejecución de pérdida k.Definimos la variable aleatoria x de la siguiente manera: x = 0: no se perdió el paquete, x = k (0 <lc <m): Ezactly lc paquetes consecutivos perdidos, y x 2 k (0 <k <m): al menos k consecutivoPaquetes perdidos. Con esta definición, establecemos un modelo de longitud de ejecución de pérdidas con un número finito de estados (m + 1) que proporciona probabilidades de pérdida dependiendo de la longitud de la explosión. En el modelo, por cada paquete perdido adicional que se suma a la longitud de una explosión de pérdida, tiene lugar una transición de estado. Si un paquete se recibe con éxito, el estado regresa a x = 0. Por lo tanto, la probabilidad de estado del sistema para 0 <ic <m es p (x 2 zc). Debido a la memoria limitada del sistema, el último estado x = m se define como los paquetes consecutivos de CRM perdidos, siendo p (x = m) la probabilidad de estado. Dado el caso de un número finito de paquetes A para un flujo, que experimenta d = cpc1] gotas de paquetes COK, tenemos la frecuencia relativa pl, k = 2 (p (x = k) para a + 00) para la ocurrencia deUna explosión de pérdida de longitud lc. Una aproximación para la expectativa de la variable aleatoria X se puede calcular como PI = Cr ==, #+L, K e identificada con la tasa de pérdida media. También podemos aproximar las probabilidades de estado del modelo mediante la tasa de pérdida acumulativa P ~, ~ ,, ~ (k) = Crskp ~ ,,, (0 <k <m) y p ~, ~ = cr.p =, ((n-mzl) ot (k = m). Las probabilidades de transición para 1 <lc <m se pueden calcular fácilmente como: p (k-l) (k) = p (x> klx> k-l) = p (x> knx> k-1) P (x> k-1) ZZ P (x> k) P (x> k-1) Estas probabilidades de pérdida condicional nuevamente pueden ser aproxpzl, cum (k) _ cnm, k on i m a t e d por pl, cond@) = pl, cum (k-l)-c; ek-l 0 ,. Para 443 Figura 2: Modelo de longitud de ejecución de pérdida con estados m + 1 p (x = m] x = m) Tenemos: pl ,,, d (rn) = %lf ;: P La Fig. 2 muestra la cadena de Markov parael modelo.(1) Además, también definimos una variable aleatoria y que escribe la distribución de las longitudes de pérdida de ráfaga con respecto a los eventos de pérdida de Bunt J (y no para empaquetar eventos como en la definición de x). Tenemos la tasa de duración de pérdida de ráfaga GA = * como una estimación para P (y = k). Por lo tanto, la longitud media de pérdida de ráfaga es g = h = e = ct ==, kgb correspondiente a e [y] (brecha promedio de pérdida, [5]). El modelo de longitud de ejecución implica una distribución geométrica para residir en el estado x = m.Por lo tanto, para la probabilidad de una duración de pérdida de ráfaga de los paquetes K, podemos calcular estimaciones para los parámetros de rendimiento en una representación del modelo de orden superior (tenga en cuenta que aquí y representa la variable aleatoria utilizada en los modelos de orden superior). Para un modelo de tres estados tenemos, p.para p (y = k): p (y = k) = p (y = k) = l-pm: k = l pn p ;;(1 -pm): K 2 2 C-4 Para el caso especial de un sistema con una memoria de solo el paquete anterior (M = L), podemos usar la distribución de longitud de ejecución para un cálculo simple de los parámetros del comúnModelo Gilbert usado (Fig. 3) para caracterizar el proceso de pérdida (x es la variable aleatoria asociada con x = 0: sin paquete perdido, x = 1 un paquete perdido). Entonces, la probabilidad de estar en el estado M se puede ver BS la probabilidad de pérdida de ditción desacoplable y aproximada por la pérdida media (PR. = Pi ,,,,,). Solo existe una probabilidad de pérdida de pérdida condicional para la transición 1 - -T 1: P ~, E -D = CFL (~ -LBD (3) Si las pérdidas de un flujo están correlacionadas (es decir, la probabilidad de pérdida de un paquete que llega está afectado por elContribución al estado de la cola por un paquete anterior del mismo flujo y/o tanto el paquete anterior como el de la actualidad. Vea las llegadas tetonas de otro tráfico, [15]) tenemos PAL <CLP y, por lo tanto, ULP 5 CLP. Para PAL = ELP, el modelo Gilbert es equivalente a un modelo L-State (Bernotilli) con ZLLP = ELP (sin correlación de pérdida). Como en la ecuación 2, podemos calcular una estimación para la probabilidad de una pérdida de pérdida de ráfaga de los paquetes K para una representación del modelo de orden superior: B (y = K) = CLPK- (1- CLP) (4) Figura 3: Run- Pérdico-Modelo de longitud (modelo Gilbert) con dos estados Figura 4: Componentes de la configuración de medición de recuperación/control de pérdida de extremo a extremo.2.2 Métricas objetivas de calidad del habla A diferencia de los métodos convencionales como la relación señal-T-Noise (SNR), las nuevas medidas de calidad del objetivo intentan estimar la calidad subjetiva lo más estrechamente posible modelando el sistema auditivo humano. En nuestra evaluación utilizamos dos medidas de calidad objetivo: la distorsión espectral de Bark Mod & D mejorada (EMBSD, [21]) y los bloques de normalización de medidas (MNB) descritos en el Apéndice II de la recomendación de ITU-T p.861 ([18]). Se informa que estas dos medidas de calidad objetivo. ~ Tienen una correlación muy alta con las pruebas subjetivas, su relación con el rango de valores de resultados de prueba subjetivos (MOS) está cerca de ser lineal y se recomienda ser adecuado para la evaluación del habla degradadapor errores de transmisión en entornos de red reales, como errores de bits y borrados de cuadros ([18, 211). Ambas métricas son medidas de distancia, es decir, un valor de traje IB de 0 implica una calidad perfecta, cuanto mayor sea el valor, peor será la calidad del habla (en la Fig. 5 mostramos un eje con valores de MOS correspondientes correspondientes). Para todas las simulaciones en este documento empleamos ambos esquemas. Como arrojaron resultados muy similares (aunque los resultados de MNB generalmente exhibieron menos variabilidad) solo presentamos resultados de EMBSD.3. Sensibilidad a la pérdida de VoIP La Figura 4 muestra los componentes de la configuración de medición que utilizaremos para evaluar nuestro enfoque para la recuperación y el control combinado de la pérdida de extremo-t-to-hop. Los 444 cuadros sombreados muestran los componentes en la ruta de datos donde se encuentran mecanismos de recuperación de pérdidas. Junto con los parámetros del modelo de red (Sección 2.1) y el modelo perceptivo, obtenemos una configuración de medición que nos permite asignar una entrada de señal PCM específica a una medida de calidad del habla. Mientras usamos una caracterización simple de pérdida de extremo a extremo, generamos una gran cantidad de patrones de pérdida mediante el uso de diferentes semillas para el generador de números pseudcerandom (para los resultados presentados aquí utilizamos 300 patrones para cada condición simulada para una sola muestra de voz). Este procedimiento tiene en cuenta así que el impacto de la pérdida en una señal de entrada puede no ser homogéneo (es decir, una explosión de pérdida dentro de un segmento de esa señal puede tener un impacto perceptual diferente que una explosión de pérdida del mismo tamaño dentro de otro segmento). Al promediar el resultado de la medida de calidad objetivo para varios patrones de pérdida, tenemos una indicación confiable para el rendimiento del códec que opera bajo una determinada condición de pérdida de red. Empleamos un modelo de Gilbert (Fig. 3) como el modelo de red para las simulaciones, ya que hemos encontrado que aquí los modelos de orden superior no proporcionan mucha información adicional.3.1 Sensibilidad temporal 3.1.1 PA4 Primero analizamos el comportamiento para los flujos de PCM de la ley (64 kbit/s) con y sin pérdidas de ocultación, donde el ocultamiento de pérdidas repara solo las pérdidas aisladas (solo la estacionariedad del habla solo se puede suponer durante intervalos de tiempo pequeños). Los resultados se muestran para el algoritmo de ocultación AP/C ([LL]). Se obtuvieron resultados similares con otros algoritmos de ocultación. La Figura 5 muestra la ocultación de caso sin pérdida habilitada donde se varían los parámetros del modelo Gilbert. La calidad del habla resultante es insensible al parámetro de distribución de pérdidas (ELP). Los resultados incluso se desadesan ligeramente para un CLP en aumento, apuntando a una variabilidad significativa de treesuits. En la Figura 6 se representan los resultados con el ocultamiento de pérdidas. Cuando la correlación de pérdida (DP) es baja, el ocultamiento de la pérdida proporciona una mejora significativa del rendimiento. La mejora relativa aumenta con el aumento de la pérdida (PULP). Para valores de CLP más altos, los casos con y sin ocultamiento se vuelven cada vez más similares y muestran el mismo rendimiento en CLP x 0.3. Las Figuras 5 y 6 respectivamente también contienen una curva que muestra el rendimiento bajo el supuesto de pérdidas aleatorias (modelo Bernouilli, ULP = ELP). Por lo tanto, teniendo en cuenta un ULP dado, un patrón de pérdida de peor de los casos de pérdidas alternativas (I (S Mod 2) = L, L ([S + L] mod 2) = 0) habilitaría una mejora considerable del rendimiento (con OK = OVK>1: P ~, cond = 0, Eq. 3). Como encontramos por inspección visual que las distribuciones de los valores de distorsión perceptiva para una condición de pérdida parecen seguir aproximadamente una distribución normal que empleamos la media y la desviación estándar para describir la variabilidad estadística de los valores medidos. La Figura 7 presenta la distorsión perceptiva como en la figura anterior, pero también da la desviación estándar como barras de error para la condición de pérdida respectiva. Muestra la variabilidad creciente de los resultados con la creciente correlación de pérdida (CLP), mientras que la variabilidad no parece cambiar mucho con una cantidad creciente de pérdida (ALP). Por un lado, esto apunta a algunos, aunque débiles, la sensibilidad con respecto a la heterogeneidad (es decir, importa qué área de la señal del habla (expresada/sin voz) experimenta una pérdida de explosión). Por otro lado, muestra que un gran número de diferentes figura 5: curva de utilidad para PCM sin pérdida en un a l m e n t (EMBSD) Figura 6: Curva de utilidad para PCM con ocultamiento de pérdidas (EMBSD) Figura 7: Variabilidad de la distorsión perceptiva con 10S~ Ocultación (EMBSD) 445 Figura 8: Curva de utilidad para los patrones de pérdida del códec G.729 (EMBSD) es necesario para una determinada muestra de voz cuando se utiliza la medición objetiva de calidad del habla para evaluar el impacto de la corwlación de pérdidas en la percepción del usuario.3.1.2 G.729 G.729 ([17]) utiliza el esquema de codificación de predicción lineal excitada de estructura conjugada (CS-ACELP) y se ooerata a 8 kbit/s. En G.729.Un discurso es 10 ms en d & ion. Para cada cuadro, el codificador de TEG.7I9 analiza los datos de entrada y extrae los parámetros del modelo de predicción lineal excitada del código (CELP), como coeficientes de filtro de predicción lineal y vectores de excitación. Cuando se pierde o corrompe un marco, el decodificador G.729 usa los parámetros del marco anterior para interpolar los del marco perdido. Los coeficientes de pares espectrales de línea (LSP3) del último buen marco se repiten y los coeficientes de ganancia se toman del marco anterior, pero están amortiguados para reducir gradualmente su impacto. Cuando ocurre una pérdida de cuadro, el decodificador no puede actualizar su estado, lo que resulta en una divergencia del estado del codificador y el decodificador. Por lo tanto, los errores no solo se introducen durante el período de tiempo representado por el marco actual sino también en los siguientes. Además del impacto de las codewords faltantes, la distorsión se incrementa mediante la actualización faltante de las recuerdos del filtro predictor para los pares de speo tral de línea y las memorias de filtro de síntesis de predicción lineal. La Figura 8 muestra que para condiciones de red similares, la calidad de salida del G.729* es peor que PCM con el ocultamiento de pérdidas, lo que demuestra la compresión versus la compensación de calidad bajo pérdida de paquetes. Curiosamente, la correlación de pérdida (parámetro DP) tiene algún impacto en la calidad del habla, sin embargo, el efecto es débil apuntando a una cierta robustez del códec G.729 con respecto a la resistencia a las pérdidas de paquetes consecutivos debido a la ocultación de pérdida interna. Rosenberg ha realizado un experimento similar ([9]), lo que demuestra que la diferencia entre la señal original y la oculta con el aumento de la ruptura de la pérdida en términos de un error cuadrado medio es significativa. Esto demuestra la importancia de las métricas perceptivas que pueden incluir el ocultamiento Los LSP son otra representación de los coeficientes de predicción lineal. Dos cuadros G.729 están contenidos en un paquete. Figura 9: Tiempo de resincronización (en los marcos) del decodificador G.729 después de la pérdida de k marcos consecutivos (K E [1,4]) en función de la posición del marco.(y no solo la reconstrucción) operaciones en la evaluación de calidad.3.2 Sensibilidad debido a la heterogeneidad ADU PCM es una codificación sin memoria. Por lo tanto, el contenido de ADU solo es débilmente heterogéneo (Figura 7). Por lo tanto, en esta sección nos concentramos en la coda G.729. El experimento que llevamos a cabo es medir el tiempo de resincronización del codificador D* después de que se pierdan los marcos consecutivos. Se dice que el decodificador G.729 se ha resincronizado con el codificador cuando la energía de la señal de error cae por debajo del uno por ciento de la energía de la señal decodificada sin pérdida de marco (esto es equivalente a un umbral de relación señal-toise (SNR)de 2odb). La energía de la señal de error (y, por lo tanto, la SNR) se calcula por marco. La Figura 9 muestra el tiempo de resincronización (expresado en el número de cuadros necesarios hasta que se excede el umbral) trazado contra la posición de la pérdida (es decir, el índice del primer cuadro perdido) para los valores de d & rent de k.La muestra del habla es producida por un hablante masculino donde se produce una transición sin voz/voz (AU) en el octavo cuadro. Podemos ver en la Figura 9 que la posición de una pérdida de marco tiene una insluencia significativa CM de la degradación de la señal resultante, mientras que la degradación no es tan sensible a la longitud de la ráfaga de pérdida de marco k.La pérdida de marcos sin voz parece tener un impacto bastante pequeño en la degradación de la señal y el decodificador recupera la información del estado rápidamente a partir de entonces. La pérdida de marcos expresados provoca una mayor degradación de la señal del habla y el decodificador necesita más tiempo para resincronizar con el remitente. Sin embargo, la pérdida de marcos sonoros en una transición sin voz/expresa conduce a una degradación significativa de la señal. Hemos repetido el experimento para diferentes hablantes masculinos y femeninos y obtuvimos resultados similares.Con cuenta en cuenta el esquema de codificación WED, el fenómeno anterior podría explicarse de la siguiente manera: Debido a que los sonidos con voz tienen una energía más alta que los sonidos no con voz, la pérdida de marcos con voz provoca una degradación de señal más grande que la pérdida de marcos sin divulgar. Sin embargo, debido a la propiedad periódica de los sonidos expresados, el decodificador puede ocultar, mientras que, por un lado, vemos que las n.-El tiempo de resincronización basado en el tiempo apunta claramente a un impacto significativo en la calidad subjetiva del habla.446 Figura 10: Probabilidades diferenciales de caída roja en función de los tamaños de cola promedio La pérdida de marcos con voz bien una vez que ha obtenido información suficiente sobre ellos. El decodificador no oculta la pérdida de marcos con voz en una transición sin voz/expresa porque intenta ocultar la pérdida de marcos con voz utilizando los coeficientes de filtro y la excitación para un sonido sin voz. Además, debido a que el codificador G.729 usa un filtro de promedio móvil para predecir los valores de los pares espectrales de línea y solo transmite la diferencia entre los vaues reales y predichos, el decodificador lleva mucho tiempo resincronizar con el codificador una vezno ha podido construir el filtro de predicción lineal apropiado.4. Gestión de la cola para el control de pérdida de flujo intraflojo Si bien hemos destacado la sensibilidad del tráfico de VoIP a la distribución de la pérdida en las últimas secciones, ahora queremos introducir brevemente un mecanismo de gestión de la cola ([13]) que puede hacer cumplir las preferencias relativas de lasAplicación con respecto a la pérdida. Consideramos flujos con paquetes marcados con +L e I1 (como se describe en la introducción) El tráfico de primer plano BS (FT) y otros (mejor esfuerzo) fluyen como tráfico de retroceso (BT). El marcado de paquetes, además de mantener la propiedad deseable de la agregación estatal dentro del núcleo de la red según lo propuesto por la arquitectura de servicios diferenciados IETF, se explota aquí para transmitir los requisitos de flujo intrb de un LLOW. Como se debe evitar introducir el reordenamiento de los paquetes de un flujo en la red, consideramos mecanismos para la gestión de una sola cola con diferentes niveles de prioridad. Un enfoque para realizar la diferenciación de servicios entre flujos utilizando una sola cola es Río (rojo con entradas y fuera, [3]). Con Río, se calculan dos tamaños de cola promedio como indicadores de congestión: uno solo para los paquetes IN (de alta prioridad) y otro para los paquetes dentro y fuera (de baja prioridad). Los paquetes marcados como Out se eliminan antes (en términos del tamaño promedio de la cola) que en los paquetes. Río ha sido diseñado para disminuir el clip visto por arcos particulares a expensas de otros flujos. En este trabajo, sin embargo, queremos mantener el ULP como lo dan otros parámetros al tiempo que modificamos la distribución de pérdidas para el tráfico de primer plano (FT). Esto equivale a negociar la pérdida de un paquete A +L contra un paquete -1 del mismo flujo (en un sentido estadístico). La figura 10 muestra la curva de probabilidad de caída roja convencional (PO en función del tamaño promedio de la cola para todos los llegados), que se aplica a todo el tráfico (0) sin marcar (tráfico de fondo: BT). La relación necesaria entre las probabilidades de caída para los paquetes marcados como -1 y +L se puede derivar 85 Sigue (tenga en cuenta que esta relación es válida tanto en el nivel de intento final como en cada salto individual): Sea A = A0 +A +, +A-~ Sea el número total de paquetes emitidos por un flujo FT y A ,, + E [-l, O, + L] ser el número de paquetes que pertenecen a una clase determinada (donde la clase 0 corresponde al mejor esfuerzo (sin marcar)traflic). Luego, con a+, = a-1 = a, ~, y considerando que el servicio resultante debe ser el mejor esfuerzo a largo plazo, tenemos: AOPO+A+LP+L+LIP-1 A APE Qlll@+Lfp-1) = (a --o) m p-l = zpo-p +1 (5) Debido a esta relación entre la probabilidad de caída para los paquetes +L y -1, designamos este algoritmo de gestión de colas como rojo diferencial (Dierado). La Figura 10 muestra las curvas de probabilidad de caída correspondientes. Debido a la condición de a +, = (i -l = todos, además del comportamiento rojo convencional, la implementación difede también debe monitorear los procesos de llegada +L y -1. Si la relación de los paquetes de +L a -1 en una puerta de enlace no es 1 (ya sea debido a los flujos de comportamiento mal o un número significativo de flujos que ya han experimentado pérdidas en lúpulos anteriores) la capacidad de pérdida de pérdida -1 disminuye y la probabilidad +Lse incrementa al mismo tiempo degradando así el servicio para todos los usuarios. Las áreas sombreadas por encima y por debajo de la curva PO (AVG) (Fig. 10) muestran el área operativa cuando se agrega esta corrección. En [13] se ha demostrado que usar solo el tamaño de cola promedio rojo convencional AVG para la operación DSred no es suficiente. Esto se debe a la correlación potencialmente faltante del valor AUG calculado entre las llegadas consecutivas de +L y -1, especialmente cuando la participación del Traffic FT es baja. Como esto podría dar lugar a una distribución injusta de pérdidas entre las fracciones FT y BT, se calcula un valor de AVGL específico muestreando el tamaño de la cola solo en los instantes de llegada FT. Por lo tanto, es posible una diferenciación de servicio para el tráfico en primer plano que no difiere del comportamiento rojo convencional en el promedio a largo plazo (es decir, en el ULP).5. Recuperación de pérdida de flujo intra-flujo y control 5.1 Sensibilidad temporal Teniendo en cuenta un flujo con sensibilidad a la pérdida temporal, el párrafo 3.1.1 ha demostrado que un patrón de pérdida periódica simple mejora el rendimiento de la recuperación de pérdida de extremo a extremo. El patrón no está vinculado a paquetes particulares, por lo tanto, es aplicable una caracterización por flujo con las métricas introducidas. En este párrafo suponemos que un flujo expresó su se*sitividad temporal marcando su flujo con un patrón alterno de, c+l,>, c ~ l ,,, 447 Figura 11: Comparación de la Figura 12 real y estimada:Tasas de duración de pérdida de ráfaga reales y estimadas en función de la longitud de explosión de ráfaga, tasas de duración de la pérdida en función de la longitud de explosión K: tres modelos estatales basados en la longitud K: dos modelos estatales basados en la longitud de ejecución (Gilbert) Las Figuras 11 y 12 muestran las tasas para las longitudes de pérdida de ráfaga real y estimada para un modelo de tres estados (M = 2) y dos = estado (M = 1, Gilbert) respectivamente 6. Podemos observar que las formas diferentes de la curva de probabilidad de ráfaga de la manera deseada. La mayor parte de la masa de probabilidad se concentra en pérdidas aisladas (el comportamiento ideal sería la ocurrencia de solo pérdidas aisladas (IC = 1) que se pueden expresar con CLP = 0 en términos de parámetros del modelo Gilbert). Con la cola de caída, se puede obtener una probabilidad de pérdida de ráfaga de aproximadamente geométricamente con el aumento de la longitud de explosión (Ec. 4), donde el parámetro CLP es relativamente grande. Por lo tanto, considerar la voz con la sensibilidad de pérdida temporal como el tráfico de interés en primer plano, con difundido una gran cantidad de ráfagas molestas cortas y molestas se puede negociar contra un mayor número de pérdidas aisladas y pocas explosiones de pérdidas largas (que ocurren cuando la cola está bajo sobrecarga temporal,es decir, AWG> Maxth, Fig. 10). Podemos ver que la estimación del modelo de tres estados (Ec. 2) refleja las dos áreas de la operación difedida (la caída aguda de la tasa de duración de la pérdida de ráfaga para K = 2 y la disminución a lo largo de una asíntota geométricamente decreciente para K> 2). Este efecto no puede ser capturado por el modelo de estado (Ec. 4), lo que sobreestima la tasa de duración de la pérdida de estallido para IC = 2 y luego lo subestima enormemente para K> 2. Curiosamente, para la cola de caída, mientras que ambos modelos capturan la forma de la curva real, el modelo de orden inferior es más preciso en la estimación. Esto se puede explicar de la siguiente manera: si las probabilidades de duración de la pérdida de ráfaga están de hecho cerca de una distribución geométrica, la estimación es más robusta si se incluyen todos los datos (tenga en cuenta que la aproximación basada en la longitud de ejecución de la probabilidad de pérdida condicional P (x =mlx = m) Solo incluye la pérdida de la longitud de ejecución más grandes o iguales a M: Eq. 1).SWE solo discuta los resultados cualitativamente aquí para dar un ejemplo de cómo funciona un algoritmo de control de pérdida de flujo intra-flujo y para mostrar cómo los modelos de pérdida pueden capturar este rendimiento. Los detalles sobre el escenario de simulación y los parámetros se pueden encontrar en [12].5.2 Sensibilidad debido a la heterogeneidad de ADU en el párrafo 3.1.2 Hemos visto que la sensibilidad a la heterogeneidad de ADU da como resultado un cierto patrón de pérdida no periódica. Por lo tanto, es necesario un mecanismo en (o cerca) del remitente que deriva ese patrón de los datos de voz. Además, es necesaria una cooperación explícita entre los mecanismos de extremo a extremo y de lúpulo (Fig. 4). Utilizamos el resultado del párrafo 3.2 para desarrollar un nuevo esquema de marcado de paquetes llamado marcado de paquetes diferenciales selectivos basados en la propiedad del habla (SPB-Diffmark). El esquema Diffmark concentra los paquetes de mayor prioridad en los marcos esenciales para la señal del habla y se basa en la ocultación de los decodificadores para otros cuadros. La Figura 13 muestra el algoritmo simple escrito en un pseudocodo que se utiliza para detectar una transición sin voz/voz (UW) y proteger los marcos con voz en el comienzo de una señal de voz. El análisis del procedimiento0 se utiliza para clasificar un bloque de marcos IC según la voz, sin voz o transición UV.Send0 se usa para enviar un bloque de marcos IC como un solo paquete con la prioridad apropiada (FL, 0 o -1). Como el algoritmo central da solo una decisión de marcado binario (proteger el paquete o no), empleamos un algoritmo simple para enviar los paquetes necesarios -1 para la compensación (Ec. 5): después de que se haya enviado una explosión de paquetes +L, unEl número correspondiente de paquetes -1 se envía inmediatamente. Estado sobre el número necesario de paquetes de -1 -1 se mantiene en caso de que el algoritmo SPB desencadine la siguiente explosión +L antes de que se envíen todos los paquetes necesarios para la compensación. Por lo tanto, vistos en los intervalos de tiempo que son largos en comparación con los tiempos de ráfaga +1/-L, la pérdida media para el flujo será igual al mejor caso de esfuerzo (Eq. 5). N es un valor predefinido y define cuántos cuadros al comienzo de una señal expresada se protegerán. Nuestras simulaciones (Fig. 9) han demostrado que el rango de 10 a 20 son valores apropiados para N (dependiendo de la condición de pérdida de red). En las simulaciones presentadas a continuación, elegimos IC = 2, un 448 448 típico protegido = 0 fcm? Ach (k marcos) clasificar = análisis (k marcos)] if (proteger> 0) if (classify == no aspirado) proteger = 0 si(Compensación> 0) Compensación = Compensación-K Enviar (K Frames, -1) Else Send (K Frames, 0) Endif Else Send (K Frames, +L) Protect = Protect-K Compensation = Compensation +K Endif Else if (Classify == UVFransition) Enviar (K Frames, +L) Protect = N -K Compensación = Compensación +K else if (Compensación> 0) Compensación = Compensación -K Send (K Frames, -1) Else Send (K Frames, 0) Endif Endif Endif EndFor Figura 13: Valor del código de pseudo de SPB-Diffmark para transmisiones de voz interactivas a través de Internet (20 ms de datos de audio por paquete). Un mayor número de IC ayudaría a reducir la sobrecarga relativa del encabezado del protocolo, pero también aumenta el retraso de la paquete y hace que la clasificación del remitente y la ocultación del receptor en caso de pérdida de paquetes (debido a una brecha de pérdida mayor) sea más difícil.5.2.1 Descripción de la simulación en. Por lo tanto, utilizamos un modelo de Markov de un estado separado (modelo Bernouilli) para describir el comportamiento de la red como lo ve cada clase de paquetes. Los paquetes de mejor esfuerzo (designados por 0 en la Fig. 14) se eliminan con la PC de probabilidad, mientras que los paquetes marcados con +L y -1 se eliminan con probabilidades de P +I y P -1 respectivamente. Esta es una suposición razonable con respecto a la interdependencia de las diferentes clases de hecho, ya que se ha demostrado que DiFred (Figs. 11 y 12) logra una buena cantidad de decorrelación de pérdidas de paquetes +L y -1. Sin embargo, para incluir alguna correlación entre las clases, hemos establecido p+i = 10m3 PC para las simulaciones posteriores. Esto en caso de que la idoneidad del modelado simple de extremo a extremo utilizado se haya investigado en [12] con simulación de eventos discretos utilizando una topología múltiple y modelado detallado de fuentes de tráfico en primer plano y fondo.

Para una comparación directa con SPB-Diffmark, evaluamos un esquema donde los paquetes se marcan alternativamente como -1 o +L (Alt-Diffmark, Figura 14). Además, incluimos esquemas relacionados de protección de pérdida entre flujo entre flujo. El primer esquema utiliza protección completa (marca completa, todos los paquetes están marcados como +L). El esquema SPB-Mark opera de manera similar a SPB-Diffmark, pero no se envían paquetes no -1 para compensación (esos paquetes también están marcados como 0). A modo de comparación, usamos nuevamente un esquema donde los paquetes se marcan alternativamente como 0 o +L (marcado ALT). Finalmente, los paquetes de los flujos de puro mejor esfuerzo se eliminan con la probabilidad PO (sin caso de marca en la Fig. 14). Para los esquemas de marcado SPB, el porcentaje de paquetes marcados con +L y -L respectivamente es del 40,4% para el material del habla utilizado. Obtuvimos porcentajes de marcado similares para otras muestras de habla. Los esquemas de marcado alternativo marcan exactamente el 50% de sus paquetes como FL.5.2.2 Resultados La Figura 15 muestra la distorsión perceptiva para los esquemas de marcado que dependen de la PC de probabilidad de caída. El caso desprotegido (sin marca) tiene la mayor distorsión perceptiva y, por lo tanto, la peor calidad del habla*. El esquema de marcado diferencial (SPB-Diffmark) ofrece una calidad del habla significativamente mejor, incluso cuando solo usa un servicio de red que equivale al mejor esfuerzo a largo plazo. Tenga en cuenta que la estrategia de marcado de Diffmark alt no difiere del caso de mejor esfuerzo (lo que confirma el resultado del párrafo 3.1.2). SPB-Diffmark también es incluso mejor que el esquema de marca ALT-Mark entre flujo, especialmente para valores más altos de PE. Estos resultados validan la estrategia de nuestros esquemas de marcado SPB que no marcan igualmente todos los paquetes con una prioridad más alta, sino que protegen un subconjunto de marcos que son esenciales para la calidad del habla. El esquema SPB-FEC ([12]), *También hemos realizado pruebas de escucha informal que confirmaron los resultados utilizando las métricas objetivas.449 Figura 15: Distorsión perceptiva (EMBSD) para los esquemas de marcado y SPB-FEC que utiliza redundancia9 Piggybacked en los paquetes de carga útil principales (RFC 2198, [7]) para proteger un subconjunto de los paquetes, permite una calidad de voz muy buena para la salida de salida paraTasas de pérdida bajas. Sin embargo, debe tenerse en cuenta que la cantidad de datos enviados a través de la red aumenta en un 40,4%. Tenga en cuenta que la simulación supone que este ancho de banda consumido también no contribuye significativamente a la congestión. Esta suposición solo es válida si una pequeña fracción de TRAFHC es la voz ([s]). La curva SPB-FEC es convexa con el aumento de la PO, ya que debido a la creciente correlación de pérdidas, un número creciente de paquetes consecutivos que transportan redundancia se pierden, lo que conduce a pérdidas irrecuperables. La curva para SPB-Diffmark es cóncava, sin embargo, produciendo un mejor rendimiento para PE y 0.22. El esquema de marca ALT-Mark inter-flujo (50% de los paquetes están marcados) mejora la calidad perceptiva. Sin embargo, la distancia auditiva y la distorsión perceptiva del esquema de marca SPB (con 40.4% de todos los paquetes marcados) son significativamente más bajas y muy cercanas a la calidad de la señal decodificada cuando todos los paquetes están marcados (marca completa). Esto también muestra que al proteger todo el flujo solo se obtiene una mejora menor en la calidad perceptiva. Los resultados para el esquema de marca completa también muestran que, si bien la pérdida de algunos de los paquetes +L tiene un impacto medible, el impacto en la calidad perceptual aún puede considerarse muy baja.6. Conclusiones En este artículo hemos caracterizado el comportamiento de un códec basado en la muestra (PCM) y un códec basado en marco (G.729) en presencia de pérdida de paquetes. Luego hemos desarrollado mecanismos de recuperación y control de pérdidas intraflow para aumentar la calidad perceptiva. Si bien hemos probado otros códecs solo informalmente, creemos que nuestros resultados reflejan la diferencia fundamental entre los códecs que codifican la onda del habla, también utilizó el codificador G.729 para la codificación de origen redundante.formar directamente o que se basan en la predicción lineal. Para el ocultamiento de PCM sin pérdidas, hemos encontrado que no exhibe una sensibilidad temporal significativa ni sensibilidad a la heterogeneidad de la carga útil. Sin embargo, con el ocultamiento de pérdidas, la calidad del habla aumenta, pero la cantidad de aumento exhibe una fuerte sensibilidad temporal. Los códecs basados en marco amplifican por un lado el impacto de la pérdida por propagación de errores, aunque por otro lado tales esquemas de codificación ayudan a realizar la ocultación de pérdidas mediante la extrapolación del estado del decodificador. Contrariamente a los códecs basados en muestras, hemos demostrado que el rendimiento de ocultación del decodificador G.729 puede romperse en las transiciones dentro de la señal del habla, sin embargo, mostrando así una fuerte sensibilidad a la heterogeneidad de la carga útil. Hemos introducido brevemente un algoritmo de gestión de colas que puede controlar los patrones de pérdida sin cambiar la cantidad de pérdida y caracterizar su rendimiento para el control de pérdidas de un flujo que exhibe sensibilidad temporal. Luego desarrollamos un nuevo esquema de marcado de paquetes llamado marcado de paquetes diferenciales selectivos basados en la propiedad del habla para una protección eficiente de códecs basados en marco. El esquema SPBDiffmark concentra los paquetes de mayor prioridad en los marcos esenciales para la señal del habla y se basa en el ocultamiento de los decodificadores para otros cuadros. También hemos evaluado el mapeo de un algoritmo de extremo a extremo para la protección entre fletos. Hemos descubierto que el esquema de marcado selectivo funciona casi tan buena como la protección de todo el flujo en un número significativamente menor de paquetes de alta prioridad necesarios. Por lo tanto, los esquemas combinados de extremo a extremo / hopby-hop parecen ser adecuados para redes muy cargadas con una fracción relativamente grande de tráfico de voz. Este es el caso porque no necesitan la adición de redundancia ni retroalimentación (lo que incurriría en datos adicionales y retrasaría la sobrecarga) y, por lo tanto, produce una calidad de voz estable también para tasas de pérdida más altas debido a la ausencia de FEC y pérdida de retroalimentación. Dichos esquemas pueden acomodar mejor los códecs con tasas de bits de salida fijas, que son difíciles de integrar en los esquemas FEC que requieren la adaptación tanto del códec como del generador de redundancia. Además, es útil para códecs adaptativos que se ejecutan en la tasa de bits más baja posible. Evitar la redundancia y la retroalimentación también es interesante en los escenarios de conferencias de multidifusión donde las características de pérdida de extremo a extremo de las diferentes rutas que conducen a los miembros de la sesión son en gran medida diferentes. Nuestro trabajo se ha centrado claramente en vincular modelos simples de extremo a extremo que se pueden parametrizar fácilmente con la característica conocida del control de pérdida de hopby-hop con las métricas a nivel de usuario. Un análisis de un despliegue a gran escala de FEC no adaptativo o adaptativo en comparación con una implementación de nuestro esquema combinado requiere un estudio claramente posterior.7.

        "Thus, the loss of packets impairs the application-level utility.",
        "For voice this utility impairment is twofold: on one hand, even short bursts of lost packets may decrease significantly the ability of the receiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal playout is interrupted.",
        "On the other hand, some packets may be particular sensitive to loss as they carry more important information in terms of user perception than other packets.",
        "We first develop an end-to-end model based on loss runlengths with which we can describe the loss distribution within a flow.",
        "These packet-level metrics are then linked to user-level objective speech quality metrics.",
        "Using this framework, we find that for low-compressing sample-based codecs (PCM) with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be concealed well, whereas burst losses have a higher perceptual impact.",
        "For high-compressing frame-based codecs (G.729) on one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error propagation caused by the decoder filter memories, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state.",
        "Contrary to sample-based codecs we show that the concealment performance may break at transitions within the speech signal however.",
        "We then propose mechanisms which differentiate between packets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of packet loss.",
        "We designate these methods as intra-flow loss recovery and control.",
        "At the end-to-end level, identification of packets sensitive to loss (sender) as well as loss concealment (receiver) takes place.",
        "Hop-by-hop support schemes then allow to (statistically) trade the loss of one packet, which is considered more important, against another one of the same flow which is of lower importance.",
        "As both packets require the same cost in terms of network transmission, a gain in user perception is obtainable.",
        "We show that significant speech quality improvements can be achieved and additional data and delay overhead can be avoided while still maintaining a network service which is virtually identical to best effort in the long term.",

        "INTRODUCTION Considering that a real-time flow may experience some packet loss, the impact of loss may vary significantly dependent on which packets are lost within a flow.",
        "In the following we distinguish two reasons for such a variable loss sensitivity: Temporal sensitivity: Loss of ADUs which is correlated in time may lead to disruptions in the service.",
        "Note that this effect is further aggravated by some interdependence between ADUs (i.e., that one ADU can only be decoded when a previous ADU before has successfully been received and decoded).",
        "For voice, as a single packet contains typically several ADUs (voice frames) this effect is thus more significant than e.g. for video.",
        "It translates basically to isolated packet losses versus losses that occur in bursts.",
        "Sensitivity due to ADU heterogeneity: Certain ADUs might contain parts of the encoded signal which are Application Data Unit: the unit of data emitted by a source coder such as a video or voice frame. 441 Figure 1: Schematic utility functions dependent on the loss of more (+l) and less (-1) important packets more important with regard to user perception than others of the same flow.",
        "Let us consider a flow with two frame types of largely different perceptual importance (we assume same size, frequency and no interdependence between the frames).",
        "Under the loss of 50% of the packets, the perceptual quality varies hugely between the case where the 50% of the frames with high perceptual importance are received and the tax where the 50% less important frames are received.",
        "Network support for real-time multimedia flows can on one hand aim at offering a lossless service, which, however, to be implemented within a pa&et-switched network, will be costly for the network provider and thus for the user.",
        "On the other hand, within a lossy service, the above sensitivity constraints must be taken into account.",
        "It is our strong belief that this needs to be done in a generic way, i.e., no application-specific knowledge (about particular coding schemes e.g.) should be necessary within the network and, vice versa, no knowledge about network specifics should be necessary within an application.",
        "Let us now consider the case that 50% of packets of a flow are identified as more important (designated by +l) or less important (-1) due to any of the above sensitivity constraints.",
        "Figure 1 a) shows a generic utility function describing the applicationlevel Quality of Service (QoS) dependent on the percentage of packets lost.",
        "For real-time multimedia traffic, such utility should correspond to perceived video/voice quality.",
        "If the relative importance of the packets is not known by the transmission system, the loss rates for the +l and -1 packets are equal.",
        "Due to the over-proportional sensitivity of the +l packets to loss as well as the dependence of the end-t* end loss recovery performance on the fl packets, the utility function is decreasing significantly in a non-linear way (approximated in the figure by piece-wise linear functions) with an increasing loss rate.",
        "Figure 1 b) presents the CBS~ where all +l packets are protected at the expense of -1 pa&&.",
        "The decay of the utility function (for loss rates < 50%) is reduced, because the +l packets are protected and the endto-end loss recovery can thus operate properly over a wider range of loss rates indicated by the shaded area.",
        "This results in a graceful degradation of the applications utility.",
        "Note that the higher the non-linearity of the utility contribution of the fl packets is (deviation from the dotted curve in Fig. 1 a), the higher is the potential gain in utility when the protection for +l packets is enabled.",
        "Results for actual perceived quality as utility for multimedia applications exhibit such a non-linear behavior*.",
        "To describe this effect and provide a taxonomy for different QoS enhancement approaches, we introduce a novel terminology: we designate mechanisms which influence QoS parameters between Bows (thus decrease the loss rate of one flow at the expense of other flows) as inter-flow QoS.",
        "Schemes which, in the presence of loss, differentiate between pa&& within a flow as demonstrated in Figure 1 above, provide intra-flow QoS enhancement.",
        "As QoS mechanisms have to be implemented within the network (hopby-hop) and/or in the end systems (end-to-end), we have another axis of classification.",
        "The adaptation of the senders bitrate to the current network congestion state as an intraflow QoS scheme (loss avoidance, [IS]) is difficult to apply to voice.",
        "Considering that voice flows have a very low bitrate, the relative cost of transmitting the feedback information is high (when compared e.g. to a video flow).",
        "To reduce this cost the feedback interval would need to be increased, then leading to a higher probability of wrong adaptation decisions.",
        "The major di6culty, however, is the lack of a codec which is truly scalable in terms of its output bitrate and corresponding perceptual quality.",
        "Currently standardized voice codecs ([17]) usually only have a 6xed output bitrate.",
        "While it has been proposed to switch between voice codeca ([2]), the MOS (subjective quality) values for the codecs employed do not differ much: e.g., theITU codecs G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726and G.711 cover a bitrate range from 5.3 kbitjs to 64 kbitjs while the subjective quality differs by less than 0.25 on a l-to-5 MOS scale ([4], 1: bad, 5: excellent quality).",
        "So when the availability of sutticient computing power is assumed, the lowest bitrate codec can be chosen permanently without actually decreasing the perceptual quality.",
        "For loss recovery on an end-to-end basis, due to the realtime delay constraints, open-loop schemes like Forward Error Correction (FEC) have been proposed ([2]).",
        "While such schemes are attractive because they can be used on the Internet today, they also have several drawbacks.",
        "The amount of redundant information needs to be adaptive to avoid taking bandwidth away from other flows.",
        "This adaptation is crucial especially when the fraction of traflic using redundancy schemes is large (181).",
        "If the redundancy is a source coding itself, like it has often been proposed ([7]), the comments from above on adaptation also apply.",
        "Using redundancy has also implications to the playout delay adaptation ([lo]) employed to de-jitter the packets at the receiver.",
        "Note that the presented types of loss sensitivity also apply to apWhile we have obtained results which confirm the shape of the overall utility curve shown in Fig. 1, clearly the utility functions of the +1/-l sub.flows and their relationship are more complex and only approximately additive. 442 Table 1: State and transition probabilities computed for an end-to-end Internet trace using a general Markov model (third order) by Yajnik et. al.

        "We employ these metrics to describe the sensitivity of VoIP traffic to packet loss in section 3.",
        "Section 4 briefly introduces a queue management algorithm which can be used for intra-flow loss control.",
        "In section 5, we present results documenting the performance of the proposed mechanisms at both the end-to-end and hopby-hop level.",
        "Section 6 concludes the paper. 2.",
        "METRICS 2.1 Packet-level metrics A general Markov model ([19, S]) which describes the loss process is defined as follows: Let P( Z(s) ] Z(s - m),... ,Z(s - 2),Z(s - 1) ) be the state transition probability of a general Markov model of order m, where Z(s) is the loss indicator function for the packet with the sequence number s. All combinations for the values (0 and 1) of the sequence Z(s-m), . . . , Z(s-2),Z(s-1) appear in the state space.",
        "As an example P( Z(s) = 1 ] Z(s - 2),Z(s1) = 01 ) gives the state transition probability when the current packet s is lost, the previous packet s - 1 has also been lost and packet s - 2 has not been lost.",
        "The number of states of the model is 2.",
        "Two state transitions can take place from any of the states.",
        "Thus, the number of parameters which have to be computed is 2m+1.",
        "Even for relatively small m this amount of parameters is difficult to be evaluated and compared.",
        "Table 1 shows some values for the state and transition probabilities for a general Markov model of third order measured end-to-end in the Internet by Yajnik et. al. ([19]).",
        "It is interesting to note that for all states with Z(s - 1) = 0 the probability for the next packet not to be lost (Z(s) = 0) is generally very high (> 0.8, in bold typeface) whereas when Z(s- 1) = 1 the state transition probabilities to that event cover the range of 0.15 to 0.61.",
        "That means that past no loss events do not affect the loss process as much as past loss events.",
        "Intuitively this seems to make sense, because a successfully arriving packet can be seen as a indicator for congestion relief.",
        "Andren et. al. ([l]) as well as Yajnik et. al. ([20]) both confirmed this by measuring the cross correlation of the loss- and no-loss-runlengths.",
        "They came to the result that such correlation is very weak.",
        "This implies that patterns of short loss bursts interspersed with short periods of successful packet arrivals occur rarely (note in this context that in &able 1 the pattern 101 has by far the lowest state probability).",
        "Thus, in the following we employ a model ([12]) which only considers the past loss events for the state transition probability.",
        "The number of states of the model can be reduced from 2m to m + 1.",
        "This means that we only consider the state transition probability P( Z(s) ] Z(s - k), . . . ,Z(s - 1) ) with Z(s - Ic + i) = 1 V i E [0, Ic - 11, where Ic (0 < k 5 m) is a variable parameter.",
        "We define a loss run length lc for a sequence of Ic consecutively lost packets detected at sj (sj > Ic > 0) with Z(sj - k - 1) = O,Z(sj) = 0 and Z(sj - k + i) = 1 V i E [0, Ic - 11, j being the j-th <burst loss event.",
        "Note that the parameters of the model become independent of the sequence number s and can now rather be described by the occurence ok of a loss run length k. We define the random variable X as follows: X = 0: no packet lost, X = k (0 < lc < m): ezactly lc consecutive packets lost, and X 2 k (0 < k < m): at least k consecutive packets lost.",
        "With this definition, we establish a loss run-length model with a finite number of states (m + 1) which gives loss probabilities dependent on the burst length.",
        "In the model, for every additional lost packet which adds to the length of a loss burst a state transition takes place.",
        "If a packet is successfully received, the state returns to X = 0.",
        "Thus, the state probability of the system for 0 < Ic < m is P(X 2 Zc).",
        "Due to the limited memory of the system, the last state X = m is just defined as crm consecutive packets lost, with P(X = m) being the state probability.",
        "Given the case of a finite number of packets a for a flow, which experiences d = cpC1 ]cok packet drops, we have the relative frequency pL,k = 2 (P(X = k) for a + 00) for the occurence of a loss burst of length lc.",
        "An approximation for the expectation of the random variable X can be computed as pi = cr==, #+L,k and identified with the mean loss rate.",
        "We can also approximate the state probabilities of the model by the cumulative loss rate p~,~,,~(k) = CrSkp~,,, (0 < k < m) and p~,~ = Cr.p=, (n--mzl)ot (k = m).",
        "The transition probabilities for 1 < lc < m can be computed easily as: p(k--l)(k) = P(X>klX>k-l)= P(X>knX>k-1) P(X>k-1) ZZ P ( X > k ) P(X>k-1) These conditional loss probabilities again can be approxPzl,cum(k) _ Cnm,k on i m a t e d by PL,cond@) = PL,cum(k-l) - C;Ek--l 0,.",
        "For 443 Figure 2: Loss run-length model with m + 1 states P(X = m]X = m) we have: PL,,,d(rn) = %Lf;:P Fig. 2 shows the Markov chain for the model. (1) Additionally, we also define a random variable Y which de scribes the distribution of burst loss lengths with respect to the bunt loss events j (and not to packet events like in the definition of X).",
        "We have the burst loss length rate ga = * as an estimate for P(Y = k).",
        "Thus, the mean burst loss length is g = h = e = CT==, kgb corresponding to E[Y] (average loss gap, [5]).",
        "The run-length model implies a geometric distribution for residing in state X = m. For the probability of a burst loss length of k packets we thus can compute estimates for performance parameters in a higher order model representation (note that here Y represent the random variable used in the higher-order models).",
        "For a three state model we have e.g. for P(Y = k): P(Y = k) = P(Y=k)=l-pm: k=l pn p;; (1 -pm): k 2 2 c-4 For the special case of a system with a memory of only the previous packet (m = l), we can use the runlength distribution for a simple computation of the parameters of the commonly-used Gilbert model (Fig. 3) to characterize the loss process (X being the associated random variable with X = 0: no packet lost, X = 1 a packet lost).",
        "Then the probability of being in state m can be seen BS the uncow ditional loss probability ulp and approximated by the mean loss (pr. = pi,,,,).",
        "Only one conditional loss probability clp for the transition 1 --t 1 exists: p~,E-d = CFL(~ - lbd (3) If losses of one flow are correlated (i.e., the loss probability of an arriving packet is itiuenced by the contribution to the state of the queue by a previous packet of the same flow and/or both the previous and the current packet see busty arrivals of other traffic, [15]) we have pal < clp and thus ulp 5 clp.",

        "Both metrics are distance measures, i.e., a IB suit value of 0 implies perfect quality, the larger the value, the worse the speech quality is (in Fig. 5 we show an axis with approximate corresponding MOS values).",

        "Together with the parameters of the network model (section 2.1) and the perceptual model we obtain a measurement setup which allows us to map a specific PCM signal input to a speech quality measure.",
        "While using a simple end-to-end loss characterization, we generate a large number of loss patterns by using different seeds for the pseudcerandom number generator (for the results presented here we used 300 patterns for each simulated condition for a single speech sample).",
        "This procedure takes thus into account that the impact of loss on an input signal may not be homogenous (i.e., a loss burst within one segment of that signal can have a different perceptual impact than a loss burst of the same size within another segment).",
        "By averaging the result of the objective quality measure for several loss patterns, we have a reliable indication for the performance of the codec operating under a certain network loss condition.",

        "When a frame loss occurs, the decoder cannot update its state, resulting in a divergence of encoder and decoder state.",
        "Thus, errors are not only introduced during the time period represented by the current frame but also in the following ones.",

        "We can see from Figure 9 that the position of a frame loss has a signilicant inlluence cm the resulting signal degradation, while the degradation is not that sensitive to the length of the frame loss burst k. The loss of unvoiced frames seems to have a rather small impact on the signal degradation and the decoder recovers the state information fast thereafter.",

        "We have repeated the experiment for different male and female speakers and obtained similar results. lsking into account the wed coding scheme, the above phenomenon could be explained as follows: Because voiced sounds have a higher energy than unvoiced sounds, the loss of voiced frames causes a larger signal degradation than the loss of unvoiced frames.",
        "However, due to the periodic property of voiced sounds, the decoder can conceal While on one hand we see that SNR n~easu~es often do not correlate well with subjective speech quality, on the other hand the large differences in the SNR-threshold-based resynchronization time clearly point to a significant impact on subjective speech quality. 446 Figure 10: Differential RED drop probabilities as a function of average queue sizes the loss of voiced frames well once it has obtained suflicient information on them.",
        "The decoder fails to conceal the loss of voiced frames at an unvoiced/voiced transition because it attempts to conceal the loss of voiced frames using the filter coefficients and the excitation for an unvoiced sound.",
        "Moreover, because the G.729 encoder uses a moving average filter to predict the values of the line spectral pairs and only transmits the difference between the real and predicted vaues, it takes a lot of time for the decoder to resynchronize with the encoder once it has failed to build the appropriate linear prediction filter. 4.",
        "QUEUE MANAGEMENT FOR INTRAFLOW LOSS CONTROL While we have highlighted the sensitivity of VoIP traffic to the distribution of loss in the last sections, we now want to briefly introduce a queue management mechanism ([13]) which is able to enforce the relative preferences of the ap plication with regard to loss.",

        "As it should be avoided to introduce reordering of the packets of a flow in the network we consider mechanisms for the management of a single queue with different priority levels.",
        "One approach to realize inter-flow service differentiation using a single queue is RIO (RED with IN and OUT, [3]).",
        "With RIO, two average queue sizes as congestion indicators are computed: one just for the IN (high priority) packets and another for both IN and OUT (low priority) packets.",
        "Packets marked as OUT are dropped earlier (in terms of the average queue size) than IN packets.",
        "RIO has been designed to decrease the clip seen by particular Bows at the expense of other flows.",
        "In this work, however, we want to keep the ulp as given by other parameters while modifying the loss distribution for the foreground traffic (FT).",
        "This amounts to trading the loss of a +l packet against a -1 packet of the same flow (in a statistical sense).",
        "Fig. 10 shows the conventional RED drop probability curve (po as a function of the average queue size for all arrivals avg), which is applied to all unmarked (0) traffic (background traffic: BT).",
        "The necessary relationship between the drop probabilities for packets marked as -1 and +l can be derived 85 follows (note that this relationship is valid both at the end-tend level and every individual hop): Let a = a0 + a+, +a-~ be the overall number of emitted packets by an FT flow and a,, + E [-l,O, +l] be the number of packets belonging to a certain class (where the 0 class corresponds to (unmarked) best effort traflic).",

        "Due to the condition of a+, = (I-L = all, in addition to the conventional RED behaviour, the DiffRED implementation should also monitor the +l and -1 arrival processes.",
        "If the ratio of +l to -1 packets at a gateway is not 1 (either due to misbehaving flows or a significant number of flows which have already experienced loss at earlier hops) the -1 loss prob ability is decreased and the +l probability is increased at the same time thus degrading the service for all users.",
        "The shaded areas above and below the po(avg) curve (Fig. 10) show the operating area when this correction is added.",
        "In [13] it has been shown that using only the conventional RED average queue size avg for DSRED operation is not sufficient.",
        "This is due to the potentially missing correlation of the computed aug value between consecutive +l and -1 arrivals, especially when the share of the FT traftic is low.",
        "As this might result in a unfair distribution of losses between the FT and BT fractions, a specific avgl value is computed by sampling the queue size only at FT arrival instants.",

        "Figures 11 and 12 show the rates for the actual and the estimated burst loss lengths for a three-state (m = 2) and a two=state (m = 1, Gilbert) model respectively6.",
        "We can observe that DiffRED shapes the burst probability curve in the desired way.",
        "Most of the probability mass is concentrated at, isolated losses (the ideal behaviour would be the occurence of only isolated losses (Ic = 1) which can be expressed with clp = 0 in terms of Gilbert model parameters).",
        "With Drop Tail an approximately geometrically decreasing burst loss probability with increasing burst length (Eq. 4) is obtainable, where the clp parameter is relatively large though.",
        "Thus, considering voice with temporal loss sensitivity as the foreground traffic of interest, with DifFRED a large number of short annoying bursts can be traded against a larger number of isolated losses and few long loss bursts (which occur when the queue is under temporary overload, i.e., awg > maxth, Fig. 10).",
        "We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2).",
        "This effect cannot be captured by the two state model (Eq. 4) which thus overestimates the burst loss length rate for Ic = 2 and then hugely underestimates it for k > 2.",
        "Interestingly, for Drop Tail, while both models capture the shape of the actual curve, the lower order model is more accurate in the estimation.",
        "This can be explained as follows: if the burst loss length probabilities are in fact close to a geometrical distribution, the estimate is more robust if all data is included (note that the run-length based approximation of the conditional loss probability P(X = mlX = m) only includes loss run-length occurences larger or equal to m: Eq. 1). sWe only discuss the results qualitatively here to give an example how an intra-flow loss control algorithm performs and to show how loss models can capture this performance.",
        "Details on the simulation scenario and parameters can be found in [12]. 5.2 Sensitivity due to ADU heterogeneity In paragraph 3.1.2 we have seen that sensitivity to ADU heterogeneity results in a certain non-periodic loss pattern.",
        "Thus, a mechanism at (or near) the sender is necessary which derives that pattern from the voice data.",
        "Furthermore, an explicit cooperation between end-to-end and hop by-hop mechanisms is necessary (Fig. 4).",

        "The procedure analysis0 is used to classify a block of Ic frames as voiced, unvoiced, or uv transition. send0 is used to send a block of Ic frames as a single packet with the appropriate priority (either fl, 0 or -1).",
        "As the core algorithm gives only a binary marking decision (protect the packet or not), we employ a simple algorithm to send the necessary -1 packets for compensation (Eq. 5): after a burst of +l packets has been sent, a corresponding number of -1 packets is sent immediately.",
        "State about the necessary number of to-be-sent -1 packets is kept in the event that the SPB algorithm triggers the next +l burst before all -1 packets necessary for compensation are sent.",
        "Thus, seen over time intervals which are long compared to the +1/-l burst times, the mean loss for the flow will be equal to the best effort case (Eq. 5).",
        "N is a pre-defined value and defines how many frames at the beginning of a voiced signal are to be protected.",
        "Our simulations (Fig. 9) have shown that the range from 10 to 20 are appropriate values for N (depending on the network loss condition).",

        "For PCM without loss concealment we have found that it neither exhibits significant temporal sensitivity nor sensitivity to payload heterogeneity.",
        "With loss concealment, however, the speech quality is increased but the amount of increase exhibits strong temporal sensitivity.",
        "Frame-based codecs amplify on one hand the impact of loss by error propagation, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state.",
        "Contrary to sample-based codecs we have shown that the concealment performance of the G.729 decoder may break at transitions within the speech signal however, thus showing strong sensitivity to payload heterogeneity.",
        "We have briefly introduced a queue management algorithm which is able to control loss patterns without changing the amount of loss and characterized its performance for the loss control of a flow exhibiting temporal sensitivity.",
        "Then we developed a new packet marking scheme called Speech Property-Based Selective Differential Packet Marking for an efficient protection of frame-based codecs.",
        "The SPBDIFFMARK scheme concentrates the higher priority packets on the frames essential to the speech signal and relies on the decoders concealment for other frames.",
        "We have also evaluated the mapping of an end-to-end algorithm to interflow protection.",
        "We have found that the selective marking scheme performs almost as good as the protection of the entire flow at a significantly lower number of necessary highpriority packets.",
        "Thus, combined intra-flow end-to-end / hopby-hop schemes seem to be well-suited for heavily-loaded networks with a relatively large fraction of voice traffic.",
        "This is the case because they neither need the addition of redundancy nor feedback (which would incur additional data and delay overhead) and thus yield stable voice quality also for higher loss rates due to absence of FEC and feedback loss.",
        "Such schemes can better accomodate codecs with fixed output bitrates, which are difficult to integrate into FEC schemes requiring adaptivity of both the codec and the redundancy generator.",
        "Also, it is useful for adaptive codecs running at the lowest possible bitrate.",
        "Avoiding redundancy and feedback is also interesting in multicast conferencing scenarios where the end-to-end loss characteristics of the different paths leading to members of the session are largely different.",
        "Our work has clearly focused on linking simple end-to-end models which can be easily parametrized with the known characteristic of hopby-hop loss control to user-level metrics.",

                "The decay of the utility function (for loss rates < 50%) is reduced, because the +l packets are protected and the endto-end loss recovery can thus operate properly over a wider range of loss rates indicated by the shaded area.",

                "While it has been proposed to switch between voice codeca ([2]), the MOS (subjective quality) values for the codecs employed do not differ much: e.g., theITU codecs G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726and G.711 cover a bitrate range from 5.3 kbitjs to 64 kbitjs while the subjective quality differs by less than 0.25 on a l-to-5 MOS scale ([4], 1: bad, 5: excellent quality).",

All combinations for the values (0 and 1) of the sequence Z(s-m), . . . , Z(s-2),Z(s-1) appear in the state space.",

                "That means that past no loss events do not affect the loss process as much as past loss events.",
                "Intuitively this seems to make sense, because a successfully arriving packet can be seen as a indicator for congestion relief.",
                "Andren et. al. ([l]) as well as Yajnik et. al. ([20]) both confirmed this by measuring the cross correlation of the loss- and no-loss-runlengths.",
                "They came to the result that such correlation is very weak.",
                "This implies that patterns of short loss bursts interspersed with short periods of successful packet arrivals occur rarely (note in this context that in &able 1 the pattern 101 has by far the lowest state probability).",

                "We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2).",

                "That means that past no loss events do not affect the loss process as much as past loss events.",

                "The major di6culty, however, is the lack of a codec which is truly scalable in terms of its output bitrate and corresponding perceptual quality.",
                "Currently standardized voice codecs ([17]) usually only have a 6xed output bitrate.",
                "While it has been proposed to switch between voice codeca ([2]), the MOS (subjective quality) values for the codecs employed do not differ much: e.g., theITU codecs G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726and G.711 cover a bitrate range from 5.3 kbitjs to 64 kbitjs while the subjective quality differs by less than 0.25 on a l-to-5 MOS scale ([4], 1: bad, 5: excellent quality).",

                "This implies that patterns of short loss bursts interspersed with short periods of successful packet arrivals occur rarely (note in this context that in &able 1 the pattern 101 has by far the lowest state probability).",

                "We can observe that DiffRED shapes the burst probability curve in the desired way.",
                "Most of the probability mass is concentrated at, isolated losses (the ideal behaviour would be the occurence of only isolated losses (Ic = 1) which can be expressed with clp = 0 in terms of Gilbert model parameters).",
                "With Drop Tail an approximately geometrically decreasing burst loss probability with increasing burst length (Eq. 4) is obtainable, where the clp parameter is relatively large though.",
                "Thus, considering voice with temporal loss sensitivity as the foreground traffic of interest, with DifFRED a large number of short annoying bursts can be traded against a larger number of isolated losses and few long loss bursts (which occur when the queue is under temporary overload, i.e., awg > maxth, Fig. 10).",
                "We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2).",
                "This effect cannot be captured by the two state model (Eq. 4) which thus overestimates the burst loss length rate for Ic = 2 and then hugely underestimates it for k > 2.",

                "This can be explained as follows: if the burst loss length probabilities are in fact close to a geometrical distribution, the estimate is more robust if all data is included (note that the run-length based approximation of the conditional loss probability P(X = mlX = m) only includes loss run-length occurences larger or equal to m: Eq. 1). sWe only discuss the results qualitatively here to give an example how an intra-flow loss control algorithm performs and to show how loss models can capture this performance.",

                "We can see from Figure 9 that the position of a frame loss has a signilicant inlluence cm the resulting signal degradation, while the degradation is not that sensitive to the length of the frame loss burst k. The loss of unvoiced frames seems to have a rather small impact on the signal degradation and the decoder recovers the state information fast thereafter.",

                "We have repeated the experiment for different male and female speakers and obtained similar results. lsking into account the wed coding scheme, the above phenomenon could be explained as follows: Because voiced sounds have a higher energy than unvoiced sounds, the loss of voiced frames causes a larger signal degradation than the loss of unvoiced frames.",
                "However, due to the periodic property of voiced sounds, the decoder can conceal While on one hand we see that SNR n~easu~es often do not correlate well with subjective speech quality, on the other hand the large differences in the SNR-threshold-based resynchronization time clearly point to a significant impact on subjective speech quality. 446 Figure 10: Differential RED drop probabilities as a function of average queue sizes the loss of voiced frames well once it has obtained suflicient information on them.",

                "We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2).",

                "Contrary to sample-based codecs we show that the concealment performance may break at transitions within the speech signal however.",

                "The decay of the utility function (for loss rates < 50%) is reduced, because the +l packets are protected and the endto-end loss recovery can thus operate properly over a wider range of loss rates indicated by the shaded area.",

                "Note that the higher the non-linearity of the utility contribution of the fl packets is (deviation from the dotted curve in Fig. 1 a), the higher is the potential gain in utility when the protection for +l packets is enabled.",

                "To reduce this cost the feedback interval would need to be increased, then leading to a higher probability of wrong adaptation decisions.",
                "The major di6culty, however, is the lack of a codec which is truly scalable in terms of its output bitrate and corresponding perceptual quality.",
                "Currently standardized voice codecs ([17]) usually only have a 6xed output bitrate.",
                "While it has been proposed to switch between voice codeca ([2]), the MOS (subjective quality) values for the codecs employed do not differ much: e.g., theITU codecs G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726and G.711 cover a bitrate range from 5.3 kbitjs to 64 kbitjs while the subjective quality differs by less than 0.25 on a l-to-5 MOS scale ([4], 1: bad, 5: excellent quality).",

All combinations for the values (0 and 1) of the sequence Z(s-m), . . . , Z(s-2),Z(s-1) appear in the state space.",
                "As an example P( Z(s) = 1 ] Z(s - 2),Z(s1) = 01 ) gives the state transition probability when the current packet s is lost, the previous packet s - 1 has also been lost and packet s - 2 has not been lost.",

                "It is interesting to note that for all states with Z(s - 1) = 0 the probability for the next packet not to be lost (Z(s) = 0) is generally very high (> 0.8, in bold typeface) whereas when Z(s- 1) = 1 the state transition probabilities to that event cover the range of 0.15 to 0.61.",
                "That means that past no loss events do not affect the loss process as much as past loss events.",
                "Intuitively this seems to make sense, because a successfully arriving packet can be seen as a indicator for congestion relief.",
                "Andren et. al. ([l]) as well as Yajnik et. al. ([20]) both confirmed this by measuring the cross correlation of the loss- and no-loss-runlengths.",
                "They came to the result that such correlation is very weak.",
                "This implies that patterns of short loss bursts interspersed with short periods of successful packet arrivals occur rarely (note in this context that in &able 1 the pattern 101 has by far the lowest state probability).",

                "We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2).",

                "Thus, the loss of packets impairs the application-level utility.",
                "For voice this utility impairment is twofold: on one hand, even short bursts of lost packets may decrease significantly the ability of the receiver to conceal the packet loss and the speech signal playout is interrupted.",

                "Using this framework, we find that for low-compressing sample-based codecs (PCM) with loss concealment isolated packet losses can be concealed well, whereas burst losses have a higher perceptual impact.",
                "For high-compressing frame-based codecs (G.729) on one hand the impact of loss is amplified through error propagation caused by the decoder filter memories, though on the other hand such coding schemes help to perform loss concealment by extrapolation of decoder state.",
                "Contrary to sample-based codecs we show that the concealment performance may break at transitions within the speech signal however.",
                "We then propose mechanisms which differentiate between packets within a voice data flow to minimize the impact of packet loss.",

                "Note that this effect is further aggravated by some interdependence between ADUs (i.e., that one ADU can only be decoded when a previous ADU before has successfully been received and decoded).",
                "For voice, as a single packet contains typically several ADUs (voice frames) this effect is thus more significant than e.g. for video.",
                "It translates basically to isolated packet losses versus losses that occur in bursts.",

                "Let us consider a flow with two frame types of largely different perceptual importance (we assume same size, frequency and no interdependence between the frames).",
                "Under the loss of 50% of the packets, the perceptual quality varies hugely between the case where the 50% of the frames with high perceptual importance are received and the tax where the 50% less important frames are received.",
                "Network support for real-time multimedia flows can on one hand aim at offering a lossless service, which, however, to be implemented within a pa&et-switched network, will be costly for the network provider and thus for the user.",
                "On the other hand, within a lossy service, the above sensitivity constraints must be taken into account.",
                "It is our strong belief that this needs to be done in a generic way, i.e., no application-specific knowledge (about particular coding schemes e.g.) should be necessary within the network and, vice versa, no knowledge about network specifics should be necessary within an application.",
                "Let us now consider the case that 50% of packets of a flow are identified as more important (designated by +l) or less important (-1) due to any of the above sensitivity constraints.",

                "For real-time multimedia traffic, such utility should correspond to perceived video/voice quality.",
                "If the relative importance of the packets is not known by the transmission system, the loss rates for the +l and -1 packets are equal.",
                "Due to the over-proportional sensitivity of the +l packets to loss as well as the dependence of the end-t* end loss recovery performance on the fl packets, the utility function is decreasing significantly in a non-linear way (approximated in the figure by piece-wise linear functions) with an increasing loss rate.",
                "Figure 1 b) presents the CBS~ where all +l packets are protected at the expense of -1 pa&&.",
                "The decay of the utility function (for loss rates < 50%) is reduced, because the +l packets are protected and the endto-end loss recovery can thus operate properly over a wider range of loss rates indicated by the shaded area.",
                "This results in a graceful degradation of the applications utility.",
                "Note that the higher the non-linearity of the utility contribution of the fl packets is (deviation from the dotted curve in Fig. 1 a), the higher is the potential gain in utility when the protection for +l packets is enabled.",
                "Results for actual perceived quality as utility for multimedia applications exhibit such a non-linear behavior*.",
                "To describe this effect and provide a taxonomy for different QoS enhancement approaches, we introduce a novel terminology: we designate mechanisms which influence QoS parameters between Bows (thus decrease the loss rate of one flow at the expense of other flows) as inter-flow QoS.",
                "Schemes which, in the presence of loss, differentiate between pa&& within a flow as demonstrated in Figure 1 above, provide intra-flow QoS enhancement.",
                "As QoS mechanisms have to be implemented within the network (hopby-hop) and/or in the end systems (end-to-end), we have another axis of classification.",
                "The adaptation of the senders bitrate to the current network congestion state as an intraflow QoS scheme (loss avoidance, [IS]) is difficult to apply to voice.",
                "Considering that voice flows have a very low bitrate, the relative cost of transmitting the feedback information is high (when compared e.g. to a video flow).",
                "To reduce this cost the feedback interval would need to be increased, then leading to a higher probability of wrong adaptation decisions.",
                "The major di6culty, however, is the lack of a codec which is truly scalable in terms of its output bitrate and corresponding perceptual quality.",
                "Currently standardized voice codecs ([17]) usually only have a 6xed output bitrate.",
                "While it has been proposed to switch between voice codeca ([2]), the MOS (subjective quality) values for the codecs employed do not differ much: e.g., theITU codecs G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726and G.711 cover a bitrate range from 5.3 kbitjs to 64 kbitjs while the subjective quality differs by less than 0.25 on a l-to-5 MOS scale ([4], 1: bad, 5: excellent quality).",
                "So when the availability of sutticient computing power is assumed, the lowest bitrate codec can be chosen permanently without actually decreasing the perceptual quality.",
                "For loss recovery on an end-to-end basis, due to the realtime delay constraints, open-loop schemes like Forward Error Correction (FEC) have been proposed ([2]).",
                "While such schemes are attractive because they can be used on the Internet today, they also have several drawbacks.",
                "The amount of redundant information needs to be adaptive to avoid taking bandwidth away from other flows.",
                "This adaptation is crucial especially when the fraction of traflic using redundancy schemes is large (181).",
                "If the redundancy is a source coding itself, like it has often been proposed ([7]), the comments from above on adaptation also apply.",
                "Using redundancy has also implications to the playout delay adaptation ([lo]) employed to de-jitter the packets at the receiver.",
                "Note that the presented types of loss sensitivity also apply to apWhile we have obtained results which confirm the shape of the overall utility curve shown in Fig. 1, clearly the utility functions of the +1/-l sub.flows and their relationship are more complex and only approximately additive. 442 Table 1: State and transition probabilities computed for an end-to-end Internet trace using a general Markov model (third order) by Yajnik et. al.

All combinations for the values (0 and 1) of the sequence Z(s-m), . . . , Z(s-2),Z(s-1) appear in the state space.",
                "As an example P( Z(s) = 1 ] Z(s - 2),Z(s1) = 01 ) gives the state transition probability when the current packet s is lost, the previous packet s - 1 has also been lost and packet s - 2 has not been lost.",

                "It is interesting to note that for all states with Z(s - 1) = 0 the probability for the next packet not to be lost (Z(s) = 0) is generally very high (> 0.8, in bold typeface) whereas when Z(s- 1) = 1 the state transition probabilities to that event cover the range of 0.15 to 0.61.",
                "That means that past no loss events do not affect the loss process as much as past loss events.",
                "Intuitively this seems to make sense, because a successfully arriving packet can be seen as a indicator for congestion relief.",
                "Andren et. al. ([l]) as well as Yajnik et. al. ([20]) both confirmed this by measuring the cross correlation of the loss- and no-loss-runlengths.",
                "They came to the result that such correlation is very weak.",
                "This implies that patterns of short loss bursts interspersed with short periods of successful packet arrivals occur rarely (note in this context that in &able 1 the pattern 101 has by far the lowest state probability).",

                "Both metrics are distance measures, i.e., a IB suit value of 0 implies perfect quality, the larger the value, the worse the speech quality is (in Fig. 5 we show an axis with approximate corresponding MOS values).",

                "Network support for real-time multimedia flows can on one hand aim at offering a lossless service, which, however, to be implemented within a pa&et-switched network, will be costly for the network provider and thus for the user.",

                "Due to the over-proportional sensitivity of the +l packets to loss as well as the dependence of the end-t* end loss recovery performance on the fl packets, the utility function is decreasing significantly in a non-linear way (approximated in the figure by piece-wise linear functions) with an increasing loss rate.",

                "The decay of the utility function (for loss rates < 50%) is reduced, because the +l packets are protected and the endto-end loss recovery can thus operate properly over a wider range of loss rates indicated by the shaded area.",
                "This results in a graceful degradation of the applications utility.",
                "Note that the higher the non-linearity of the utility contribution of the fl packets is (deviation from the dotted curve in Fig. 1 a), the higher is the potential gain in utility when the protection for +l packets is enabled.",

                "Schemes which, in the presence of loss, differentiate between pa&& within a flow as demonstrated in Figure 1 above, provide intra-flow QoS enhancement.",

                "To reduce this cost the feedback interval would need to be increased, then leading to a higher probability of wrong adaptation decisions.",
                "The major di6culty, however, is the lack of a codec which is truly scalable in terms of its output bitrate and corresponding perceptual quality.",
                "Currently standardized voice codecs ([17]) usually only have a 6xed output bitrate.",
                "While it has been proposed to switch between voice codeca ([2]), the MOS (subjective quality) values for the codecs employed do not differ much: e.g., theITU codecs G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726and G.711 cover a bitrate range from 5.3 kbitjs to 64 kbitjs while the subjective quality differs by less than 0.25 on a l-to-5 MOS scale ([4], 1: bad, 5: excellent quality).",

                "That means that past no loss events do not affect the loss process as much as past loss events.",

                "Most of the probability mass is concentrated at, isolated losses (the ideal behaviour would be the occurence of only isolated losses (Ic = 1) which can be expressed with clp = 0 in terms of Gilbert model parameters).",
                "With Drop Tail an approximately geometrically decreasing burst loss probability with increasing burst length (Eq. 4) is obtainable, where the clp parameter is relatively large though.",
                "Thus, considering voice with temporal loss sensitivity as the foreground traffic of interest, with DifFRED a large number of short annoying bursts can be traded against a larger number of isolated losses and few long loss bursts (which occur when the queue is under temporary overload, i.e., awg > maxth, Fig. 10).",
                "We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2).",
                "This effect cannot be captured by the two state model (Eq. 4) which thus overestimates the burst loss length rate for Ic = 2 and then hugely underestimates it for k > 2.",
                "Interestingly, for Drop Tail, while both models capture the shape of the actual curve, the lower order model is more accurate in the estimation.",
                "This can be explained as follows: if the burst loss length probabilities are in fact close to a geometrical distribution, the estimate is more robust if all data is included (note that the run-length based approximation of the conditional loss probability P(X = mlX = m) only includes loss run-length occurences larger or equal to m: Eq. 1). sWe only discuss the results qualitatively here to give an example how an intra-flow loss control algorithm performs and to show how loss models can capture this performance.",

                "As the core algorithm gives only a binary marking decision (protect the packet or not), we employ a simple algorithm to send the necessary -1 packets for compensation (Eq. 5): after a burst of +l packets has been sent, a corresponding number of -1 packets is sent immediately.",
                "State about the necessary number of to-be-sent -1 packets is kept in the event that the SPB algorithm triggers the next +l burst before all -1 packets necessary for compensation are sent.",

                "Note that this effect is further aggravated by some interdependence between ADUs (i.e., that one ADU can only be decoded when a previous ADU before has successfully been received and decoded).",
                "For voice, as a single packet contains typically several ADUs (voice frames) this effect is thus more significant than e.g. for video.",

                "Let us consider a flow with two frame types of largely different perceptual importance (we assume same size, frequency and no interdependence between the frames).",
                "Under the loss of 50% of the packets, the perceptual quality varies hugely between the case where the 50% of the frames with high perceptual importance are received and the tax where the 50% less important frames are received.",
                "Network support for real-time multimedia flows can on one hand aim at offering a lossless service, which, however, to be implemented within a pa&et-switched network, will be costly for the network provider and thus for the user.",
                "On the other hand, within a lossy service, the above sensitivity constraints must be taken into account.",
                "It is our strong belief that this needs to be done in a generic way, i.e., no application-specific knowledge (about particular coding schemes e.g.) should be necessary within the network and, vice versa, no knowledge about network specifics should be necessary within an application.",

                "The decay of the utility function (for loss rates < 50%) is reduced, because the +l packets are protected and the endto-end loss recovery can thus operate properly over a wider range of loss rates indicated by the shaded area.",

                "Note that the higher the non-linearity of the utility contribution of the fl packets is (deviation from the dotted curve in Fig. 1 a), the higher is the potential gain in utility when the protection for +l packets is enabled.",

                "We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2).",

                "Network support for real-time multimedia flows can on one hand aim at offering a lossless service, which, however, to be implemented within a pa&et-switched network, will be costly for the network provider and thus for the user.",

                "Due to the over-proportional sensitivity of the +l packets to loss as well as the dependence of the end-t* end loss recovery performance on the fl packets, the utility function is decreasing significantly in a non-linear way (approximated in the figure by piece-wise linear functions) with an increasing loss rate.",

                "The decay of the utility function (for loss rates < 50%) is reduced, because the +l packets are protected and the endto-end loss recovery can thus operate properly over a wider range of loss rates indicated by the shaded area.",
                "This results in a graceful degradation of the applications utility.",
                "Note that the higher the non-linearity of the utility contribution of the fl packets is (deviation from the dotted curve in Fig. 1 a), the higher is the potential gain in utility when the protection for +l packets is enabled.",
                "Results for actual perceived quality as utility for multimedia applications exhibit such a non-linear behavior*.",

                "Schemes which, in the presence of loss, differentiate between pa&& within a flow as demonstrated in Figure 1 above, provide intra-flow QoS enhancement.",

                "To reduce this cost the feedback interval would need to be increased, then leading to a higher probability of wrong adaptation decisions.",
                "The major di6culty, however, is the lack of a codec which is truly scalable in terms of its output bitrate and corresponding perceptual quality.",
                "Currently standardized voice codecs ([17]) usually only have a 6xed output bitrate.",
                "While it has been proposed to switch between voice codeca ([2]), the MOS (subjective quality) values for the codecs employed do not differ much: e.g., theITU codecs G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726and G.711 cover a bitrate range from 5.3 kbitjs to 64 kbitjs while the subjective quality differs by less than 0.25 on a l-to-5 MOS scale ([4], 1: bad, 5: excellent quality).",

All combinations for the values (0 and 1) of the sequence Z(s-m), . . . , Z(s-2),Z(s-1) appear in the state space.",
                "As an example P( Z(s) = 1 ] Z(s - 2),Z(s1) = 01 ) gives the state transition probability when the current packet s is lost, the previous packet s - 1 has also been lost and packet s - 2 has not been lost.",

                "It is interesting to note that for all states with Z(s - 1) = 0 the probability for the next packet not to be lost (Z(s) = 0) is generally very high (> 0.8, in bold typeface) whereas when Z(s- 1) = 1 the state transition probabilities to that event cover the range of 0.15 to 0.61.",
                "That means that past no loss events do not affect the loss process as much as past loss events.",
                "Intuitively this seems to make sense, because a successfully arriving packet can be seen as a indicator for congestion relief.",
                "Andren et. al. ([l]) as well as Yajnik et. al. ([20]) both confirmed this by measuring the cross correlation of the loss- and no-loss-runlengths.",
                "They came to the result that such correlation is very weak.",
                "This implies that patterns of short loss bursts interspersed with short periods of successful packet arrivals occur rarely (note in this context that in &able 1 the pattern 101 has by far the lowest state probability).",

                "Most of the probability mass is concentrated at, isolated losses (the ideal behaviour would be the occurence of only isolated losses (Ic = 1) which can be expressed with clp = 0 in terms of Gilbert model parameters).",
                "With Drop Tail an approximately geometrically decreasing burst loss probability with increasing burst length (Eq. 4) is obtainable, where the clp parameter is relatively large though.",
                "Thus, considering voice with temporal loss sensitivity as the foreground traffic of interest, with DifFRED a large number of short annoying bursts can be traded against a larger number of isolated losses and few long loss bursts (which occur when the queue is under temporary overload, i.e., awg > maxth, Fig. 10).",
                "We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2).",
                "This effect cannot be captured by the two state model (Eq. 4) which thus overestimates the burst loss length rate for Ic = 2 and then hugely underestimates it for k > 2.",

                "This can be explained as follows: if the burst loss length probabilities are in fact close to a geometrical distribution, the estimate is more robust if all data is included (note that the run-length based approximation of the conditional loss probability P(X = mlX = m) only includes loss run-length occurences larger or equal to m: Eq. 1). sWe only discuss the results qualitatively here to give an example how an intra-flow loss control algorithm performs and to show how loss models can capture this performance.",

                "As the core algorithm gives only a binary marking decision (protect the packet or not), we employ a simple algorithm to send the necessary -1 packets for compensation (Eq. 5): after a burst of +l packets has been sent, a corresponding number of -1 packets is sent immediately.",
                "State about the necessary number of to-be-sent -1 packets is kept in the event that the SPB algorithm triggers the next +l burst before all -1 packets necessary for compensation are sent.",

                "Note that this effect is further aggravated by some interdependence between ADUs (i.e., that one ADU can only be decoded when a previous ADU before has successfully been received and decoded).",
                "For voice, as a single packet contains typically several ADUs (voice frames) this effect is thus more significant than e.g. for video.",
                "It translates basically to isolated packet losses versus losses that occur in bursts.",
                "Sensitivity due to ADU heterogeneity: Certain ADUs might contain parts of the encoded signal which are Application Data Unit: the unit of data emitted by a source coder such as a video or voice frame. 441 Figure 1: Schematic utility functions dependent on the loss of more (+l) and less (-1) important packets more important with regard to user perception than others of the same flow.",
                "Let us consider a flow with two frame types of largely different perceptual importance (we assume same size, frequency and no interdependence between the frames).",
                "Under the loss of 50% of the packets, the perceptual quality varies hugely between the case where the 50% of the frames with high perceptual importance are received and the tax where the 50% less important frames are received.",
                "Network support for real-time multimedia flows can on one hand aim at offering a lossless service, which, however, to be implemented within a pa&et-switched network, will be costly for the network provider and thus for the user.",
                "On the other hand, within a lossy service, the above sensitivity constraints must be taken into account.",
                "It is our strong belief that this needs to be done in a generic way, i.e., no application-specific knowledge (about particular coding schemes e.g.) should be necessary within the network and, vice versa, no knowledge about network specifics should be necessary within an application.",
                "Let us now consider the case that 50% of packets of a flow are identified as more important (designated by +l) or less important (-1) due to any of the above sensitivity constraints.",
                "Figure 1 a) shows a generic utility function describing the applicationlevel Quality of Service (QoS) dependent on the percentage of packets lost.",
                "For real-time multimedia traffic, such utility should correspond to perceived video/voice quality.",
                "If the relative importance of the packets is not known by the transmission system, the loss rates for the +l and -1 packets are equal.",
                "Due to the over-proportional sensitivity of the +l packets to loss as well as the dependence of the end-t* end loss recovery performance on the fl packets, the utility function is decreasing significantly in a non-linear way (approximated in the figure by piece-wise linear functions) with an increasing loss rate.",
                "Figure 1 b) presents the CBS~ where all +l packets are protected at the expense of -1 pa&&.",
                "The decay of the utility function (for loss rates < 50%) is reduced, because the +l packets are protected and the endto-end loss recovery can thus operate properly over a wider range of loss rates indicated by the shaded area.",
                "This results in a graceful degradation of the applications utility.",
                "Note that the higher the non-linearity of the utility contribution of the fl packets is (deviation from the dotted curve in Fig. 1 a), the higher is the potential gain in utility when the protection for +l packets is enabled.",
                "Results for actual perceived quality as utility for multimedia applications exhibit such a non-linear behavior*.",
                "To describe this effect and provide a taxonomy for different QoS enhancement approaches, we introduce a novel terminology: we designate mechanisms which influence QoS parameters between Bows (thus decrease the loss rate of one flow at the expense of other flows) as inter-flow QoS.",
                "Schemes which, in the presence of loss, differentiate between pa&& within a flow as demonstrated in Figure 1 above, provide intra-flow QoS enhancement.",
                "As QoS mechanisms have to be implemented within the network (hopby-hop) and/or in the end systems (end-to-end), we have another axis of classification.",
                "The adaptation of the senders bitrate to the current network congestion state as an intraflow QoS scheme (loss avoidance, [IS]) is difficult to apply to voice.",
                "Considering that voice flows have a very low bitrate, the relative cost of transmitting the feedback information is high (when compared e.g. to a video flow).",
                "To reduce this cost the feedback interval would need to be increased, then leading to a higher probability of wrong adaptation decisions.",
                "The major di6culty, however, is the lack of a codec which is truly scalable in terms of its output bitrate and corresponding perceptual quality.",
                "Currently standardized voice codecs ([17]) usually only have a 6xed output bitrate.",
                "While it has been proposed to switch between voice codeca ([2]), the MOS (subjective quality) values for the codecs employed do not differ much: e.g., theITU codecs G.723.1, G.729, G.728, G.726and G.711 cover a bitrate range from 5.3 kbitjs to 64 kbitjs while the subjective quality differs by less than 0.25 on a l-to-5 MOS scale ([4], 1: bad, 5: excellent quality).",
                "So when the availability of sutticient computing power is assumed, the lowest bitrate codec can be chosen permanently without actually decreasing the perceptual quality.",
                "For loss recovery on an end-to-end basis, due to the realtime delay constraints, open-loop schemes like Forward Error Correction (FEC) have been proposed ([2]).",
                "While such schemes are attractive because they can be used on the Internet today, they also have several drawbacks.",
                "The amount of redundant information needs to be adaptive to avoid taking bandwidth away from other flows.",
                "This adaptation is crucial especially when the fraction of traflic using redundancy schemes is large (181).",
                "If the redundancy is a source coding itself, like it has often been proposed ([7]), the comments from above on adaptation also apply.",
                "Using redundancy has also implications to the playout delay adaptation ([lo]) employed to de-jitter the packets at the receiver.",
                "Note that the presented types of loss sensitivity also apply to apWhile we have obtained results which confirm the shape of the overall utility curve shown in Fig. 1, clearly the utility functions of the +1/-l sub.flows and their relationship are more complex and only approximately additive. 442 Table 1: State and transition probabilities computed for an end-to-end Internet trace using a general Markov model (third order) by Yajnik et. al.

                "End-to-end mechanisms can reduce and shift such sensitivities but cannot come close to eliminate them.",
                "Therefore in this work we assume that the lowest possible bitrate which provides the desired quality is chosen.",
                "Neither feedback/adaptation nor redundancy is used, however, at the end-to-end level, identification/marking of packets sensitive to loss (sender) as well as <br>loss concealment</br> (receiver) takes place.",
                "Hop-by-hop support schemes then allow trading the loss of one packet, which is considered more important, against another one of the same flow which is of lower importance.",
                "We employ actual codecs and measure their utility in the presence of packet loss using objective speech quality measurement.",
                "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces packet- and user-level metrics.",
                "We employ these metrics to describe the sensitivity of VoIP traffic to packet loss in section 3.",
                "Section 4 briefly introduces a queue management algorithm which can be used for intra-flow loss control.",
                "In section 5, we present results documenting the performance of the proposed mechanisms at both the end-to-end and hopby-hop level.",
                "Section 6 concludes the paper. 2.",
                "METRICS 2.1 Packet-level metrics A general Markov model ([19, S]) which describes the loss process is defined as follows: Let P( Z(s) ] Z(s - m),... ,Z(s - 2),Z(s - 1) ) be the state transition probability of a general Markov model of order m, where Z(s) is the loss indicator function for the packet with the sequence number s. All combinations for the values (0 and 1) of the sequence Z(s-m), . . . , Z(s-2),Z(s-1) appear in the state space.",
                "As an example P( Z(s) = 1 ] Z(s - 2),Z(s1) = 01 ) gives the state transition probability when the current packet s is lost, the previous packet s - 1 has also been lost and packet s - 2 has not been lost.",
                "The number of states of the model is 2.",
                "Two state transitions can take place from any of the states.",
                "Thus, the number of parameters which have to be computed is 2m+1.",
                "Even for relatively small m this amount of parameters is difficult to be evaluated and compared.",
                "Table 1 shows some values for the state and transition probabilities for a general Markov model of third order measured end-to-end in the Internet by Yajnik et. al. ([19]).",
                "It is interesting to note that for all states with Z(s - 1) = 0 the probability for the next packet not to be lost (Z(s) = 0) is generally very high (> 0.8, in bold typeface) whereas when Z(s- 1) = 1 the state transition probabilities to that event cover the range of 0.15 to 0.61.",
                "That means that past no loss events do not affect the loss process as much as past loss events.",
                "Intuitively this seems to make sense, because a successfully arriving packet can be seen as a indicator for congestion relief.",
                "Andren et. al. ([l]) as well as Yajnik et. al. ([20]) both confirmed this by measuring the cross correlation of the loss- and no-loss-runlengths.",
                "They came to the result that such correlation is very weak.",
                "This implies that patterns of short loss bursts interspersed with short periods of successful packet arrivals occur rarely (note in this context that in &able 1 the pattern 101 has by far the lowest state probability).",
                "Thus, in the following we employ a model ([12]) which only considers the past loss events for the state transition probability.",
                "The number of states of the model can be reduced from 2m to m + 1.",
                "This means that we only consider the state transition probability P( Z(s) ] Z(s - k), . . . ,Z(s - 1) ) with Z(s - Ic + i) = 1 V i E [0, Ic - 11, where Ic (0 < k 5 m) is a variable parameter.",

                "With this definition, we establish a loss run-length model with a finite number of states (m + 1) which gives loss probabilities dependent on the burst length.",
                "In the model, for every additional lost packet which adds to the length of a loss burst a state transition takes place.",
                "If a packet is successfully received, the state returns to X = 0.",

                "In our evaluation we use two objective quality measures: the Enhanced Mod&d Bark Spectral Distortion (EMBSD, [21]) and the Measw ing Normalizing Blocks (MNB) described in the Appendix II of the ITU-T Recommendation P.861 ([18]).",
                "These two objective quality measure.~ are reported to have a very high correlation with subjective tests, their relation to the range of subjective test result values (MOS) is close to being linear and they are recommended as being suitable for the evaluation of speech degraded by transmission errors in real network environments such as bit errors and frame erasures ([18, 211).",
                "Both metrics are distance measures, i.e., a IB suit value of 0 implies perfect quality, the larger the value, the worse the speech quality is (in Fig. 5 we show an axis with approximate corresponding MOS values).",

                "By averaging the result of the objective quality measure for several loss patterns, we have a reliable indication for the performance of the codec operating under a certain network loss condition.",

                "We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2).",

                "We can observe that DiffRED shapes the burst probability curve in the desired way.",
                "Most of the probability mass is concentrated at, isolated losses (the ideal behaviour would be the occurence of only isolated losses (Ic = 1) which can be expressed with clp = 0 in terms of Gilbert model parameters).",
                "With Drop Tail an approximately geometrically decreasing burst loss probability with increasing burst length (Eq. 4) is obtainable, where the clp parameter is relatively large though.",

                "We can see that the three-state model estimation (Eq. 2) reflects the two areas of the DifFRED operation (the sharp drop of the burst loss length rate for k = 2 and the decrease along a geometrically decreasing asymptote for k > 2).",
                "This effect cannot be captured by the two state model (Eq. 4) which thus overestimates the burst loss length rate for Ic = 2 and then hugely underestimates it for k > 2.",

                "This can be explained as follows: if the burst loss length probabilities are in fact close to a geometrical distribution, the estimate is more robust if all data is included (note that the run-length based approximation of the conditional loss probability P(X = mlX = m) only includes loss run-length occurences larger or equal to m: Eq. 1). sWe only discuss the results qualitatively here to give an example how an intra-flow loss control algorithm performs and to show how loss models can capture this performance.",
