This new framework shows an efficient and effective way to infer the probabilities of relevance of all the documents across the text databases. With the estimated relevance information, resource selection can be made by explicitly optimizing the goals of different applications. Specifically, when used for database recommendation, the selection is optimized for the goal of highrecall (include as many relevant documents as possible in the selected databases); when used for distributed document retrieval, the selection targets the high-precision goal (high precision in the final merged list of documents). This new model provides a more solid framework for distributed information retrieval. Empirical studies show that it is at least as effective as other state-of-the-art algorithms.

INTRODUCTION Conventional search engines such as Google or AltaVista use ad-hoc information retrieval solution by assuming all the searchable documents can be copied into a single centralized database for the purpose of indexing. Distributed information retrieval, also known as federated search [1,4,7,11,14,22] is different from ad-hoc information retrieval as it addresses the cases when documents cannot be acquired and stored in a single database. For example, Hidden Web contents (also called invisible or deep Web contents) are information on the Web that cannot be accessed by the conventional search engines. Hidden web contents have been estimated to be 2-50 [19] times larger than the contents that can be searched by conventional search engines. Therefore, it is very important to search this type of valuable information. The architecture of distributed search solution is highly influenced by different environmental characteristics. In a small local area network such as small company environments, the information providers may cooperate to provide corpus statistics or use the same type of search engines. Early distributed information retrieval research focused on this type of cooperative environments [1,8]. On the other side, in a wide area network such as very large corporate environments or on the Web there are many types of search engines and it is difficult to assume that all the information providers can cooperate as they are required. Even if they are willing to cooperate in these environments, it may be hard to enforce a single solution for all the information providers or to detect whether information sources provide the correct information as they are required. Many applications fall into the latter type of uncooperative environments such as the Mind project [16] which integrates non-cooperating digital libraries or the QProber system [9] which supports browsing and searching of uncooperative hidden Web databases. In this paper, we focus mainly on uncooperative environments that contain multiple types of independent search engines. There are three important sub-problems in distributed information retrieval. First, information about the contents of each individual database must be acquired (resource representation) [1,8,21]. Second, given a query, a set of resources must be selected to do the search (resource selection) [5,7,21]. Third, the results retrieved from all the selected resources have to be merged into a single final list before it can be presented to the end user (retrieval and results merging) [1,5,20,22]. Many types of solutions exist for distributed information retrieval. Invisible-web.net1 provides guided browsing of hidden Web databases by collecting the resource descriptions of these databases and building hierarchies of classes that group them by similar topics. A database recommendation system goes a step further than a browsing system like Invisible-web.net by recommending most relevant information sources to users queries. It is composed of the resource description and the resource selection components. This solution is useful when the users want to browse the selected databases by themselves instead of asking the system to retrieve relevant documents automatically. Distributed document retrieval is a more sophisticated task. It selects relevant information sources for users queries as the database recommendation system does. Furthermore, users queries are forwarded to the corresponding selected databases and the returned individual ranked lists are merged into a single list to present to the users. The goal of a database recommendation system is to select a small set of resources that contain as many relevant documents as possible, which we call a high-recall goal. On the other side, the effectiveness of distributed document retrieval is often measured by the Precision of the final merged document result list, which we call a high-precision goal. Prior research indicated that these two goals are related but not identical [4,21]. However, most previous solutions simply use effective resource selection algorithm of database recommendation system for distributed document retrieval system or solve the inconsistency with heuristic methods [1,4,21]. This paper presents a unified utility maximization framework to integrate the resource selection problem of both database recommendation and distributed document retrieval together by treating them as different optimization goals. First, a centralized sample database is built by randomly sampling a small amount of documents from each database with query-based sampling [1]; database size statistics are also estimated [21]. A logistic transformation model is learned off line with a small amount of training queries to map the centralized document scores in the centralized sample database to the corresponding probabilities of relevance. Second, after a new query is submitted, the query can be used to search the centralized sample database which produces a score for each sampled document. The probability of relevance for each document in the centralized sample database can be estimated by applying the logistic model to each documents score. Then, the probabilities of relevance of all the (mostly unseen) documents among the available databases can be estimated using the probabilities of relevance of the documents in the centralized sample database and the database size estimates. For the task of resource selection for a database recommendation system, the databases can be ranked by the expected number of relevant documents to meet the high-recall goal. For resource selection for a distributed document retrieval system, databases containing a small number of documents with large probabilities of relevance are favored over databases containing many documents with small probabilities of relevance. This selection criterion meets the high-precision goal of distributed document retrieval application. Furthermore, the Semi-supervised learning (SSL) [20,22] algorithm is applied to merge the returned documents into a final ranked list. The unified utility framework makes very few assumptions and works in uncooperative environments. Two key features make it a more solid model for distributed information retrieval: i) It formalizes the resource selection problems of different applications as various utility functions, and optimizes the utility functions to achieve the optimal results accordingly; and ii) It shows an effective and efficient way to estimate the probabilities of relevance of all documents across databases. Specifically, the framework builds logistic models on the centralized sample database to transform centralized retrieval scores to the corresponding probabilities of relevance and uses the centralized sample database as the bridge between individual databases and the logistic model. The human effort (relevance judgment) required to train the single centralized logistic model does not scale with the number of databases. This is a large advantage over previous research, which required the amount of human effort to be linear with the number of databases [7,15]. The unified utility framework is not only more theoretically solid but also very effective. Empirical studies show the new model to be at least as accurate as the state-of-the-art algorithms in a variety of configurations. The next section discusses related work. Section 3 describes the new unified utility maximization model. Section 4 explains our experimental methodology. Sections 5 and 6 present our experimental results for resource selection and document retrieval. Section 7 concludes. 2. PRIOR RESEARCH There has been considerable research on all the sub-problems of distributed information retrieval. We survey the most related work in this section. The first problem of distributed information retrieval is resource representation. The STARTS protocol is one solution for acquiring resource descriptions in cooperative environments [8]. However, in uncooperative environments, even the databases are willing to share their information, it is not easy to judge whether the information they provide is accurate or not. Furthermore, it is not easy to coordinate the databases to provide resource representations that are compatible with each other. Thus, in uncooperative environments, one common choice is query-based sampling, which randomly generates and sends queries to individual search engines and retrieves some documents to build the descriptions. As the sampled documents are selected by random queries, query-based sampling is not easily fooled by any adversarial spammer that is interested to attract more traffic. Experiments have shown that rather accurate resource descriptions can be built by sending about 80 queries and downloading about 300 documents [1]. Many resource selection algorithms such as gGlOSS/vGlOSS [8] and CORI [1] have been proposed in the last decade. The CORI algorithm represents each database by its terms, the document frequencies and a small number of corpus statistics (details in [1]). As prior research on different datasets has shown the CORI algorithm to be the most stable and effective of the three algorithms [1,17,18], we use it as a baseline algorithm in this work. The relevant document distribution estimation (ReDDE [21]) resource selection algorithm is a recent algorithm that tries to estimate the distribution of relevant documents across the available databases and ranks the databases accordingly. Although the ReDDE algorithm has been shown to be effective, it relies on heuristic constants that are set empirically [21]. The last step of the document retrieval sub-problem is results merging, which is the process of transforming database-specific 33 document scores into comparable database-independent document scores. The semi supervised learning (SSL) [20,22] result merging algorithm uses the documents acquired by querybased sampling as training data and linear regression to learn the database-specific, query-specific merging models. These linear models are used to convert the database-specific document scores into the approximated centralized document scores. The SSL algorithm has been shown to be effective [22]. It serves as an important component of our unified utility maximization framework (Section 3). In order to achieve accurate document retrieval results, many previous methods simply use resource selection algorithms that are effective of database recommendation system. But as pointed out above, a good resource selection algorithm optimized for high-recall may not work well for document retrieval, which targets the high-precision goal. This type of inconsistency has been observed in previous research [4,21]. The research in [21] tried to solve the problem with a heuristic method. The research most similar to what we propose here is the decision-theoretic framework (DTF) [7,15]. This framework computes a selection that minimizes the overall costs (e.g., retrieval quality, time) of document retrieval system and several methods [15] have been proposed to estimate the retrieval quality. However, two points distinguish our research from the DTF model. First, the DTF is a framework designed specifically for document retrieval, but our new model integrates two distinct applications with different requirements (database recommendation and distributed document retrieval) into the same unified framework. Second, the DTF builds a model for each database to calculate the probabilities of relevance. This requires human relevance judgments for the results retrieved from each database. In contrast, our approach only builds one logistic model for the centralized sample database. The centralized sample database can serve as a bridge to connect the individual databases with the centralized logistic model, thus the probabilities of relevance of documents in different databases can be estimated. This strategy can save large amount of human judgment effort and is a big advantage of the unified utility maximization framework over the DTF especially when there are a large number of databases. 3. UNIFIED UTILITY MAXIMIZATION FRAMEWORK The Unified Utility Maximization (UUM) framework is based on estimating the probabilities of relevance of the (mostly unseen) documents available in the distributed search environment. In this section we describe how the probabilities of relevance are estimated and how they are used by the Unified Utility Maximization model. We also describe how the model can be optimized for the high-recall goal of a database recommendation system and the high-precision goal of a distributed document retrieval system. 3.1 Estimating Probabilities of Relevance As pointed out above, the purpose of resource selection is highrecall and the purpose of document retrieval is high-precision. In order to meet these diverse goals, the key issue is to estimate the probabilities of relevance of the documents in various databases. This is a difficult problem because we can only observe a sample of the contents of each database using query-based sampling. Our strategy is to make full use of all the available information to calculate the probability estimates. 3.1.1 Learning Probabilities of Relevance In the resource description step, the centralized sample database is built by query-based sampling and the database sizes are estimated using the sample-resample method [21]. At the same time, an effective retrieval algorithm (Inquery [2]) is applied on the centralized sample database with a small number (e.g., 50) of training queries. For each training query, the CORI resource selection algorithm [1] is applied to select some number (e.g., 10) of databases and retrieve 50 document ids from each database. The SSL results merging algorithm [20,22] is used to merge the results. Then, we can download the top 50 documents in the final merged list and calculate their corresponding centralized scores using Inquery and the corpus statistics of the centralized sample database. The centralized scores are further normalized (divided by the maximum centralized score for each query), as this method has been suggested to improve estimation accuracy in previous research [15]. Human judgment is acquired for those documents and a logistic model is built to transform the normalized centralized document scores to probabilities of relevance as follows: ( ) ))(exp(1 ))(exp( |)( _ _ dSba dSba drelPdR ccc ccc ++ + == (1) where )( _ dSc is the normalized centralized document score and ac and bc are the two parameters of the logistic model. These two parameters are estimated by maximizing the probabilities of relevance of the training queries. The logistic model provides us the tool to calculate the probabilities of relevance from centralized document scores. 3.1.2 Estimating Centralized Document Scores When the user submits a new query, the centralized document scores of the documents in the centralized sample database are calculated. However, in order to calculate the probabilities of relevance, we need to estimate centralized document scores for all documents across the databases instead of only the sampled documents. This goal is accomplished using: the centralized scores of the documents in the centralized sample database, and the database size statistics. We define the database scale factor for the ith database as the ratio of the estimated database size and the number of documents sampled from this database as follows: ^ _ i i i db db db samp N SF N = (2) where ^ idbN is the estimated database size and _idb sampN is the number of documents from the ith database in the centralized sample database. The intuition behind the database scale factor is that, for a database whose scale factor is 50, if one document from this database in the centralized sample database has a centralized document score of 0.5, we may guess that there are about 50 documents in that database which have scores of about 0.5. Actually, we can apply a finer non-parametric linear interpolation method to estimate the centralized document score curve for each database. Formally, we rank all the sampled documents from the ith database by their centralized document 34 scores to get the sampled centralized document score list {Sc(dsi1), Sc(dsi2), Sc(dsi3),…..} for the ith database; we assume that if we could calculate the centralized document scores for all the documents in this database and get the complete centralized document score list, the top document in the sampled list would have rank SFdbi/2, the second document in the sampled list would rank SFdbi3/2, and so on. Therefore, the data points of sampled documents in the complete list are: {(SFdbi/2, Sc(dsi1)), (SFdbi3/2, Sc(dsi2)), (SFdbi5/2, Sc(dsi3)),…..}. Piecewise linear interpolation is applied to estimate the centralized document score curve, as illustrated in Figure 1. The complete centralized document score list can be estimated by calculating the values of different ranks on the centralized document curve as: ],1[,)(S ^^ c idbij Njd ∈ . It can be seen from Figure 1 that more sample data points produce more accurate estimates of the centralized document score curves. However, for databases with large database scale ratios, this kind of linear interpolation may be rather inaccurate, especially for the top ranked (e.g., [1, SFdbi/2]) documents. Therefore, an alternative solution is proposed to estimate the centralized document scores of the top ranked documents for databases with large scale ratios (e.g., larger than 100). Specifically, a logistic model is built for each of these databases. The logistic model is used to estimate the centralized document score of the top 1 document in the corresponding database by using the two sampled documents from that database with highest centralized scores. ))()(exp(1 ))()(exp( )( 22110 22110 ^ 1 iciicii iciicii ic dsSdsS dsSdsS dS ααα ααα +++ ++ = (3) 0iα , 1iα and 2iα are the parameters of the logistic model. For each training query, the top retrieved document of each database is downloaded and the corresponding centralized document score is calculated. Together with the scores of the top two sampled documents, these parameters can be estimated. After the centralized score of the top document is estimated, an exponential function is fitted for the top part ([1, SFdbi/2]) of the centralized document score curve as: ]2/,1[)*exp()( 10 ^ idbiiijc SFjjdS ∈+= ββ (4) ^ 0 1 1log( ( ))i c i iS dβ β= − (5) )12/( ))(log()((log( ^ 11 1 − − = idb icic i SF dSdsS β (6) The two parameters 0iβ and 1iβ are fitted to make sure the exponential function passes through the two points (1, ^ 1)( ic dS ) and (SFdbi/2, Sc(dsi1)). The exponential function is only used to adjust the top part of the centralized document score curve and the lower part of the curve is still fitted with the linear interpolation method described above. The adjustment by fitting exponential function of the top ranked documents has been shown empirically to produce more accurate results. From the centralized document score curves, we can estimate the complete centralized document score lists accordingly for all the available databases. After the estimated centralized document scores are normalized, the complete lists of probabilities of relevance can be constructed out of the complete centralized document score lists by Equation 1. Formally for the ith database, the complete list of probabilities of relevance is: ],1[,)(R ^^ idbij Njd ∈ . 3.2 The Unified Utility Maximization Model In this section, we formally define the new unified utility maximization model, which optimizes the resource selection problems for two goals of high-recall (database recommendation) and high-precision (distributed document retrieval) in the same framework. In the task of database recommendation, the system needs to decide how to rank databases. In the task of document retrieval, the system not only needs to select the databases but also needs to decide how many documents to retrieve from each selected database. We generalize the database recommendation selection process, which implicitly recommends all documents in every selected database, as a special case of the selection decision for the document retrieval task. Formally, we denote di as the number of documents we would like to retrieve from the ith database and ,.....},{ 21 ddd = as a selection action for all the databases. The database selection decision is made based on the complete lists of probabilities of relevance for all the databases. The complete lists of probabilities of relevance are inferred from all the available information specifically sR , which stands for the resource descriptions acquired by query-based sampling and the database size estimates acquired by sample-resample; cS stands for the centralized document scores of the documents in the centralized sample database. If the method of estimating centralized document scores and probabilities of relevance in Section 3.1 is acceptable, then the most probable complete lists of probabilities of relevance can be derived and we denote them as 1 ^ ^ * 1{(R( ), [1, ]),dbjd j Nθ = ∈ 2 ^ ^ 2(R( ), [1, ]),.......}dbjd j N∈ . Random vector   denotes an arbitrary set of complete lists of probabilities of relevance and ),|( cs SRP θ as the probability of generating this set of lists. Finally, to each selection action d and a set of complete lists of Figure 1. Linear interpolation construction of the complete centralized document score list (database scale factor is 50). 35 probabilities of relevance θ , we associate a utility function ),( dU θ which indicates the benefit from making the d selection when the true complete lists of probabilities of relevance are θ . Therefore, the selection decision defined by the Bayesian framework is: θθθ θ dSRPdUd cs d ).|(),(maxarg * = (7) One common approach to simplify the computation in the Bayesian framework is to only calculate the utility function at the most probable parameter values instead of calculating the whole expectation. In other words, we only need to calculate ),( * dU θ and Equation 7 is simplified as follows: ),(maxarg * * θdUd d = (8) This equation serves as the basic model for both the database recommendation system and the document retrieval system. 3.3 Resource Selection for High-Recall High-recall is the goal of the resource selection algorithm in federated search tasks such as database recommendation. The goal is to select a small set of resources (e.g., less than Nsdb databases) that contain as many relevant documents as possible, which can be formally defined as: = = i N j iji idb ddIdU ^ 1 ^ * )(R)(),( θ (9) I(di) is the indicator function, which is 1 when the ith database is selected and 0 otherwise. Plug this equation into the basic model in Equation 8 and associate the selected database number constraint to obtain the following: sdb i i i N j iji d NdItoSubject ddId idb = = = )(: )(R)(maxarg ^ 1 ^* (10) The solution of this optimization problem is very simple. We can calculate the expected number of relevant documents for each database as follows: = = idb i N j ijRd dN ^ 1 ^^ )(R (11) The Nsdb databases with the largest expected number of relevant documents can be selected to meet the high-recall goal. We call this the UUM/HR algorithm (Unified Utility Maximization for High-Recall). 3.4 Resource Selection for High-Precision High-Precision is the goal of resource selection algorithm in federated search tasks such as distributed document retrieval. It is measured by the Precision at the top part of the final merged document list. This high-precision criterion is realized by the following utility function, which measures the Precision of retrieved documents from the selected databases. = = i d j iji i ddIdU 1 ^ * )(R)(),( θ (12) Note that the key difference between Equation 12 and Equation 9 is that Equation 9 sums up the probabilities of relevance of all the documents in a database, while Equation 12 only considers a much smaller part of the ranking. Specifically, we can calculate the optimal selection decision by: = = i d j iji d i ddId 1 ^* )(R)(maxarg (13) Different kinds of constraints caused by different characteristics of the document retrieval tasks can be associated with the above optimization problem. The most common one is to select a fixed number (Nsdb) of databases and retrieve a fixed number (Nrdoc) of documents from each selected database, formally defined as: 0, )(: )(R)(maxarg 1 ^* ≠= = = = irdoci sdb i i i d j iji d difNd NdItoSubject ddId i (14) This optimization problem can be solved easily by calculating the number of expected relevant documents in the top part of the each databases complete list of probabilities of relevance: = = rdoc i N j ijRdTop dN 1 ^^ _ )(R (15) Then the databases can be ranked by these values and selected. We call this the UUM/HP-FL algorithm (Unified Utility Maximization for High-Precision with Fixed Length document rankings from each selected database). A more complex situation is to vary the number of retrieved documents from each selected database. More specifically, we allow different selected databases to return different numbers of documents. For simplification, the result list lengths are required to be multiples of a baseline number 10. (This value can also be varied, but for simplification it is set to 10 in this paper.) This restriction is set to simulate the behavior of commercial search engines on the Web. (Search engines such as Google and AltaVista return only 10 or 20 document ids for every result page.) This procedure saves the computation time of calculating optimal database selection by allowing the step of dynamic programming to be 10 instead of 1 (more detail is discussed latterly). For further simplification, we restrict to select at most 100 documents from each database (di<=100) Then, the selection optimization problem is formalized as follows: ]10..,,2,1,0[,*10 )(: )(R)(maxarg _ 1 ^* ∈= = = = = kkd Nd NdItoSubject ddId i rdocTotal i i sdb i i i d j iji d i (16) NTotal_rdoc is the total number of documents to be retrieved. Unfortunately, there is no simple solution for this optimization problem as there are for Equations 10 and 14. However, a 36 dynamic programming algorithm can be applied to calculate the optimal solution. The basic steps of this dynamic programming method are described in Figure 2. As this algorithm allows retrieving result lists of varying lengths from each selected database, it is called UUM/HP-VL algorithm. After the selection decisions are made, the selected databases are searched and the corresponding document ids are retrieved from each database. The final step of document retrieval is to merge the returned results into a single ranked list with the semisupervised learning algorithm. It was pointed out before that the SSL algorithm maps the database-specific scores into the centralized document scores and builds the final ranked list accordingly, which is consistent with all our selection procedures where documents with higher probabilities of relevance (thus higher centralized document scores) are selected. 4. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY 4.1 Testbeds It is desirable to evaluate distributed information retrieval algorithms with testbeds that closely simulate the real world applications. The TREC Web collections WT2g or WT10g [4,13] provide a way to partition documents by different Web servers. In this way, a large number (O(1000)) of databases with rather diverse contents could be created, which may make this testbed a good candidate to simulate the operational environments such as open domain hidden Web. However, two weakness of this testbed are: i) Each database contains only a small amount of document (259 documents by average for WT2g) [4]; and ii) The contents of WT2g or WT10g are arbitrarily crawled from the Web. It is not likely for a hidden Web database to provide personal homepages or web pages indicating that the pages are under construction and there is no useful information at all. These types of web pages are contained in the WT2g/WT10g datasets. Therefore, the noisy Web data is not similar with that of high-quality hidden Web database contents, which are usually organized by domain experts. Another choice is the TREC news/government data [1,15,17, 18,21]. TREC news/government data is concentrated on relatively narrow topics. Compared with TREC Web data: i) The news/government documents are much more similar to the contents provided by a topic-oriented database than an arbitrary web page, ii) A database in this testbed is larger than that of TREC Web data. By average a database contains thousands of documents, which is more realistic than a database of TREC Web data with about 250 documents. As the contents and sizes of the databases in the TREC news/government testbed are more similar with that of a topic-oriented database, it is a good candidate to simulate the distributed information retrieval environments of large organizations (companies) or domainspecific hidden Web sites, such as West that provides access to legal, financial and news text databases [3]. As most current distributed information retrieval systems are developed for the environments of large organizations (companies) or domainspecific hidden Web other than open domain hidden Web, TREC news/government testbed was chosen in this work. Trec123-100col-bysource testbed is one of the most used TREC news/government testbed [1,15,17,21]. It was chosen in this work. Three testbeds in [21] with skewed database size distributions and different types of relevant document distributions were also used to give more thorough simulation for real environments. Trec123-100col-bysource: 100 databases were created from TREC CDs 1, 2 and 3. They were organized by source and publication date [1]. The sizes of the databases are not skewed. Details are in Table 1. Three testbeds built in [21] were based on the trec123-100colbysource testbed. Each testbed contains many small databases and two large databases created by merging about 10-20 small databases together. Input: Complete lists of probabilities of relevance for all the |DB| databases. Output: Optimal selection solution for Equation 16. i) Create the three-dimensional array: Sel (1..|DB|, 1..NTotal_rdoc/10, 1..Nsdb) Each Sel (x, y, z) is associated with a selection decision xyzd , which represents the best selection decision in the condition: only databases from number 1 to number x are considered for selection; totally y*10 documents will be retrieved; only z databases are selected out of the x database candidates. And Sel (x, y, z) is the corresponding utility value by choosing the best selection. ii) Initialize Sel (1, 1..NTotal_rdoc/10, 1..Nsdb) with only the estimated relevance information of the 1st database. iii) Iterate the current database candidate i from 2 to |DB| For each entry Sel (i, y, z): Find k such that: )10,min(1: ))()1,,1((maxarg *10 ^ * yktosubject dRzkyiSelk kj ij k ≤≤ +−−−= ≤ ),,1())()1,,1(( * *10 ^ * zyiSeldRzkyiSelIf kj ij −>+−−− ≤ This means that we should retrieve * 10 k∗ documents from the ith database, otherwise we should not select this database and the previous best solution Sel (i-1, y, z) should be kept. Then set the value of iyzd and Sel (i, y, z) accordingly. iv) The best selection solution is given by _ /10| | Toral rdoc sdbDB N Nd and the corresponding utility value is Sel (|DB|, NTotal_rdoc/10, Nsdb).

Name TREC Topic Set TREC Topic Field Average Length (Words) Trec123 51-150 Title 3.1 37 Trec123-2ldb-60col (representative): The databases in the trec123-100col-bysource were sorted with alphabetical order. Two large databases were created by merging 20 small databases with the round-robin method. Thus, the two large databases have more relevant documents due to their large sizes, even though the densities of relevant documents are roughly the same as the small databases. Trec123-AP-WSJ-60col (relevant): The 24 Associated Press collections and the 16 Wall Street Journal collections in the trec123-100col-bysource testbed were collapsed into two large databases APall and WSJall. The other 60 collections were left unchanged. The APall and WSJall databases have higher densities of documents relevant to TREC queries than the small databases. Thus, the two large databases have many more relevant documents than the small databases. Trec123-FR-DOE-81col (nonrelevant): The 13 Federal Register collections and the 6 Department of Energy collections in the trec123-100col-bysource testbed were collapsed into two large databases FRall and DOEall. The other 80 collections were left unchanged. The FRall and DOEall databases have lower densities of documents relevant to TREC queries than the small databases, even though they are much larger. 100 queries were created from the title fields of TREC topics 51-150. The queries 101-150 were used as training queries and the queries 51-100 were used as test queries (details in Table 2). 4.2 Search Engines In the uncooperative distributed information retrieval environments of large organizations (companies) or domainspecific hidden Web, different databases may use different types of search engine. To simulate the multiple type-engine environment, three different types of search engines were used in the experiments: INQUERY [2], a unigram statistical language model with linear smoothing [12,20] and a TFIDF retrieval algorithm with ltc weight [12,20]. All these algorithms were implemented with the Lemur toolkit [12]. These three kinds of search engines were assigned to the databases among the four testbeds in a round-robin manner. 5. RESULTS: RESOURCE SELECTION OF DATABASE RECOMMENDATION All four testbeds described in Section 4 were used in the experiments to evaluate the resource selection effectiveness of the database recommendation system. The resource descriptions were created using query-based sampling. About 80 queries were sent to each database to download 300 unique documents. The database size statistics were estimated by the sample-resample method [21]. Fifty queries (101-150) were used as training queries to build the relevant logistic model and to fit the exponential functions of the centralized document score curves for large ratio databases (details in Section 3.1). Another 50 queries (51-100) were used as test data. Resource selection algorithms of database recommendation systems are typically compared using the recall metric nR [1,17,18,21]. Let B denote a baseline ranking, which is often the RBR (relevance based ranking), and E as a ranking provided by a resource selection algorithm. And let Bi and Ei denote the number of relevant documents in the ith ranked database of B or E. Then Rn is defined as follows: = = = k i i k i i k B E R 1 1 (17) Usually the goal is to search only a few databases, so our figures only show results for selecting up to 20 databases. The experiments summarized in Figure 3 compared the effectiveness of the three resource selection algorithms, namely the CORI, ReDDE and UUM/HR. The UUM/HR algorithm is described in Section 3.3. It can be seen from Figure 3 that the ReDDE and UUM/HR algorithms are more effective (on the representative, relevant and nonrelevant testbeds) or as good as (on the Trec123-100Col testbed) the CORI resource selection algorithm. The UUM/HR algorithm is more effective than the ReDDE algorithm on the representative and relevant testbeds and is about the same as the ReDDE algorithm on the Trec123100Col and the nonrelevant testbeds. This suggests that the UUM/HR algorithm is more robust than the ReDDE algorithm. It can be noted that when selecting only a few databases on the Trec123-100Col or the nonrelevant testbeds, the ReDEE algorithm has a small advantage over the UUM/HR algorithm. We attribute this to two causes: i) The ReDDE algorithm was tuned on the Trec123-100Col testbed; and ii) Although the difference is small, this may suggest that our logistic model of estimating probabilities of relevance is not accurate enough. More training data or a more sophisticated model may help to solve this minor puzzle. Collections Selected. Collections Selected. Trec123-100Col Testbed. Representative Testbed. Collection Selected.

RESULTS: DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL EFFECTIVENESS For document retrieval, the selected databases are searched and the returned results are merged into a single final list. In all of the experiments discussed in this section the results retrieved from individual databases were combined by the semisupervised learning results merging algorithm. This version of the SSL algorithm [22] is allowed to download a small number of returned document texts on the fly to create additional training data in the process of learning the linear models which map database-specific document scores into estimated centralized document scores. It has been shown to be very effective in environments where only short result-lists are retrieved from each selected database [22]. This is a common scenario in operational environments and was the case for our experiments. Document retrieval effectiveness was measured by Precision at the top part of the final document list. The experiments in this section were conducted to study the document retrieval effectiveness of five selection algorithms, namely the CORI, ReDDE, UUM/HR, UUM/HP-FL and UUM/HP-VL algorithms. The last three algorithms were proposed in Section 3. All the first four algorithms selected 3 or 5 databases, and 50 documents were retrieved from each selected database. The UUM/HP-FL algorithm also selected 3 or 5 databases, but it was allowed to adjust the number of documents to retrieve from each selected database; the number retrieved was constrained to be from 10 to 100, and a multiple of 10. The Trec123-100Col and representative testbeds were selected for document retrieval as they represent two extreme cases of resource selection effectiveness; in one case the CORI algorithm is as good as the other algorithms and in the other case it is quite Table 5.

Tables 3 and 4 show the results on the Trec123-100Col testbed, and Tables 5 and 6 show the results on the representative testbed. On the Trec123-100Col testbed, the document retrieval effectiveness of the CORI selection algorithm is roughly the same or a little bit better than the ReDDE algorithm but both of them are worse than the other three algorithms (Tables 3 and 4). The UUM/HR algorithm has a small advantage over the CORI and ReDDE algorithms. One main difference between the UUM/HR algorithm and the ReDDE algorithm was pointed out before: The UUM/HR uses training data and linear interpolation to estimate the centralized document score curves, while the ReDDE algorithm [21] uses a heuristic method, assumes the centralized document score curves are step functions and makes no distinction among the top part of the curves. This difference makes UUM/HR better than the ReDDE algorithm at distinguishing documents with high probabilities of relevance from low probabilities of relevance. Therefore, the UUM/HR reflects the high-precision retrieval goal better than the ReDDE algorithm and thus is more effective for document retrieval. The UUM/HR algorithm does not explicitly optimize the selection decision with respect to the high-precision goal as the UUM/HP-FL and UUM/HP-VL algorithms are designed to do. It can be seen that on this testbed, the UUM/HP-FL and UUM/HP-VL algorithms are much more effective than all the other algorithms. This indicates that their power comes from explicitly optimizing the high-precision goal of document retrieval in Equations 14 and 16. On the representative testbed, CORI is much less effective than other algorithms for distributed document retrieval (Tables 5 and 6). The document retrieval results of the ReDDE algorithm are better than that of the CORI algorithm but still worse than the results of the UUM/HR algorithm. On this testbed the three UUM algorithms are about equally effective. Detailed analysis shows that the overlap of the selected databases between the UUM/HR, UUM/HP-FL and UUM/HP-VL algorithms is much larger than the experiments on the Trec123-100Col testbed, since all of them tend to select the two large databases. This explains why they are about equally effective for document retrieval. In real operational environments, databases may return no document scores and report only ranked lists of results. As the unified utility maximization model only utilizes retrieval scores of sampled documents with a centralized retrieval algorithm to calculate the probabilities of relevance, it makes database selection decisions without referring to the document scores from individual databases and can be easily generalized to this case of rank lists without document scores. The only adjustment is that the SSL algorithm merges ranked lists without document scores by assigning the documents with pseudo-document scores normalized for their ranks (In a ranked list of 50 documents, the first one has a score of 1, the second has a score of 0.98 etc) ,which has been studied in [22]. The experiment results on trec123-100Col-bysource testbed with 3 selected databases are shown in Table 7. The experiment setting was the same as before except that the document scores were eliminated intentionally and the selected databases only return ranked lists of document ids. It can be seen from the results that the UUM/HP-FL and UUM/HP-VL work well with databases returning no document scores and are still more effective than other alternatives. Other experiments with databases that return no document scores are not reported but they show similar results to prove the effectiveness of UUM/HP-FL and UUM/HPVL algorithms. The above experiments suggest that it is very important to optimize the high-precision goal explicitly in document retrieval. The new algorithms based on this principle achieve better or at least as good results as the prior state-of-the-art algorithms in several environments. 7. CONCLUSION Distributed information retrieval solves the problem of finding information that is scattered among many text databases on local area networks and Internets. Most previous research use effective resource selection algorithm of database recommendation system for distributed document retrieval application. We argue that the high-recall resource selection goal of database recommendation and high-precision goal of document retrieval are related but not identical. This kind of inconsistency has also been observed in previous work, but the prior solutions either used heuristic methods or assumed cooperation by individual databases (e.g., all the databases used the same kind of search engines), which is frequently not true in the uncooperative environment. In this work we propose a unified utility maximization model to integrate the resource selection of database recommendation and document retrieval tasks into a single unified framework. In this framework, the selection decisions are obtained by optimizing different objective functions. As far as we know, this is the first work that tries to view and theoretically model the distributed information retrieval task in an integrated manner. The new framework continues a recent research trend studying the use of query-based sampling and a centralized sample database. A single logistic model was trained on the centralized Table 7.

Therefore, the probabilities of relevance for all the documents across the databases can be estimated with very small amount of human relevance judgment, which is much more efficient than previous methods that build a separate model for each database. This framework is not only more theoretically solid but also very effective. One algorithm for resource selection (UUM/HR) and two algorithms for document retrieval (UUM/HP-FL and UUM/HP-VL) are derived from this framework. Empirical studies have been conducted on testbeds to simulate the distributed search solutions of large organizations (companies) or domain-specific hidden Web. Furthermore, the UUM/HP-FL and UUM/HP-VL resource selection algorithms are extended with a variant of SSL results merging algorithm to address the distributed document retrieval task when selected databases do not return document scores. Experiments have shown that these algorithms achieve results that are at least as good as the prior state-of-the-art, and sometimes considerably better. Detailed analysis indicates that the advantage of these algorithms comes from explicitly optimizing the goals of the specific tasks. The unified utility maximization framework is open for different extensions. When cost is associated with searching the online databases, the utility framework can be adjusted to automatically estimate the best number of databases to search so that a large amount of relevant documents can be retrieved with relatively small costs. Another extension of the framework is to consider the retrieval effectiveness of the online databases, which is an important issue in the operational environments. All of these are the directions of future research. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research was supported by NSF grants EIA-9983253 and IIS-0118767.

School of Compute Science Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh, PA 15213 callan@cs.cmu.edu Resumen Este documento presenta un marco de utilidad unificado para la selección de recursos de la recuperación de información de texto distribuido. Este nuevo marco muestra una forma eficiente y efectiva de inferir las probabilidades de relevancia de todos los documentos en las bases de datos de texto. Con la información de relevancia estimada, la selección de recursos se puede hacer optimizando explícitamente los objetivos de diferentes aplicaciones. Específicamente, cuando se usa para la recomendación de la base de datos, la selección está optimizada para el objetivo de HighRecall (incluya tantos documentos relevantes como sea posible en las bases de datos seleccionadas);Cuando se usa para la recuperación de documentos distribuidos, la selección se dirige al objetivo de alta precisión (alta precisión en la lista final de documentos fusionados). Este nuevo modelo proporciona un marco más sólido para la recuperación de información distribuida. Los estudios empíricos muestran que es al menos tan efectivo como otros algoritmos de última generación. Categorías y descriptores de asignaturas H.3.3 [Búsqueda y recuperación de información]: Algoritmos de términos generales 1. Introducción Los motores de búsqueda convencionales como Google o Altavista utilizan una solución de recuperación de información ad-hoc suponiendo que todos los documentos de búsqueda se puedan copiar en una única base de datos centralizada con el propósito de indexación. La recuperación de información distribuida, también conocida como búsqueda federada [1,4,7,11,14,22] es diferente de la recuperación de información ad-hoc, ya que aborda los casos en que los documentos no se pueden adquirir y almacenar en una sola base de datos. Por ejemplo, los contenidos web ocultos (también llamados contenidos web invisibles o profundos) son información en la web a la que los motores de búsqueda convencionales no pueden acceder. Se ha estimado que los contenidos web ocultos son 2-50 [19] veces más grandes que los contenidos que pueden buscar en los motores de búsqueda convencionales. Por lo tanto, es muy importante buscar en este tipo de información valiosa. La arquitectura de la solución de búsqueda distribuida está altamente influenciada por diferentes características ambientales. En una pequeña red de área local, como entornos de pequeñas empresas, los proveedores de información pueden cooperar para proporcionar estadísticas de corpus o usar el mismo tipo de motores de búsqueda. La investigación de recuperación de información distribuida temprana se centró en este tipo de entornos cooperativos [1,8]. Por otro lado, en una red de área amplia, como entornos corporativos muy grandes o en la web, hay muchos tipos de motores de búsqueda y es difícil suponer que todos los proveedores de información pueden cooperar según sea necesario. Incluso si están dispuestos a cooperar en estos entornos, puede ser difícil hacer cumplir una solución única para todos los proveedores de información o para detectar si las fuentes de información proporcionan la información correcta según sea necesario. Muchas aplicaciones entran en el último tipo de entornos no cooperativos, como el Proyecto Mental [16] que integra bibliotecas digitales no cooperantes o el sistema Qprober [9] que admite la navegación y la búsqueda de bases de datos web ocultas no cooperativas. En este artículo, nos centramos principalmente en entornos no cooperativos que contienen múltiples tipos de motores de búsqueda independientes. Hay tres subproblemas importantes en la recuperación de información distribuida. Primero, se debe adquirir información sobre el contenido de cada base de datos individual (representación de recursos) [1,8,21]. En segundo lugar, dada una consulta, se debe seleccionar un conjunto de recursos para hacer la búsqueda (selección de recursos) [5,7,21]. En tercer lugar, los resultados recuperados de todos los recursos seleccionados deben fusionarse en una sola lista final antes de que pueda presentarse al usuario final (recuperación y fusión de resultados) [1,5,20,22]. Existen muchos tipos de soluciones para la recuperación de información distribuida. Invisible-web.net1 proporciona navegación guiada de bases de datos web ocultas mediante la recopilación de las descripciones de recursos de estas bases de datos y construyendo jerarquías de clases que las agrupan mediante temas similares. Un sistema de recomendación de la base de datos va un paso más allá de un sistema de navegación como invisible-web.net recomendando la mayoría de las fuentes de información relevantes para las consultas de los usuarios. Se compone de la descripción de recursos y los componentes de selección de recursos. Esta solución es útil cuando los usuarios desean explorar las bases de datos seleccionadas por sí mismos en lugar de pedirle al sistema que recupere los documentos relevantes automáticamente. La recuperación de documentos distribuidos es una tarea más sofisticada. Selecciona fuentes de información relevantes para consultas de usuarios como lo hace el sistema de recomendación de la base de datos. Además, las consultas de los usuarios se reenvían a las bases de datos seleccionadas correspondientes y las listas clasificadas individuales devueltas se fusionan en una lista única para presentar a los usuarios. El objetivo de un sistema de recomendación de base de datos es seleccionar un pequeño conjunto de recursos que contengan tantos documentos relevantes como sea posible, que llamamos un objetivo de alta recuperación. Por otro lado, la efectividad de la recuperación de documentos distribuidos a menudo se mide por la precisión de la lista final de resultados de documentos fusionados, que llamamos un objetivo de alta precisión. Investigaciones previas indicaron que estos dos objetivos están relacionados pero no idénticos [4,21]. Sin embargo, la mayoría de las soluciones anteriores simplemente utilizan un algoritmo efectivo de selección de recursos del sistema de recomendación de la base de datos para el sistema de recuperación de documentos distribuido o resuelven la inconsistencia con métodos heurísticos [1,4,21]. Este documento presenta un marco de maximización de utilidad unificado para integrar el problema de selección de recursos de la recomendación de la base de datos y la recuperación de documentos distribuidos juntos mediante el tratamiento de ellos como objetivos de optimización diferentes. Primero, una base de datos de muestra centralizada se crea muestras aleatorias de una pequeña cantidad de documentos de cada base de datos con muestreo basado en consultas [1];Las estadísticas de tamaño de la base de datos también se estiman [21]. Se aprende un modelo de transformación logística fuera de línea con una pequeña cantidad de consultas de entrenamiento para asignar los puntajes de documentos centralizados en la base de datos de muestra centralizada a las probabilidades de relevancia correspondientes. En segundo lugar, después de enviar una nueva consulta, la consulta se puede utilizar para buscar la base de datos de muestra centralizada que produce una puntuación para cada documento muestreado. La probabilidad de relevancia para cada documento en la base de datos de muestra centralizada se puede estimar aplicando el modelo logístico a cada puntaje de documentos. Luego, las probabilidades de relevancia de todos los documentos (en su mayoría invisibles) entre las bases de datos disponibles se pueden estimar utilizando las probabilidades de relevancia de los documentos en la base de datos de muestra centralizada y las estimaciones del tamaño de la base de datos. Para la tarea de selección de recursos para un sistema de recomendación de base de datos, las bases de datos pueden ser clasificadas por el número esperado de documentos relevantes para cumplir con el objetivo de alta recuperación. Para la selección de recursos para un sistema de recuperación de documentos distribuido, las bases de datos que contienen un pequeño número de documentos con grandes probabilidades de relevancia se favorecen sobre las bases de datos que contienen muchos documentos con pequeñas probabilidades de relevancia. Este criterio de selección cumple con el objetivo de alta precisión de la aplicación distribuida de recuperación de documentos. Además, el algoritmo de aprendizaje semi-supervisado (SSL) [20,22] se aplica para fusionar los documentos devueltos en una lista final clasificada. El marco de utilidad unificado hace muy pocos supuestos y funciona en entornos no cooperativos. Dos características clave lo convierten en un modelo más sólido para la recuperación de información distribuida: i) Formaliza los problemas de selección de recursos de diferentes aplicaciones como diversas funciones de utilidad, y optimiza las funciones de utilidad para lograr los resultados óptimos en consecuencia;y ii) muestra una forma efectiva y eficiente de estimar las probabilidades de relevancia de todos los documentos en todas las bases de datos. Específicamente, el marco construye modelos logísticos en la base de datos de muestra centralizada para transformar los puntajes de recuperación centralizados en las probabilidades de relevancia correspondientes y utiliza la base de datos de muestra centralizada como el puente entre las bases de datos individuales y el modelo logístico. El esfuerzo humano (juicio de relevancia) requerido para capacitar al modelo logístico centralizado único no se escala con el número de bases de datos. Esta es una gran ventaja sobre investigaciones anteriores, que requirió la cantidad de esfuerzo humano para ser lineal con el número de bases de datos [7,15]. El marco de utilidad unificado no solo es más teóricamente sólido sino también muy efectivo. Los estudios empíricos muestran que el nuevo modelo es al menos tan preciso como los algoritmos de última generación en una variedad de configuraciones. La siguiente sección discute el trabajo relacionado. La Sección 3 describe el nuevo modelo de maximización de utilidad unificado. La Sección 4 explica nuestra metodología experimental. Las secciones 5 y 6 presentan nuestros resultados experimentales para la selección de recursos y la recuperación de documentos. La sección 7 concluye.2. Investigación previa ha habido una investigación considerable sobre todos los subproblemas de la recuperación de información distribuida. Encuestamos el trabajo más relacionado en esta sección. El primer problema de recuperación de información distribuida es la representación de recursos. El protocolo de inicio es una solución para adquirir descripciones de recursos en entornos cooperativos [8]. Sin embargo, en entornos no cooperativos, incluso las bases de datos están dispuestas a compartir su información, no es fácil juzgar si la información que proporcionan es precisa o no. Además, no es fácil coordinar las bases de datos para proporcionar representaciones de recursos que sean compatibles entre sí. Por lo tanto, en entornos no cooperativos, una opción común es el muestreo basado en la consulta, que genera y envía consultas a los motores de búsqueda individuales y recupera algunos documentos para construir las descripciones. Como los documentos muestreados son seleccionados por consultas aleatorias, el muestreo basado en consultas no es fácilmente engañado por ningún spammer adversario que esté interesado en atraer más tráfico. Los experimentos han demostrado que se pueden construir descripciones de recursos bastante precisas enviando alrededor de 80 consultas y descargando unos 300 documentos [1]. Se han propuesto muchos algoritmos de selección de recursos como GGloss/VGloss [8] y Cori [1] en la última década. El algoritmo CORI representa cada base de datos por sus términos, las frecuencias del documento y un pequeño número de estadísticas de Corpus (detalles en [1]). Como la investigación previa en diferentes conjuntos de datos ha demostrado que el algoritmo CORI es el más estable y efectivo de los tres algoritmos [1,17,18], lo usamos como un algoritmo de referencia en este trabajo. El algoritmo de selección de recursos relevante de estimación de distribución de documentos (REDDE [21]) es un algoritmo reciente que intenta estimar la distribución de documentos relevantes en las bases de datos disponibles y clasifica las bases de datos en consecuencia. Aunque se ha demostrado que el algoritmo Redde es efectivo, se basa en constantes heurísticas que se establecen empíricamente [21]. El último paso del subproblema de recuperación de documentos es la fusión de resultados, que es el proceso de transformar las puntuaciones de documentos de 33 bases específicas de la base de datos en puntajes comparables de documentos independientes de la base de datos. El algoritmo de fusión de resultados semi supervisado (SSL) [20,22] utiliza los documentos adquiridos por muestreo basado en consultas como datos de entrenamiento y regresión lineal para aprender los modelos de fusión específicos de la base de datos específicos de la consulta. Estos modelos lineales se utilizan para convertir los puntajes de documentos específicos de la base de datos en los puntajes de documentos centralizados aproximados. Se ha demostrado que el algoritmo SSL es efectivo [22]. Sirve como un componente importante de nuestro marco de maximización de utilidad unificado (Sección 3). Para lograr resultados precisos de recuperación de documentos, muchos métodos anteriores simplemente utilizan algoritmos de selección de recursos que son efectivos del sistema de recomendación de la base de datos. Pero como se señaló anteriormente, un buen algoritmo de selección de recursos optimizado para alta recuperación puede no funcionar bien para la recuperación de documentos, lo que se dirige al objetivo de alta precisión. Este tipo de inconsistencia se ha observado en investigaciones anteriores [4,21]. La investigación en [21] trató de resolver el problema con un método heurístico. La investigación más similar a lo que proponemos aquí es el marco teórico de decisión (DTF) [7,15]. Este marco calcula una selección que minimiza los costos generales (por ejemplo, calidad de recuperación, tiempo) del sistema de recuperación de documentos y varios métodos [15] para estimar la calidad de la recuperación. Sin embargo, dos puntos distinguen nuestra investigación del modelo DTF. Primero, el DTF es un marco diseñado específicamente para la recuperación de documentos, pero nuestro nuevo modelo integra dos aplicaciones distintas con diferentes requisitos (recomendación de la base de datos y recuperación de documentos distribuidos) en el mismo marco unificado. En segundo lugar, el DTF crea un modelo para cada base de datos para calcular las probabilidades de relevancia. Esto requiere juicios de relevancia humana para los resultados recuperados de cada base de datos. En contraste, nuestro enfoque solo construye un modelo logístico para la base de datos de muestra centralizada. La base de datos de muestra centralizada puede servir como un puente para conectar las bases de datos individuales con el modelo logístico centralizado, por lo tanto, se pueden estimar las probabilidades de relevancia de los documentos en diferentes bases de datos. Esta estrategia puede ahorrar una gran cantidad de esfuerzo de juicio humano y es una gran ventaja del marco de maximización de la utilidad unificada sobre el DTF, especialmente cuando hay una gran cantidad de bases de datos.3. Marco de maximización de la utilidad unificada El marco de maximización de la utilidad unificada (UUM) se basa en estimar las probabilidades de relevancia de los documentos (en su mayoría invisibles) disponibles en el entorno de búsqueda distribuido. En esta sección describimos cómo se estiman las probabilidades de relevancia y cómo el modelo de maximización de utilidad unificado las usa. También describimos cómo el modelo se puede optimizar para el objetivo de alta recuperación de un sistema de recomendación de la base de datos y el objetivo de alta precisión de un sistema de recuperación de documentos distribuido.3.1 Estimación de probabilidades de relevancia Como se señaló anteriormente, el propósito de la selección de recursos es alto y el propósito de la recuperación de documentos es de alta precisión. Para cumplir con estos objetivos diversos, el tema clave es estimar las probabilidades de relevancia de los documentos en varias bases de datos. Este es un problema difícil porque solo podemos observar una muestra del contenido de cada base de datos utilizando el muestreo basado en consultas. Nuestra estrategia es hacer uso completo de toda la información disponible para calcular las estimaciones de probabilidad.3.1.1 Probabilidades de aprendizaje de relevancia En el paso de descripción de recursos, la base de datos de muestra centralizada se crea mediante un muestreo basado en consultas y los tamaños de base de datos se estiman utilizando el método de resumen de muestra [21]. Al mismo tiempo, se aplica un algoritmo de recuperación efectivo (investigación [2]) en la base de datos de muestra centralizada con un pequeño número (por ejemplo, 50) de consultas de capacitación. Para cada consulta de capacitación, el algoritmo de selección de recursos CORI [1] se aplica para seleccionar algún número (por ejemplo, 10) de bases de datos y recuperar 50 ID de documento de cada base de datos. El algoritmo de fusión de resultados SSL [20,22] se utiliza para fusionar los resultados. Luego, podemos descargar los 50 documentos principales en la lista final fusionada y calcular sus puntajes centralizados correspondientes utilizando la investigación y las estadísticas del corpus de la base de datos de muestra centralizada. Los puntajes centralizados se normalizan aún más (divididos por la puntuación centralizada máxima para cada consulta), ya que se ha sugerido este método para mejorar la precisión de la estimación en investigaciones anteriores [15]. El juicio humano se adquiere para esos documentos y se crea un modelo logístico para transformar los puntajes de documentos centralizados normalizados a probabilidades de relevancia de la siguiente manera: ()) (exp (1)) (exp (|) (_ _ DSBA DSBA DRELPDR CCC CCC++ + == (1) donde) (_ DSC es la puntuación de documento centralizada normalizada y AC y BC son los dos parámetros del modelo logístico. Estos dos parámetros se estiman maximizando las probabilidades de relevancia de las consultas de capacitación. El modelo logístico nos proporciona la herramienta para calcular las probabilidades de relevancia a partir de puntajes de documentos centralizados.3.1.2 Estimación de puntajes de documentos centralizados Cuando el usuario envía una nueva consulta, se calculan los puntajes de documentos centralizados de los documentos en la base de datos de muestra centralizada. Sin embargo, para calcular las probabilidades de relevancia, necesitamos estimar los puntajes de documentos centralizados para todos los documentos en las bases de datos en lugar de solo los documentos muestreados. Este objetivo se logra utilizando: las puntuaciones centralizadas de los documentos en la base de datos de muestra centralizada y las estadísticas de tamaño de la base de datos. Definimos el factor de escala de la base de datos para la base de datos IPH como la relación del tamaño estimado de la base de datos y el número de documentos muestreados de esta base de datos de la siguiente manera: ^ _ i i i db db db samp n sf n = (2) donde ^ idbn es el estimado estimadoEl tamaño de la base de datos y el SAMPN _IDB es el número de documentos de la base de datos IPH en la base de datos de muestra centralizada. La intuición detrás del factor de escala de la base de datos es que, para una base de datos cuyo factor de escala es 50, si un documento de esta base de datos en la base de datos de muestra centralizada tiene una puntuación de documento centralizada de 0.5, podemos suponer que hay alrededor de 50 documentos en esa base de datos.que tienen puntajes de aproximadamente 0.5. En realidad, podemos aplicar un método de interpolación lineal no paramétrico más fino para estimar la curva de puntaje de documento centralizado para cada base de datos. Formalmente, clasificamos todos los documentos muestreados de la base de datos IPH por sus puntajes centralizados del Documento 34 para obtener la lista de puntaje de documentos centralizados muestreados {SC (DSI1), SC (DSI2), SC (DSI3), ... ..};Suponemos que si pudiéramos calcular los puntajes de documentos centralizados para todos los documentos en esta base de datos y obtenga la lista completa de puntajes de documentos centralizados, el documento superior en la lista muestreada tendría un rango SFDBI/2, el segundo documento en la lista de muestras rangoSFDBI3/2, y así sucesivamente. Por lo tanto, los puntos de datos de los documentos muestreados en la lista completa son: {(sfdbi/2, sc (dsi1)), (sfdbi3/2, sc (dsi2)), (sfdbi5/2, sc (dsi3)), ....}. La interpolación lineal por partes se aplica para estimar la curva de puntaje de documento centralizado, como se ilustra en la Figura 1. La lista completa de puntaje de documentos centralizados se puede estimar calculando los valores de diferentes rangos en la curva de documento centralizado como:], 1 [,) (S ^^ c idbij njd ∈. Se puede ver en la Figura 1 que más puntos de datos de muestra producen estimaciones más precisas de las curvas de puntaje de documentos centralizados. Sin embargo, para bases de datos con grandes relaciones de escala de bases de datos, este tipo de interpolación lineal puede ser bastante inexacta, especialmente para los documentos más clasificados (por ejemplo, [1, SFDBI/2]). Por lo tanto, se propone una solución alternativa para estimar las puntuaciones de documentos centralizadas de los documentos clasificados para bases de datos con relaciones a gran escala (por ejemplo, mayores de 100). Específicamente, se crea un modelo logístico para cada una de estas bases de datos. El modelo logístico se utiliza para estimar la puntuación de documento centralizado del documento Top 1 en la base de datos correspondiente utilizando los dos documentos muestreados de esa base de datos con puntajes centralizados más altos.))

Para cada consulta de capacitación, se descarga el documento recuperado de cada base de datos y se calcula el puntaje de documento centralizado correspondiente. Junto con los puntajes de los dos principales documentos muestreados, estos parámetros se pueden estimar. Después de estimar la puntuación centralizada del documento superior, se ajusta una función exponencial para la parte superior ([1, SFDBI/2]) de la curva de puntaje de documento centralizado como:] 2/, 1 [)*exp () (10^ idbiiijc sfjjds ∈+= ββ (4) ^ 0 1 1Log (()) I C I es Dβ β = - (5)) 12/()) (log () ((log ( ^ 11 1 - - = IDB ICIC ISF DSDSS β (6) Los dos parámetros 0iβ y 1iβ están ajustados para asegurarse de que la función exponencial pase a través de los dos puntos (1, ^ 1) (IC DS) y (SFDBI/2, SC (DSI1)). La función exponencial solo se usa para ajustar la parte superior de la curva de puntuación de documento centralizada y la parte inferior de la curva todavía está equipada con el método de interpolación lineal descrito anteriormente. El ajuste al ajustar la función exponencial de los documentos mejor clasificados se ha demostrado empíricamente para producir resultados más precisos. Desde las curvas de puntaje de documentos centralizados, podemos estimar las listas completas de puntaje de documentos centralizados en consecuencia para todas las bases de datos disponibles. Después de que los puntajes de documentos centralizados estimados se normalizan, las listas completas de probabilidades de relevancia pueden construirse a partir de las listas de puntaje de documentos centralizados completos mediante la Ecuación 1. Formalmente para la base de datos IPH, la lista completa de probabilidades de relevancia es:], 1 [,) (r ^^ idbij njd ∈. 3.2 El modelo de maximización de utilidad unificado En esta sección, definimos formalmente el nuevo modelo de maximización de utilidad unificado queOptimiza los problemas de selección de recursos para dos objetivos de alta recuperación (recomendación de la base de datos) y de alta precisión (recuperación de documentos distribuidos) en el mismo marco. En la tarea de recomendación de la base de datos, el sistema debe decidir cómo clasificar las bases de datos. En la tarea de recuperación de documentos, el sistema no solo necesita seleccionar las bases de datos, sino que también necesita decidir cuántos documentos recuperar de cada base de datos seleccionada. Generalizamos el proceso de selección de recomendación de la base de datos, que recomienda implícitamente todos los documentos en cada base de datos seleccionada, como un caso especial de la decisión de selección para la tarea de recuperación de documentos. Formalmente, denotamos DI como el número de documentos que nos gustaría recuperar de la base de datos IPH y, .....}, {21 ddd = como una acción de selección para todas las bases de datos. La decisión de selección de la base de datos se toma en función de las listas completas de probabilidades de relevancia para todas las bases de datos. Las listas completas de probabilidades de relevancia se infieren de toda la información disponible específicamente SR, que representa las descripciones de recursos adquiridas por muestreo basado en la consulta y las estimaciones de tamaño de la base de datos adquiridas por resolución de muestras;CS significa los puntajes de documentos centralizados de los documentos en la base de datos de muestra centralizada. Si el método para estimar los puntajes de documentos centralizados y las probabilidades de relevancia en la Sección 3.1 es aceptable, entonces las listas completas más probables de probabilidades de relevancia pueden derivarse y las denotamos como 1 ^ ^ * 1 {(R (), [1,]), dbjd j nθ = ∈ 2 ^ ^ 2 (r (), [1,]), .......} dbjd j n∈. El vector aleatorio denota un conjunto arbitrario de listas completas de probabilidades de relevancia y), | (CS SRP θ como la probabilidad de generar este conjunto de listas. Finalmente, a cada acción de selección D y un conjunto de listas completas de la Figura 1. Construcción de interpolación lineal de la lista completa de puntajes de documentos centralizados (el factor de escala de base de datos es 50).35 Probabilidades de relevancia θ, asociamos una función de utilidad) (du θ que indica el beneficio de hacer la selección D cuando las verdaderas listas completas de probabilidades de relevancia son θ. Por lo tanto, la decisión de selección definida por el marco bayesiano es: θθθ θ dsrpdud cs d). | (), (Maxarg * = (7) un enfoque común para simplificar el cálculo en el marco bayesiano es calcular solo la función de utilidad en elLos valores de parámetros más probables en lugar de calcular toda la expectativa. En otras palabras, solo necesitamos calcular), ( * du θ y la ecuación 7 se simplifica de la siguiente manera :), (maxarg * * θdud d = (8) Esta ecuación sirve como el modelo básico tanto para el sistema de recomendación de la base de datos como para el sistema de recomendación de la base de datos como paraSistema de recuperación de documentos. 3.3 La selección de recursos para alta recuperación de alta recuperación es el objetivo del algoritmo de selección de recursos en tareas de búsqueda federada, como la recomendación de la base de datos. El objetivo es seleccionar un pequeño conjunto de recursos (por ejemplo, menos de las bases de datos NSDB) que contienen tantos documentos relevantes como sea posible, que se puede definir formalmente como: = = i n j iji idb ddidu ^ 1 ^ *) (r) (r)(), (θ (9) I (Di) es la función indicadora, que es 1 cuando la base de datos IPH se selecciona y 0 de lo contrario. Conecte esta ecuación en el modelo básico en la Ecuación 8 y asocie la restricción del número de base de datos seleccionada para obtener lo siguiente: SDB I I I N J IJI D NDITOSUBEXT DDID IDB = = =) (:) (R) (Maxarg ^ 1 ^* (10)La solución de este problema de optimización es muy simple. Podemos calcular el número esperado de documentos relevantes para cada base de datos de la siguiente manera: = = Idb I n J ijrd dn ^ 1 ^^) (r (11) Las bases de datos NSDB con el mayor número esperado de documentos relevantes pueden seleccionarse para cumplir con elMeta de alta recuperación. Llamamos a esto el algoritmo UUM/HR (maximización de utilidad unificada para alta recuperación).3.4 La selección de recursos para la alta precisión de alta precisión es el objetivo del algoritmo de selección de recursos en tareas de búsqueda federada, como la recuperación de documentos distribuidos. Se mide por la precisión en la parte superior de la lista final de documentos fusionados. Este criterio de alta precisión se realiza mediante la siguiente función de utilidad, que mide la precisión de los documentos recuperados de las bases de datos seleccionadas.= = i d j iji i ddidu 1 ^ *) (r) (), (θ (12) Tenga en cuenta que la diferencia clave entre la ecuación 12 y la ecuación 9 es que la ecuación 9 suma las probabilidades de relevancia de todos los documentos en una base de datos,mientras que la ecuación 12 solo considera una parte mucho más pequeña de la clasificación. Específicamente, podemos calcular la decisión de selección óptima de: = = I d J iji d i ddid 1 ^*) (r) (maxarg (13) diferentes tipos de restricciones causadas por diferentes características de las tareas de recuperación de documentos pueden asociarse con el problema de optimización anterior. El más común es seleccionar un número fijo (NSDB) de bases de datos y recuperar un número fijo (NRDOC) de documentos de cada base de datos seleccionada, definido formalmente como: 0,) (:) (R) (Maxarg 1 ^* ≠ = == = = Irdoci Sdb I I I D J IJI D Difnd nditosubject Ddid I (14) Este problema de optimización se puede resolver fácilmente calculando el número de documentos relevantes esperados en la parte superior de cada lista de datos completa de probabilidades de relevancia: = = RDOC I n n n NJ ijrdtop dn 1 ^^ _) (r (15) Entonces las bases de datos pueden clasificarse por estos valores y seleccionados. Llamamos a esto el algoritmo UUM/HP-FL (maximización de utilidad unificada para una alta precisión con clasificaciones de documentos de longitud fija de cada base de datos seleccionada). Una situación más compleja es variar el número de documentos recuperados de cada base de datos seleccionada. Más específicamente, permitimos que diferentes bases de datos seleccionadas devuelvan diferentes números de documentos. Para la simplificación, las longitudes de la lista de resultados deben ser múltiplos de un número de línea de base 10. (Este valor también puede variar, pero para la simplificación se establece en 10 en este documento). Esta restricción está configurada para simular el comportamiento de los motores de búsqueda comerciales en la web.(Los motores de búsqueda como Google y AltaVista devuelven solo 10 o 20 ID de documento para cada página de resultados). Este procedimiento ahorra el tiempo de cálculo de calcular la selección óptima de la base de datos al permitir que el paso de programación dinámica sea 10 en lugar de 1 (más detalles se discute más tarde). Para una simplificación adicional, restringimos a seleccionar en la mayoría de los 100 documentos de cada base de datos (di <= 100), entonces, el problema de optimización de selección se formaliza de la siguiente manera:] 10 .. ,, 2,1,0 [,*10) (::) (R) (maxarg _ 1 ^* ∈ = = = = = kkd nd nditosubject ddid i rdoctotal i i sdb i i i d j iji d i (16) ntotal_rdoc es el número total de documentos que se recuperarán. Desafortunadamente, no hay una solución simple para este problema de optimización, ya que hay para las ecuaciones 10 y 14. Sin embargo, se puede aplicar un algoritmo de programación dinámico 36 para calcular la solución óptima. Los pasos básicos de este método de programación dinámica se describen en la Figura 2. Como este algoritmo permite recuperar listas de resultados de longitudes variables de cada base de datos seleccionada, se llama algoritmo UUM/HP-VL. Después de tomar las decisiones de selección, se buscan las bases de datos seleccionadas y las ID de documento correspondientes se recuperan de cada base de datos. El último paso de la recuperación de documentos es fusionar los resultados devueltos en una lista de clasificación única con el algoritmo de aprendizaje semisuuficiente. Se señaló antes que el algoritmo SSL asigna los puntajes específicos de la base de datos en las puntuaciones de documentos centralizados y construye la lista final clasificada en consecuencia, lo que es consistente con todos nuestros procedimientos de selección donde documentos con mayores probabilidades de relevancia (por lo tanto, puntajes de documentos centralizados más altos)se seleccionan.4. Metodología experimental 4.1 Test Bacets Es deseable evaluar los algoritmos de recuperación de información distribuida con tallas de prueba que simulan estrechamente las aplicaciones del mundo real. Las colecciones web TREC WT2G o WT10G [4,13] proporcionan una forma de dividir documentos de diferentes servidores web. De esta manera, se podría crear un gran número (O (1000)) de bases de datos con contenidos bastante diversos, lo que puede hacer de este Testbed un buen candidato para simular los entornos operativos, como la web oculta de dominio abierto. Sin embargo, dos debilidad de esta prueba de prueba son: i) Cada base de datos contiene solo una pequeña cantidad de documento (259 documentos por promedio para WT2G) [4];y ii) el contenido de WT2G o WT10G se arrastran arbitrariamente de la web. No es probable que una base de datos web oculta proporcione páginas de inicio personales o páginas web que indican que las páginas están en construcción y no hay información útil. Estos tipos de páginas web están contenidas en los conjuntos de datos WT2G/WT10G. Por lo tanto, los datos web ruidosos no son similares a los de los contenidos de la base de datos web ocultas de alta calidad, que generalmente están organizados por expertos en dominios. Otra opción son las noticias del TREC/datos del gobierno [1,15,17, 18,21]. TREC News/Gobierno Datos se concentran en temas relativamente estrechos. En comparación con los datos web de TREC: i) Las noticias/documentos gubernamentales son mucho más similares a los contenidos proporcionados por una base de datos orientada al tema que una página web arbitraria, ii) una base de datos en este banco de pruebas es más grande que la de los datos web de TREC. Por promedio, una base de datos contiene miles de documentos, que es más realista que una base de datos de datos web TREC con aproximadamente 250 documentos. Como el contenido y los tamaños de las bases de datos en TREC News/Gobierno Testbed son más similares a los de una base de datos orientada al tema, es un buen candidato para simular los entornos de recuperación de información distribuidos de grandes organizaciones (empresas) o sitios web ocultos específicos de dominios, como West que proporciona acceso a bases de datos de texto legales, financieras y de noticias [3]. Como la mayoría de los sistemas de recuperación de información distribuida actuales se desarrollan para los entornos de grandes organizaciones (empresas) o la red oculta específica de dominios que no se elaboran en este trabajo, no se eligió en este trabajo. TREC123-100COL-BYSOURCE Testbed es uno de los TREC News/Gobierno Testbed más utilizado [1,15,17,21]. Fue elegido en este trabajo. También se utilizaron tres tallas en [21] con distribuciones de tamaño de base de datos sesgadas y diferentes tipos de distribuciones de documentos relevantes para dar una simulación más exhaustiva para entornos reales. TREC123-100COL-BYSOURCE: se crearon 100 bases de datos a partir de TREC CDS 1, 2 y 3. Fueron organizados por fuente y fecha de publicación [1]. Los tamaños de las bases de datos no están sesgados. Los detalles están en la Tabla 1. Tres tallas construidas en [21] se basaron en el TREC123-100ColbySource Testbed. Cada testbecho contiene muchas bases de datos pequeñas y dos grandes bases de datos creadas mediante la fusión de aproximadamente 10-20 bases de datos pequeñas juntas.

Se crearon dos grandes bases de datos fusionando 20 pequeñas bases de datos con el método de redondeo. Por lo tanto, las dos grandes bases de datos tienen documentos más relevantes debido a sus grandes tamaños, a pesar de que las densidades de los documentos relevantes son aproximadamente las mismas que las bases de datos pequeñas. TREC123-AP-WSJ-60COL (relevante): las 24 colecciones de Associated Press y las 16 colecciones de Wall Street Journal en la prueba TREC123-100COL-BySource se colapsaron en dos grandes bases de datos Apall y Wsjall. Las otras 60 colecciones quedaron sin cambios. Las bases de datos APALL y WSJALL tienen densidades más altas de documentos relevantes para las consultas TREC que las bases de datos pequeñas. Por lo tanto, las dos grandes bases de datos tienen muchos documentos más relevantes que las bases de datos pequeñas. TREC123-FR-DOE-81COL (no relevante): las 13 colecciones del Registro Federal y las 6 colecciones del Departamento de Energía en el TREC123-100COL-BySource Testbed se colapsaron en dos grandes bases de datos Fall y Doeall. Las otras 80 colecciones quedaron sin cambios. Las bases de datos Fall y Doeall tienen densidades más bajas de documentos relevantes para las consultas TREC que las bases de datos pequeñas, a pesar de que son mucho más grandes.Se crearon 100 consultas a partir de los campos de título de los temas de TREC 51-150. Las consultas 101-150 se usaron como consultas de entrenamiento y las consultas 51-100 se usaron como consultas de prueba (detalles en la Tabla 2).4.2 Motores de búsqueda En los entornos de recuperación de información distribuida no cooperativa de grandes organizaciones (empresas) o la web oculta específica de dominios, diferentes bases de datos pueden usar diferentes tipos de motores de búsqueda. Para simular el entorno de motor múltiple, se utilizaron tres tipos diferentes de motores de búsqueda en los experimentos: investigación [2], un modelo de lenguaje estadístico unigram con suavizado lineal [12,20] y un algoritmo de recuperación de TFIDF con peso LTC [12,20]. Todos estos algoritmos se implementaron con el kit de herramientas Lemur [12]. Estos tres tipos de motores de búsqueda se asignaron a las bases de datos entre las cuatro bolas de prueba de manera redonda.5. Resultados: la selección de recursos de la recomendación de la base de datos Las cuatro bolas de prueba descritas en la Sección 4 se utilizaron en los experimentos para evaluar la efectividad de la selección de recursos del sistema de recomendación de la base de datos. Las descripciones de recursos se crearon utilizando muestreo basado en consultas. Se enviaron alrededor de 80 consultas a cada base de datos para descargar 300 documentos únicos. Las estadísticas de tamaño de la base de datos se estimaron mediante el método de resumen de muestra [21]. Se utilizaron cincuenta consultas (101-150) como consultas de capacitación para construir el modelo logístico relevante y para adaptarse a las funciones exponenciales de las curvas de puntaje de documentos centralizados para bases de datos de relaciones grandes (detalles en la Sección 3.1). Otras 50 consultas (51-100) se usaron como datos de prueba. Los algoritmos de selección de recursos de los sistemas de recomendación de la base de datos se comparan típicamente utilizando el NR métrico de recuperación [1,17,18,21]. Sea B denotar una clasificación de línea de base, que a menudo es el RBR (clasificación basada en la relevancia), y E como una clasificación proporcionada por un algoritmo de selección de recursos. Y deje que BI y EI denoten el número de documentos relevantes en la base de datos clasificada de B o E. Entonces RN se define de la siguiente manera: = = = K I I K I I K B E R 1 1 (17) Por lo general, el objetivo es buscar solo unas pocas bases de datos, por lo queNuestras cifras solo muestran resultados para seleccionar hasta 20 bases de datos. Los experimentos resumidos en la Figura 3 compararon la efectividad de los tres algoritmos de selección de recursos, a saber, los Cori, Redde y UUM/HR. El algoritmo UUM/HR se describe en la Sección 3.3. Se puede ver en la Figura 3 que los algoritmos Redde y UUM/HR son más efectivos (en los tallas de prueba Representantes, relevantes y no relevantes) o tan buenos como (en el TREC123-100Col Testbed) el algoritmo de selección de recursos CORI. El algoritmo UUM/HR es más efectivo que el algoritmo REDDE en el representante y los bacos de prueba relevantes y es casi el mismo que el algoritmo Redde en el TREC123100col y las tallas de pruebas no relevantes. Esto sugiere que el algoritmo UUM/HR es más robusto que el algoritmo Redde. Cabe señalar que al seleccionar solo unas pocas bases de datos en el TREC123-100col o las bases de pruebas no relacionadas, el algoritmo redee tiene una pequeña ventaja sobre el algoritmo UUM/HR. Atribuimos esto a dos causas: i) el algoritmo Redde se sintonizó en el TREC123-100col Testbed;y ii) aunque la diferencia es pequeña, esto puede sugerir que nuestro modelo logístico de estimación de probabilidades de relevancia no es lo suficientemente precisa. Más datos de entrenamiento o un modelo más sofisticado pueden ayudar a resolver este rompecabezas menor. Colecciones seleccionadas. Colecciones seleccionadas. TREC123-100COL Testbed.

Experimentos de selección de recursos en las cuatro bolas de prueba.38 6. Resultados: la efectividad de la recuperación de documentos para la recuperación del documento, se buscan las bases de datos seleccionadas y los resultados devueltos se fusionan en una sola lista final. En todos los experimentos discutidos en esta sección, los resultados recuperados de las bases de datos individuales fueron combinados por el algoritmo de fusión de resultados semisuuperados de aprendizaje. Esta versión del algoritmo SSL [22] puede descargar un pequeño número de textos de documentos devueltos sobre la mosca para crear datos de capacitación adicionales en el proceso de aprendizaje de los modelos lineales que mapean las puntuaciones de documentos específicas de la base de datos en puntajes de documentos centralizados estimados. Se ha demostrado que es muy efectivo en entornos donde solo se recuperan las listas de resultados cortas de cada base de datos seleccionada [22]. Este es un escenario común en entornos operativos y fue el caso de nuestros experimentos. La efectividad de la recuperación de documentos se midió por precisión en la parte superior de la lista final de documentos. Los experimentos en esta sección se realizaron para estudiar la efectividad de la recuperación del documento de cinco algoritmos de selección, a saber, los algoritmos Cori, Redde, Uum/HR, UUM/HP-FL y UUM/HP-VL. Los últimos tres algoritmos se propusieron en la Sección 3. Los primeros cuatro algoritmos seleccionaron 3 o 5 bases de datos, y se recuperaron 50 documentos de cada base de datos seleccionada. El algoritmo UUM/HP-FL también seleccionó 3 o 5 bases de datos, pero se permitió ajustar el número de documentos para recuperar de cada base de datos seleccionada;El número recuperado se limitó a ser de 10 a 100, y un múltiplo de 10.

Las tablas 3 y 4 muestran los resultados en el TREC123-100col Testbed, y las tablas 5 y 6 muestran los resultados en el Bed de la prueba representativa. En el TREC123-100col Testbed, la efectividad de la recuperación del documento del algoritmo de selección de Cori es aproximadamente el mismo o un poco mejor que el algoritmo Redde, pero ambos son peores que los otros tres algoritmos (tablas 3 y 4). El algoritmo UUM/HR tiene una pequeña ventaja sobre los algoritmos Cori y Redde. Antes se señaló una diferencia principal entre el algoritmo UUM/HR y el algoritmo Redde: el UUM/HR utiliza datos de entrenamiento e interpolación lineal para estimar las curvas de puntaje de documento centralizado, mientras que el algoritmo Redde [21] usa un método heurístico, supone que elLas curvas de puntaje de documentos centralizadas son funciones de paso y no se distinguen entre la parte superior de las curvas. Esta diferencia hace que UUM/HR sea mejor que el algoritmo Redde al distinguir documentos con altas probabilidades de relevancia de las bajas probabilidades de relevancia. Por lo tanto, el UUM/HR refleja el objetivo de recuperación de alta precisión mejor que el algoritmo Redde y, por lo tanto, es más efectivo para la recuperación de documentos. El algoritmo UUM/HR no optimiza explícitamente la decisión de selección con respecto al objetivo de alta precisión, ya que los algoritmos UUM/HP-FL y UUM/HP-VL están diseñados para hacer. Se puede ver que en este tallbed, los algoritmos UUM/HP-FL y UUM/HP-VL son mucho más efectivos que todos los demás algoritmos. Esto indica que su poder proviene de optimizar explícitamente el objetivo de alta precisión de la recuperación de documentos en las ecuaciones 14 y 16. En el Bed de prueba representativo, Cori es mucho menos efectivo que otros algoritmos para la recuperación de documentos distribuidos (Tablas 5 y 6). Los resultados de recuperación del documento del algoritmo Redde son mejores que los del algoritmo Cori, pero aún peores que los resultados del algoritmo UUM/HR. En esta prueba, los tres algoritmos UUM son igualmente efectivos. El análisis detallado muestra que la superposición de las bases de datos seleccionadas entre los algoritmos UUM/HR, UUM/HP-FL y UUM/HP-VL es mucho más grande que los experimentos en el Bed de prueba TREC123-100COL, ya que todos ellos tienden a seleccionar los dosgrandes bases de datos. Esto explica por qué son igualmente efectivos para la recuperación de documentos. En entornos operativos reales, las bases de datos pueden no devolver puntajes de documentos e informar solo listas de resultados clasificadas. Como el modelo de maximización de utilidad unificado solo utiliza puntajes de recuperación de documentos muestreados con un algoritmo de recuperación centralizado para calcular las probabilidades de relevancia, toma decisiones de selección de bases de datos sin referirse a los puntajes de documentos de bases de datos individuales y puede generalizarse fácilmente a este caso de listas de rango de rangosin puntajes de documentos. El único ajuste es que el algoritmo SSL fusiona las listas clasificadas sin puntajes de documentos al asignar los documentos con puntajes de pseudo-documento normalizados para sus rangos (en una lista clasificada de 50 documentos, el primero tiene un puntaje de 1, el segundo tiene una puntuación.de 0.98 etc.), que se ha estudiado en [22]. Los resultados del experimento en TREC123-100COL-BySource Testbed con 3 bases de datos seleccionadas se muestran en la Tabla 7. La configuración del experimento fue la misma que antes, excepto que los puntajes del documento se eliminaron intencionalmente y las bases de datos seleccionadas solo devuelven listas clasificadas de ID de documento. Se puede ver en los resultados que el UUM/HP-FL y UUM/HP-VL funcionan bien con bases de datos que no devuelven los puntajes de documentos y aún son más efectivos que otras alternativas. No se informan otros experimentos con bases de datos que no devuelven los puntajes de documentos, pero muestran resultados similares para demostrar la efectividad de los algoritmos UUM/HP-FL y UUM/HPVL. Los experimentos anteriores sugieren que es muy importante optimizar el objetivo de alta precisión explícitamente en la recuperación de documentos. Los nuevos algoritmos basados en este principio logran mejores o al menos buenos resultados como los algoritmos de última generación en varios entornos.7. Conclusión La recuperación de información distribuida resuelve el problema de encontrar información dispersa entre muchas bases de datos de texto en redes de área local e internets. La mayoría de las investigaciones previas utilizan algoritmo efectivo de selección de recursos del sistema de recomendación de la base de datos para la aplicación de recuperación de documentos distribuidos. Argumentamos que el objetivo de selección de recursos de alta recuperación de la recomendación de la base de datos y el objetivo de alta precisión de la recuperación de documentos están relacionados pero no idénticos. Este tipo de inconsistencia también se ha observado en trabajos anteriores, pero las soluciones anteriores utilizaron métodos heurísticos o cooperación asumida por bases de datos individuales (por ejemplo, todas las bases de datos utilizaron el mismo tipo de motores de búsqueda), lo que con frecuencia no es cierto en el entorno no cooperativo. En este trabajo, proponemos un modelo de maximización de utilidad unificado para integrar la selección de recursos de la recomendación de la base de datos y las tareas de recuperación de documentos en un solo marco unificado. En este marco, las decisiones de selección se obtienen optimizando diferentes funciones objetivas. Hasta donde sabemos, este es el primer trabajo que intenta ver y modelar teóricamente la tarea de recuperación de información distribuida de manera integrada. El nuevo marco continúa una tendencia de investigación reciente que estudia el uso de muestreo basado en consultas y una base de datos de muestra centralizada. Un solo modelo logístico fue entrenado en la tabla centralizada 7.

Por lo tanto, las probabilidades de relevancia para todos los documentos en las bases de datos se pueden estimar con una cantidad muy pequeña de juicio de relevancia humana, que es mucho más eficiente que los métodos anteriores que crean un modelo separado para cada base de datos. Este marco no solo es más teóricamente sólido sino también muy efectivo. Un algoritmo para la selección de recursos (UUM/HR) y dos algoritmos para la recuperación de documentos (UUM/HP-FL y UUM/HP-VL) se derivan de este marco. Se han realizado estudios empíricos en tallas para simular las soluciones de búsqueda distribuidas de grandes organizaciones (empresas) o la web oculta específica del dominio. Además, los algoritmos de selección de recursos UUM/HP-FL y UUM/HP-VL se extienden con una variante de resultados de fusión de resultados SSL para abordar la tarea de recuperación de documentos distribuidos cuando las bases de datos seleccionadas no devuelven los puntajes de los documentos. Los experimentos han demostrado que estos algoritmos logran resultados que son al menos tan buenos como el estado de arte anterior y, a veces, considerablemente mejor. El análisis detallado indica que la ventaja de estos algoritmos proviene de optimizar explícitamente los objetivos de las tareas específicas. El marco de maximización de utilidad unificado está abierto para diferentes extensiones. Cuando el costo se asocia con la búsqueda de las bases de datos en línea, el marco de servicios públicos se puede ajustar para estimar automáticamente el mejor número de bases de datos para buscar para que se pueda recuperar una gran cantidad de documentos relevantes con costos relativamente pequeños. Otra extensión del marco es considerar la efectividad de la recuperación de las bases de datos en línea, que es un tema importante en los entornos operativos.

        "Distributed information retrieval, also known as federated search [1,4,7,11,14,22] is different from ad-hoc information retrieval as it addresses the cases when documents cannot be acquired and stored in a single database.",
        "For example, Hidden Web contents (also called invisible or deep Web contents) are information on the Web that cannot be accessed by the conventional search engines.",
        "Hidden web contents have been estimated to be 2-50 [19] times larger than the contents that can be searched by conventional search engines.",
        "Therefore, it is very important to search this type of valuable information.",
        "The architecture of distributed search solution is highly influenced by different environmental characteristics.",
        "In a small local area network such as small company environments, the information providers may cooperate to provide corpus statistics or use the same type of search engines.",
        "Early distributed information retrieval research focused on this type of cooperative environments [1,8].",
        "On the other side, in a wide area network such as very large corporate environments or on the Web there are many types of search engines and it is difficult to assume that all the information providers can cooperate as they are required.",
        "Even if they are willing to cooperate in these environments, it may be hard to enforce a single solution for all the information providers or to detect whether information sources provide the correct information as they are required.",
        "Many applications fall into the latter type of uncooperative environments such as the Mind project [16] which integrates non-cooperating digital libraries or the QProber system [9] which supports browsing and searching of uncooperative hidden Web databases.",
        "In this paper, we focus mainly on uncooperative environments that contain multiple types of independent search engines.",
        "There are three important sub-problems in distributed information retrieval.",
        "First, information about the contents of each individual database must be acquired (resource representation) [1,8,21].",
        "Second, given a query, a set of resources must be selected to do the search (resource selection) [5,7,21].",
        "Third, the results retrieved from all the selected resources have to be merged into a single final list before it can be presented to the end user (retrieval and results merging) [1,5,20,22].",
        "Many types of solutions exist for distributed information retrieval.",
        "Invisible-web.net1 provides guided browsing of hidden Web databases by collecting the resource descriptions of these databases and building hierarchies of classes that group them by similar topics.",
        "A database recommendation system goes a step further than a browsing system like Invisible-web.net by recommending most relevant information sources to users queries.",
        "It is composed of the resource description and the resource selection components.",
        "This solution is useful when the users want to browse the selected databases by themselves instead of asking the system to retrieve relevant documents automatically.",
        "Distributed document retrieval is a more sophisticated task.",
        "It selects relevant information sources for users queries as the database recommendation system does.",
        "Furthermore, users queries are forwarded to the corresponding selected databases and the returned individual ranked lists are merged into a single list to present to the users.",
        "The goal of a database recommendation system is to select a small set of resources that contain as many relevant documents as possible, which we call a high-recall goal.",
        "On the other side, the effectiveness of distributed document retrieval is often measured by the Precision of the final merged document result list, which we call a high-precision goal.",
        "Prior research indicated that these two goals are related but not identical [4,21].",
        "However, most previous solutions simply use effective resource selection algorithm of database recommendation system for distributed document retrieval system or solve the inconsistency with heuristic methods [1,4,21].",
        "This paper presents a unified utility maximization framework to integrate the resource selection problem of both database recommendation and distributed document retrieval together by treating them as different optimization goals.",
        "First, a centralized sample database is built by randomly sampling a small amount of documents from each database with query-based sampling [1]; database size statistics are also estimated [21].",
        "A logistic transformation model is learned off line with a small amount of training queries to map the centralized document scores in the centralized sample database to the corresponding probabilities of relevance.",
        "Second, after a new query is submitted, the query can be used to search the centralized sample database which produces a score for each sampled document.",
        "The probability of relevance for each document in the centralized sample database can be estimated by applying the logistic model to each documents score.",
        "Then, the probabilities of relevance of all the (mostly unseen) documents among the available databases can be estimated using the probabilities of relevance of the documents in the centralized sample database and the database size estimates.",
        "For the task of resource selection for a database recommendation system, the databases can be ranked by the expected number of relevant documents to meet the high-recall goal.",
        "For resource selection for a distributed document retrieval system, databases containing a small number of documents with large probabilities of relevance are favored over databases containing many documents with small probabilities of relevance.",
        "This selection criterion meets the high-precision goal of distributed document retrieval application.",
        "Furthermore, the Semi-supervised learning (SSL) [20,22] algorithm is applied to merge the returned documents into a final ranked list.",
        "The unified utility framework makes very few assumptions and works in uncooperative environments.",
        "Two key features make it a more solid model for distributed information retrieval: i) It formalizes the resource selection problems of different applications as various utility functions, and optimizes the utility functions to achieve the optimal results accordingly; and ii) It shows an effective and efficient way to estimate the probabilities of relevance of all documents across databases.",
        "Specifically, the framework builds logistic models on the centralized sample database to transform centralized retrieval scores to the corresponding probabilities of relevance and uses the centralized sample database as the bridge between individual databases and the logistic model.",
        "The human effort (relevance judgment) required to train the single centralized logistic model does not scale with the number of databases.",
        "This is a large advantage over previous research, which required the amount of human effort to be linear with the number of databases [7,15].",
        "The unified utility framework is not only more theoretically solid but also very effective.",

        "The STARTS protocol is one solution for acquiring resource descriptions in cooperative environments [8].",
        "However, in uncooperative environments, even the databases are willing to share their information, it is not easy to judge whether the information they provide is accurate or not.",
        "Furthermore, it is not easy to coordinate the databases to provide resource representations that are compatible with each other.",
        "Thus, in uncooperative environments, one common choice is query-based sampling, which randomly generates and sends queries to individual search engines and retrieves some documents to build the descriptions.",
        "As the sampled documents are selected by random queries, query-based sampling is not easily fooled by any adversarial spammer that is interested to attract more traffic.",
        "Experiments have shown that rather accurate resource descriptions can be built by sending about 80 queries and downloading about 300 documents [1].",
        "Many resource selection algorithms such as gGlOSS/vGlOSS [8] and CORI [1] have been proposed in the last decade.",
        "The CORI algorithm represents each database by its terms, the document frequencies and a small number of corpus statistics (details in [1]).",
        "As prior research on different datasets has shown the CORI algorithm to be the most stable and effective of the three algorithms [1,17,18], we use it as a baseline algorithm in this work.",
        "The relevant document distribution estimation (ReDDE [21]) resource selection algorithm is a recent algorithm that tries to estimate the distribution of relevant documents across the available databases and ranks the databases accordingly.",

        "However, two points distinguish our research from the DTF model.",
        "First, the DTF is a framework designed specifically for document retrieval, but our new model integrates two distinct applications with different requirements (database recommendation and distributed document retrieval) into the same unified framework.",
        "Second, the DTF builds a model for each database to calculate the probabilities of relevance.",
        "This requires human relevance judgments for the results retrieved from each database.",

        "UNIFIED UTILITY MAXIMIZATION FRAMEWORK The Unified Utility Maximization (UUM) framework is based on estimating the probabilities of relevance of the (mostly unseen) documents available in the distributed search environment.",
        "In this section we describe how the probabilities of relevance are estimated and how they are used by the Unified Utility Maximization model.",
        "We also describe how the model can be optimized for the high-recall goal of a database recommendation system and the high-precision goal of a distributed document retrieval system. 3.1 Estimating Probabilities of Relevance As pointed out above, the purpose of resource selection is highrecall and the purpose of document retrieval is high-precision.",
        "In order to meet these diverse goals, the key issue is to estimate the probabilities of relevance of the documents in various databases.",
        "This is a difficult problem because we can only observe a sample of the contents of each database using query-based sampling.",
        "Our strategy is to make full use of all the available information to calculate the probability estimates. 3.1.1 Learning Probabilities of Relevance In the resource description step, the centralized sample database is built by query-based sampling and the database sizes are estimated using the sample-resample method [21].",
        "At the same time, an effective retrieval algorithm (Inquery [2]) is applied on the centralized sample database with a small number (e.g., 50) of training queries.",
        "For each training query, the CORI resource selection algorithm [1] is applied to select some number (e.g., 10) of databases and retrieve 50 document ids from each database.",
        "The SSL results merging algorithm [20,22] is used to merge the results.",
        "Then, we can download the top 50 documents in the final merged list and calculate their corresponding centralized scores using Inquery and the corpus statistics of the centralized sample database.",
        "The centralized scores are further normalized (divided by the maximum centralized score for each query), as this method has been suggested to improve estimation accuracy in previous research [15].",
        "Human judgment is acquired for those documents and a logistic model is built to transform the normalized centralized document scores to probabilities of relevance as follows: ( ) ))(exp(1 ))(exp( |)( _ _ dSba dSba drelPdR ccc ccc ++ + == (1) where )( _ dSc is the normalized centralized document score and ac and bc are the two parameters of the logistic model.",
        "These two parameters are estimated by maximizing the probabilities of relevance of the training queries.",
        "The logistic model provides us the tool to calculate the probabilities of relevance from centralized document scores. 3.1.2 Estimating Centralized Document Scores When the user submits a new query, the centralized document scores of the documents in the centralized sample database are calculated.",
        "However, in order to calculate the probabilities of relevance, we need to estimate centralized document scores for all documents across the databases instead of only the sampled documents.",
        "This goal is accomplished using: the centralized scores of the documents in the centralized sample database, and the database size statistics.",
        "We define the database scale factor for the ith database as the ratio of the estimated database size and the number of documents sampled from this database as follows: ^ _ i i i db db db samp N SF N = (2) where ^ idbN is the estimated database size and _idb sampN is the number of documents from the ith database in the centralized sample database.",
        "The intuition behind the database scale factor is that, for a database whose scale factor is 50, if one document from this database in the centralized sample database has a centralized document score of 0.5, we may guess that there are about 50 documents in that database which have scores of about 0.5.",
        "Actually, we can apply a finer non-parametric linear interpolation method to estimate the centralized document score curve for each database.",
        "Formally, we rank all the sampled documents from the ith database by their centralized document 34 scores to get the sampled centralized document score list {Sc(dsi1), Sc(dsi2), Sc(dsi3),…..} for the ith database; we assume that if we could calculate the centralized document scores for all the documents in this database and get the complete centralized document score list, the top document in the sampled list would have rank SFdbi/2, the second document in the sampled list would rank SFdbi3/2, and so on.",
        "Therefore, the data points of sampled documents in the complete list are: {(SFdbi/2, Sc(dsi1)), (SFdbi3/2, Sc(dsi2)), (SFdbi5/2, Sc(dsi3)),…..}.",
        "Piecewise linear interpolation is applied to estimate the centralized document score curve, as illustrated in Figure 1.",

        "Therefore, an alternative solution is proposed to estimate the centralized document scores of the top ranked documents for databases with large scale ratios (e.g., larger than 100).",
        "Specifically, a logistic model is built for each of these databases.",

                "Our strategy is to make full use of all the available information to calculate the probability estimates. 3.1.1 Learning Probabilities of Relevance In the resource description step, the centralized sample database is built by query-based sampling and the database sizes are estimated using the sample-resample method [21].",
                "At the same time, an effective retrieval algorithm (Inquery [2]) is applied on the centralized sample database with a small number (e.g., 50) of training queries.",

                "The intuition behind the database scale factor is that, for a database whose scale factor is 50, if one document from this database in the centralized sample database has a centralized document score of 0.5, we may guess that there are about 50 documents in that database which have scores of about 0.5.",
                "Actually, we can apply a finer non-parametric linear interpolation method to estimate the centralized document score curve for each database.",

                "Therefore, the data points of sampled documents in the complete list are: {(SFdbi/2, Sc(dsi1)), (SFdbi3/2, Sc(dsi2)), (SFdbi5/2, Sc(dsi3)),…..}.",
