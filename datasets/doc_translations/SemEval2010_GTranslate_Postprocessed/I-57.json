Our starting point is to consider an agent attempting to estimate the utility of a contract, and we show that this leads to a model of computational trust whereby an agent must determine a vector of estimates that represent the probability that any dimension of the contract will be successfully fulfilled, and a covariance matrix that describes the uncertainty and correlations in these probabilities. We present a formalism based on the Dirichlet distribution that allows an agent to calculate these probabilities and correlations from their direct experience of contract outcomes, and we show that this leads to superior estimates compared to an alternative approach using multiple independent beta distributions. We then show how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to communicate and fuse reputation within a decentralised reputation system. Finally, we present a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within such systems. This solution uses the notion of private and shared information, and provides estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding bias and overconfidence.

INTRODUCTION The role of computational models of trust within multi-agent systems in particular, and open distributed systems in general, has recently generated a great deal of research interest. In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments. To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review). Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11]. This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means. In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents. Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety). However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7]. This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made. Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations. For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity. A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time. Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension. To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details). To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts. The starting point for our work is to consider how an agent can estimate the utility that it will derive from interacting with a supplier. Here we use standard approaches from the literature of data fusion (since this is a well developed field where the notion of multi-dimensional correlated estimates is well established1 ) to show that this naturally leads to a trust model where the agent must estimate probabilities and correlations over 1 In this context, the multiple dimensions typically represent the physical coordinates of a target being tracked, and correlations arise through the operation and orientation of sensors. 1070 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS multiple dimensions. Building upon this, we then devise a novel trust model that addresses the three desiderata discussed above. In more detail, in this paper we extend the state of the art in four key ways: 1. We devise a novel multi-dimensional probabilistic trust model that enables an agent to estimate the expected utility of a contract, by estimating (i) the probability that each contract dimension will be successfully fulfilled, and (ii) the correlations between these estimates. 2. We present an exact probabilistic model based upon the Dirichlet distribution that allows agents to use their direct experience of contract outcomes to calculate the probabilities and correlations described above. We then benchmark this solution and show that it leads to good estimates. 3. We show that agents can use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution in order to exchange reputation reports with one another. The sufficient statistics represent aggregations of their direct experience, and thus, express contract outcomes in a compact format with no loss of information. 4. We show that, while being efficient, the aggregation of contract outcomes can lead to double counting, and rumour propagation, in decentralised reputation systems. Thus, we present a novel solution based upon the idea of private and shared information. We show that it yields estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding overconfidence. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: in section 2 we review related work. In section 3 we present our notation for a single dimensional contract, before introducing our multi-dimensional trust model in section 4. In sections 5 and 6 we discuss communicating reputation, and present our solution to rumour propagation in decentralised reputation systems. We conclude in section 7. 2. RELATED WORK The need for a multi-dimensional trust model has been recognised by a number of researchers. Sabater and Sierra present a model of reputation, in which agents form contracts based on multiple variables (such as delivery date and quality), and define impressions as subjective evaluations of the outcome of these contracts. They provide heuristic approaches to combining these impressions to form a measure they call subjective reputation. Likewise, Griffiths decomposes overall trust into a number of different dimensions such as success, cost, timeliness and quality [4]. In his case, each dimension is scored as a real number that represents a comparative value with no strong semantic meaning. He develops an heuristic rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers. Whilst, he comments that the trust values could have some associated confidence level, heuristics for updating these levels are not presented. Gujral et al. take a similar approach and present a trust model over multiple domain specific dimensions [5]. They define multidimensional goal requirements, and evaluate an expected payoff based on a suppliers estimated behaviour. These estimates are, however, simple aggregations over the direct experience of several agents, and there is no measure of the uncertainty. Nevertheless, they show that agents who select suppliers based on these multiple dimensions outperform those who consider just a single one. By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension. Jøsang and Ismail describe the Beta Reputation System whereby the reputation of an agent is compiled from the positive and negative reports from other agents who have interacted with it [6]. The beta distribution represents a natural choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a principled means of representing uncertainty. Moreover, they provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques to deal with reputations that may change over time. Likewise, Teacy et al. use the beta distribution to describe an agents belief in the probability that another agent will successfully fulfill its commitments [11]. They present a formalism using a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other agents. They provide a number of extensions to this initial model, and, in particular, they consider that agents may not always truthfully report their trust estimates. Thus, they present a principled approach to detecting and removing inconsistent reports. Our work builds upon these more principled approaches. However, the starting point of our approach is to consider an agent that is attempting to estimate the expected utility of a contract. We show that estimating this expected utility requires that an agent must estimate the probability with which the supplier will fulfill its contract. In the single-dimensional case, this naturally leads to a trust model using the beta distribution (as per Jøsang and Ismail and Teacy et al.). However, we then go on to extend this analysis to multiple dimensions, where we use the natural extension of the beta distribution, namely the Dirichlet distribution, to represent the agents belief over multiple dimensions. 3. SINGLE-DIMENSIONAL TRUST Before presenting our multi-dimensional trust model, we first introduce the notation and formalism that we will use by describing the more familiar single dimensional case. We consider an agent who must decide whether to engage in a future contract with a supplier. This contract will lead to some outcome, o, and we consider that o = 1 if the contract is successfully fulfilled, and o = 0 if not2 . In order for the agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract. We assume that in the case that the contract is successfully fulfilled, the agent derives a utility u(o = 1), otherwise it receives no utility3 . Now, given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the supplier will fulfill the contract, it should consider the expected utility that it will derive, E[U], and this is given by: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) where p(o = 1) is the probability that the supplier will successfully fulfill the contract. However, whilst u(o = 1) is known by the agent, p(o = 1) is not. The best the agent can do is to determine a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct experience of previous contract outcomes. Given that it has been able to do so, it can then determine an estimate of the expected utility4 of the contract, E[E[U]], and a measure of its uncertainty in this expected utility, Var(E[U]). This uncertainty is important since a risk averse agent may make a decision regarding a contract, 2 Note that we only consider binary contract outcomes, although extending this to partial outcomes is part of our future work. 3 Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is derived from an unsuccessful outcome. 4 Note that this is often called the expected expected utility, and this is the notation that we adopt here [2]. The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1071 not only on its estimate of the expected utility of the contract, but also on the probability that the expected utility will exceed some minimum amount. These two properties are given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) where ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) are the estimate and uncertainty of the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, and are calculated from the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) that the agent determines from its direct experience. The utility based approach that we present here provides an attractive motivation for this model of Teacy et al. [11]. Now, in the case of binary contract outcomes, the beta distribution is the natural choice to represent the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) since within Bayesian statistics this well known to be the conjugate prior for binomial observations [3]. By adopting the beta distribution, we can calculate ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) using standard results, and thus, if an agent observed N previous contracts of which n were successfully fulfilled, then: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 and: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Note that as expected, the greater the number of contracts the agent observes, the smaller the variance term Var(p(o = 1)), and, thus, the less the uncertainty regarding the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1). 4. MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TRUST We now extend the description above, to consider contracts between suppliers and agents that are represented by multiple dimensions, and hence the success or failure of a contract can be decomposed into the success or failure of each separate dimension. Consider again the example of the supply chain that specifies the timeliness, quantity, and quality of the goods that are to be delivered. Thus, within our trust model oa = 1 now indicates a successful outcome over dimension a of the contract and oa = 0 indicates an unsuccessful one. A contract outcome, X, is now composed of a vector of individual contract part outcomes (e.g. X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .}). Given a multi-dimensional contract whose outcome is described by the vector X, we again consider that in order for an agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract. To this end, we can make the general statement that the expected utility of a contract is given by: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) where p(X) is a joint probability distribution over all possible contract outcomes: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) and U(X) is the utility derived from these possible outcomes: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) As before, whilst U(X) is known to the agent, the probability distribution p(X) is not. Rather, given the agents direct experience of the supplier, the agent can determine a distribution over possible values for p(X). In the single dimensional case, a beta distribution was the natural choice over possible values of p(o = 1). In the multi-dimensional case, where p(X) itself is a vector of probabilities, the corresponding natural choice is the Dirichlet distribution, since this is a conjugate prior for multinomial proportions [3]. Given this distribution, the agent is then able to calculate an estimate of the expected utility of a contract. As before, this estimate is itself represented by an expected value given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) and a variance, describing the uncertainty in this expected utility: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) where: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Thus, whilst the single dimensional case naturally leads to a trust model in which the agents attempt to derive an estimate of probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1), along with a scalar variance that describes the uncertainty in this probability, Var(p(o = 1)), in this case, the agents must derive an estimate of a vector of probabilities, ˆp(X), along with a covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), that represents the uncertainty in p(X) given the observed contractual outcomes. At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract. However, in the multi-dimensional case the agent must determine ˆp(X), and since this describes the probability of all possible contract outcomes, including those that are completely un-fulfilled, this direct semantic interpretation is not present. In the next section, we describe the exemplar utility function that we shall use in the remainder of this paper. 4.1 Exemplar Utility Function The approach described so far is completely general, in that it applies to any utility function of the form described above, and also applies to the estimation of any joint probability distribution. In the remainder of this paper, for illustrative purposes, we shall limit the discussion to the simplest possible utility function that exhibits a dependence upon the correlations between the contract dimensions. That is, we consider the case that expected utility is dependent only on the marginal probabilities of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, rather than the full joint probabilities: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Thus, ˆp(X) is a vector estimate of the probability of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, and maintains the clear semantic interpretation seen in the single dimensional case: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) The correlations between the contract dimensions affect the uncertainty in the expected utility. To see this, consider the covariance 1072 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) matrix that describes this uncertainty, Cov(p(X)), is now given by: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . . Cab Vb Cbc . . . Cac Cbc Vc . . . ... ... ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (12) In this matrix, the diagonal terms, Va, Vb and Vc, represent the uncertainties in p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) and p(oc = 1) within p(X). The off-diagonal terms, Cab, Cac and Cbc, represent the correlations between these probabilities. In the next section, we use the Dirichlet distribution to calculate both ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) from an agents direct experience of previous contract outcomes. We first illustrate why this is necessary by considering an alternative approach to modelling multi-dimensional contracts whereby an agent na¨ıvely assumes that the dimensions are independent, and thus, it models each individually by separate beta distributions (as in the single dimensional case we presented in section 3). This is actually equivalent to setting the off-diagonal terms within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), to zero. However, doing so can lead an agent to assume that its estimate of the expected utility of the contract is more accurate than it actually is. To illustrate this, consider a specific scenario with the following values: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 and Va = Vb = 0.2. In this case, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), and thus, if the correlation Cab is ignored then the variance in the expected utility is 0.4. However, if the contract outcomes are completely correlated then Cab = 1 and Var(E[U]) is actually 0.8. Thus, in order to have an accurate estimate of the variance of the expected contract utility, and to make a rational decision, it is essential that the agent is able to represent and calculate these correlation terms. In the next section, we describe how an agent may do so using the Dirichlet distribution. 4.2 The Dirichlet Distribution In this section, we describe how the agent may use its direct experience of previous contracts, and the standard results of the Dirichlet distribution, to determine an estimate of the probability that each contract dimension will be successful fulfilled, ˆp(X), and a measure of the uncertainties in these probabilities that expresses the correlations between the contract dimensions, Cov(p(X)). We first consider the calculation of ˆp(X) and the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)). As described above, the derivation of these results is identical to the case of the single dimensional beta distribution, where out of N contract outcomes, n are successfully fulfilled. In the multi-dimensional case, however, we have a vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} that represents the number of outcomes for which each of the individual contract dimensions were successfully fulfilled. Thus, in terms of the standard Dirichlet parameters where αa = na + 1 and α0 = N + 2, the agent can estimate the probability of this contract dimension being successfully fulfilled: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 and can also calculate the variance in any contract dimension: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) However, calculating the off-diagonal terms within Cov(p(X)) is more complex since it is necessary to consider the correlations between the contract dimensions. Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j. For example, nab 10 represents the number of contracts for which oa = 1 and ob = 0. Now, using the standard Dirichlet notation, we can define αab ij nab ij + 1 for all i and j taking values 0 and 1, and then, to calculate the cross-correlations between contract pairs a and b, we note that the Dirichlet distribution over pair-wise joint probabilities is: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 where: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 and Kab is a normalising constant [3]. From this we can derive pair-wise probability estimates and variances: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) where: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) and in fact, α0 = N + 2, where N is the total number of contracts observed. Likewise, we can express the covariance in these pairwise probabilities in similar terms: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0) Finally, we can use the expression: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) to determine the covariance Cab. To do so, we first simplify the notation by defining V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] and Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)]. The covariance for the probability of positive contract outcomes is then the covariance between j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) and i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), and thus: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11 . Thus, given a set of contract outcomes that represent the agents previous interactions with a supplier, we may use the Dirichlet distribution to calculate the mean and variance of the probability of any contract dimension being successfully fulfilled (i.e. ˆp(oa = 1) and Va). In addition, by a somewhat more complex procedure we can also calculate the correlations between these probabilities (i.e. Cab). This allows us to calculate an estimate of the probability that any contract dimension will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(X), and also represent the uncertainty and correlations in these probabilities by the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)). In turn, these results may be used to calculate the estimate and uncertainty in the expected utility of the contract. In the next section we present empirical results that show that in practise this formalism yields significant improvements in these estimates compared to the na¨ıve approximation using multiple independent beta distributions. 4.3 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our formalism, and show the importance of the off-diagonal terms in Cov(p(X)), we compare two approaches: The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1073 −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Correlation (ρ) Var(E[U]) Dirichlet Distribution Indepedent Beta Distributions −1 −0.5 0 0.5 1 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 x 10 4 Correlation (ρ) Information(I) Dirichlet Distribution Indepedent Beta Distributions Figure 1: Plots showing (i) the variance of the expected contract utility and (ii) the information content of the estimates computed using the Dirichlet distribution and multiple independent beta distributions. Results are averaged over 106 runs, and the error bars show the standard error in the mean. • Dirichlet Distribution: We use the full Dirichlet distribution, as described above, to calculate ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) including all its off-diagonal terms that represent the correlations between the contract dimensions. • Independent Beta Distributions: We use independent beta distributions to represent each contract dimension, in order to calculate ˆp(X), and then, as described earlier, we approximate Cov(p(X)) and ignore the correlations by setting all the off-diagonal terms to zero. We consider a two-dimensional case where u(oa = 1) = 6 and u(ob = 1) = 2, since this allows us to plot ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) as ellipses in a two-dimensional plane, and thus explain the differences between the two approaches. Specifically, we initially allocate the agent some previous contract outcomes that represents its direct experience with a supplier. The number of contracts is drawn uniformly between 10 and 20, and the actual contract outcomes are drawn from an arbitrary joint distribution intended to induce correlations between the contract dimensions. For each set of contracts, we use the approaches described above to calculate ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)), and hence, the variance in the expected contract utility, Var(E[U]). In addition, we calculate a scalar measure of the information content, I, of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)), which is a standard way of measuring the uncertainty encoded within the covariance matrix [1]. More specifically, we calculate the determinant of the inverse of the covariance matrix: I = det(Cov(p(X))−1 ) (16) and note that the larger the information content, the more precise ˆp(X) will be, and thus, the better the estimate of the expected utility that the agent is able to calculate. Finally, we use the results 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 p(o =1) p(o=1) a b Dirichlet Distribution Indepedent Beta Distributions Figure 2: Examples of ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) plotted as second standard error ellipses. presented in section 4.2 to calculate the actual correlation, ρ, associated with this particular set of contract outcomes: ρ = Cab √ VaVb (17) where Cab, Va and Vb are calculated as described in section 4.2. The results of this analysis are shown in figure 1. Here we show the values of I and Var(E[U]) calculated by the agents, plotted against the correlation of the contract outcomes, ρ, that constituted their direct experience. The results are averaged over 106 simulation runs. Note that as expected, when the dimensions of the contract outcomes are uncorrelated (i.e. ρ = 0), then both approaches give the same results. However, the value of using our formalism with the full Dirichlet distribution is shown when the correlation between the dimensions increases (either negatively or positively). As can be seen, if we approximate the Dirichlet distribution with multiple independent beta distributions, all of the correlation information contained within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), is lost, and thus, the information content of the matrix is much lower. The loss of this correlation information leads the variance of the expected utility of the contract to be incorrect (either over or under estimated depending on the correlation)5 , with the exact amount of mis-estimation depending on the actual utility function chosen (i.e. the values of u(oa = 1) and u(ob = 1)). In addition, in figure 2 we illustrate an example of the estimates calculated through both methods, for a single exemplar set of contract outcomes. We represent the probability estimates, ˆp(X), and the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), in the standard way as an ellipse [1]. That is, ˆp(X) determines the position of the center of the ellipse, Cov(p(X)) defines its size and shape. Note that whilst the ellipse resulting from the full Dirichlet formalism accurately reflects the true distribution (samples of which are plotted as points), that calculated by using multiple independent Beta distributions (and thus ignoring the correlations) results in a much larger ellipse that does not reflect the true distribution. The larger size of this ellipse is a result of the off-diagonal terms of the covariance matrix being set to zero, and corresponds to the agent miscalculating the uncertainty in the probability of each contract dimension being fulfilled. This, in turn, leads it to miscalculate the uncertainty in the expected utility of a contract (shown in figure 1 as Var(E[U]). 5. COMMUNICATING REPUTATION Having described how an individual agent can use its own direct experience of contract outcomes in order to estimate the probabil5 Note that the plots are not smooth due to the fact that given a limited number of contract outcomes, then the mean of Va and Vb do not vary smoothly with ρ. 1074 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) ity that a multi-dimensional contract will be successfully fulfilled, we now go on to consider how agents within an open multi-agent system can communicate these estimates to one another. This is commonly referred to as reputation and allows agents with limited direct experience of a supplier to make rational decisions. Both Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al. present models whereby reputation is communicated between agents using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution [6, 11]. This approach is attractive since these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of contracts observed, N, and the number of these that were successfully fulfilled, n). Under the probabilistic framework of the beta distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agents own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes. We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution. In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions). For instance, in the case of three dimensions, N, is given by: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information. Again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier. Finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here, by adopting the same principled approach as Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within this multi-dimensional model. However, we now go on to consider a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks. 6. RUMOUR PROPAGATION WITHIN REPUTATION SYSTEMS In the previous section, we described the use of sufficient statistics to communicate reputation, and we showed that by aggregating contract outcomes together into these sufficient statistics, a large number of contract outcomes can be represented and communicated in a compact form. Whilst, this is an attractive property, it can be problematic in practise, since the individual provenance of each contract outcome is lost in the aggregation. Thus, to ensure an accurate estimate, the reputation system must ensure that each observation of a contract outcome is included within the aggregated statistics no more than once. Within a centralised reputation system, where all agents report their direct experience to a trusted center, such double counting of contract outcomes is easy to avoid. However, in a decentralised reputation system, where agents communicate reputation to one another, and aggregate their direct experience with these reputation reports on-the-fly, avoiding double counting is much more difficult. a1 a2 a3 ¨ ¨¨ ¨¨ ¨¨B E T N1 N1 N1 + N2 Figure 3: Example of rumour propagation in a decentralised reputation system. For example, consider the case shown in figure 3 where three agents (a1 . . . a3), each with some direct experience of a supplier, share reputation reports regarding this supplier. If agent a1 were to provide its estimate to agents a2 and a3 in the form of the sufficient statistics of its Dirichlet distribution, then these agents can aggregate these contract outcomes with their own, and thus obtain more precise estimates. If at a later stage, agent a2 were to send its aggregate vector of contract outcomes to agent a3, then agent a3 being unaware of the full history of exchanges, may attempt to combine these contract outcomes with its own aggregated vector. However, since both vectors contain a contribution from agent a1, these will be counted twice in the final aggregated vector, and will result in a biased and overconfident estimate. This is termed rumour propagation or data incest in the data fusion literature [9]. One possible solution would be to uniquely identify the source of each contract outcome, and then propagate each vector, along with its label, through the network. Agents can thus identify identical observations that have arrived through different routes, and after removing the duplicates, can aggregate these together to form their estimates. Whilst this appears to be attractive in principle, for a number of reasons, it is not always a viable solution in practise [12]. Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage. As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with). Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system). Finally, it may actually be difficult to assign globally agreeable, consistent, and unique labels for each agent within an open system. In the next section, we develop a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems. Our solution is based on an approach developed within the area of target tracking and data fusion [9]. It avoids the need to uniquely identify an agent, it allows agents to restrict the number of other agents who they reveal their private estimates to, and yet it still allows information to propagate throughout the network. 6.1 Private and Shared Information Our solution to rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems introduces the notion of private information that an agent knows it has not communicated to any other agent, and shared information that has been communicated to, or received from, another agent. Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately. Both the origThe Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1075 inating and receiving agents then update their two vectors appropriately. To understand this, consider the case that agent aα sends its private and shared contract outcome vectors, Nα p and Nα s , to agent aβ that itself has private and shared contract outcomes Nβ p and Nβ s . Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private. Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes). It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s . Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate. Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate. If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector. This procedure has a number of attractive properties. Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided. However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network. Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases. Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours. If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information. Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents. Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents. Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3). At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions. We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section. That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes. At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience. In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience. In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates. We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent. This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network. However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns. Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution. The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4. Here we show the sum of the information content of each agents covariance matrix (calculated as discussed earlier in section 4.3), for each of these four different approaches. We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration. Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved. This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases. Next, we note that in the case of rumour propagation, the information content increases continually, and rapidly exceeds the centralised reputation result. The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events. Finally, we note that using private and shared information represents a compromise between the private information only case and the centralised reputation case. Information is still allowed to propagate around the network, however rumours are eliminated. As before, we also plot a single instance of the trust estimates from one agent (i.e. ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X))) as a set of ellipses on a 1076 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1 2 3 4 5 10 4 10 6 10 8 10 10 Iteration Information(I) Private & Shared Information Rumour Propagation Private Information Only Centralised Reputation Figure 4: Sum of information over all agents as a function of the communication iteration. two-dimensional plane (along with samples from the true distribution). As expected, the centralised reputation system achieves the best estimate of the true distribution, since it uses the direct experience of all agents. The private information only case shows the largest ellipse since it propagates the least information around the network. The rumour propagation case shows the smallest ellipse, but it is inconsistent with the actual distribution p(X). Thus, propagating rumours around the network and double counting contract outcomes in the belief that they are independent events, results in an overconfident estimate. However, we note that our solution, using separate vectors of private and shared information, allows us to propagate more information than the private information only case, but we completely avoid the problems of rumour propagation. Finally, we consider the effect that this has on the agents calculation of the expected utility of the contract. We assume the same utility function as used in section 4.3 (i.e. u(oa = 1) = 6 and u(ob = 1) = 2), and in table 1 we present the estimate of the expected utility, and its standard deviation calculated for all four cases by a single agent at iteration five (after communication has ceased to have any further effect for all methods other than rumour propagation). We note that the rumour propagation case is clearly inconsistent with the centralised reputation system, since its standard deviation is too small and does not reflect the true uncertainty in the expected utility, given the contract outcomes. However, we observe that our solution represents the closest case to the centralised reputation system, and thus succeeds in propagating information throughout the network, whilst also avoiding bias and overconfidence. The exact difference between it and the centralised reputation system depends upon the topology of the network, and the history of exchanges that take place within it. 7. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we addressed the need for a principled probabilistic model of computational trust that deals with contracts that have multiple correlated dimensions. Our starting point was an agent estimating the expected utility of a contract, and we showed that this leads to a model of computational trust that uses the Dirichlet distribution to calculate a trust estimate from the direct experience of an agent. We then showed how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to represent and communicate reputation within a decentralised reputation system, and we presented a solution to rumour propagation within these systems. Our future work in this area is to extend the exchange of reputation to the case where contracts are not homogeneous. That is, not all agents observe the same contract dimensions. This is a challenging extension, since in this case, the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution can not be used directly.

Categorías y descriptores de sujetos I.2.11 [Inteligencia artificial distribuida]: Agentes inteligentes Algoritmos de términos generales, diseño, teoría 1. Introducción El papel de los modelos computacionales de confianza dentro de los sistemas de múltiples agentes en particular, y los sistemas distribuidos abiertos en general, ha generado recientemente una gran cantidad de interés de investigación. En tales sistemas, los agentes generalmente deben elegir entre socios de interacción, y en este contexto se puede ver que la confianza proporciona un medio para que los agentes representen y estimen la confiabilidad con la que estos socios de interacción cumplirán sus compromisos. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, gran parte del trabajo dentro de esta área ha utilizado métricas de confianza específicas de dominio o ad-hoc, y se ha centrado en proporcionar heurísticas para evaluar y actualizar estas métricas utilizando informes de experiencia y reputación directa de otros agentes (ver [8] parauna revisión). El trabajo reciente ha intentado colocar la noción de confianza computacional dentro del marco de la teoría de la probabilidad [6, 11]. Este enfoque permite que muchos de los desiderata de modelos de confianza computacional se aborden a través de medios de principios. En particular: (i) permite a los agentes actualizar sus estimaciones de la confiabilidad de un proveedor a medida que adquieren experiencia directa, (ii) proporciona un marco natural para que los agentes expresen su incertidumbre esta confiabilidad, y (iii) permite a los agentesPara intercambiar, combinar y filtrar informes de reputación recibidos de otros agentes. Si bien este enfoque es atractivo, es algo limitado, ya que hasta ahora solo ha considerado resultados de una sola dimensión (es decir, si el contrato ha tenido éxito o ha fallado en su totalidad). Sin embargo, en muchos entornos del mundo real, el éxito o el fracaso de una interacción pueden descomponerse en varias dimensiones [7]. Esto presenta el desafío de combinar estas múltiples dimensiones en una sola métrica sobre la cual se puede tomar una decisión. Además, estas dimensiones típicamente también exhibirán correlaciones. Por ejemplo, un contrato dentro de una cadena de suministro puede especificar criterios de puntualidad, calidad y cantidad. Un proveedor que sufre retrasos puede intentar una compensación entre estas dimensiones suministrando el monto total tarde o suministrando la mayor cantidad posible (pero menor que la cantidad especificada dentro del contrato) a tiempo. Por lo tanto, las correlaciones surgirán naturalmente entre estas dimensiones y, por lo tanto, entre las probabilidades que describen el cumplimiento exitoso de cada dimensión del contrato. Hasta la fecha, sin embargo, no existe tal marco de principios para describir estos contratos multidimensionales, ni las correlaciones entre estas dimensiones (aunque existen algunos modelos ad-hoc; consulte la Sección 2 para obtener más detalles). Para rectificar esta deficiencia, en este documento desarrollamos un modelo probabilístico de confianza computacional que trata explícitamente con contratos multidimensionales correlacionados. El punto de partida para nuestro trabajo es considerar cómo un agente puede estimar la utilidad que derivará de interactuar con un proveedor. Aquí utilizamos enfoques estándar de la literatura de fusión de datos (ya que este es un campo bien desarrollado donde la noción de estimaciones correlacionadas multidimensionales está bien establecida1) para mostrar que esto naturalmente conduce a un modelo de confianza donde el agente debe estimar las probabilidades y las correlacionesMás de 1 en este contexto, las dimensiones múltiples generalmente representan las coordenadas físicas de un objetivo que se está rastreando, y surgen correlaciones a través de la operación y orientación de los sensores.1070 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) C 2007 Ifaamas múltiples dimensiones. Sobre la base de esto, ideamos un nuevo modelo de confianza que aborde los tres desiderata discutidos anteriormente. Con más detalle, en este artículo extendemos el estado del arte de cuatro maneras clave: 1. Diseñamos un nuevo modelo de confianza probabilística multidimensional que permite a un agente estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato, estimando (i) la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito, y (ii) las correlaciones entre estas estimaciones.2. Presentamos un modelo probabilístico exacto basado en la distribución de Dirichlet que permite a los agentes utilizar su experiencia directa de los resultados del contrato para calcular las probabilidades y correlaciones descritas anteriormente. Luego comparamos esta solución y mostramos que conduce a buenas estimaciones.3. Mostramos que los agentes pueden usar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para intercambiar informes de reputación entre sí. Las estadísticas suficientes representan agregaciones de su experiencia directa y, por lo tanto, expresan los resultados del contrato en un formato compacto sin pérdida de información.4. Mostramos que, si bien es eficiente, la agregación de los resultados del contrato puede conducir a un doble recuento y una propagación de rumores, en los sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Por lo tanto, presentamos una solución novedosa basada en la idea de información privada y compartida. Mostramos que produce estimaciones consistentes con un sistema de reputación centralizado, al tiempo que mantiene el anonimato de los agentes y evita el exceso de confianza. El resto de este documento se organiza de la siguiente manera: en la Sección 2 revisamos el trabajo relacionado. En la Sección 3 presentamos nuestra notación para un contrato dimensional único, antes de introducir nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional en la Sección 4. En las Secciones 5 y 6 discutimos la reputación de comunicación y presentamos nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores en los sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Concluimos en la Sección 7. 2. Trabajo relacionado La necesidad de un modelo de confianza multidimensional ha sido reconocido por varios investigadores. Sabater y Sierra presentan un modelo de reputación, en el que los agentes forman contratos basados en múltiples variables (como la fecha de entrega y la calidad), y definen las impresiones como evaluaciones subjetivas del resultado de estos contratos. Proporcionan enfoques heurísticos para combinar estas impresiones para formar una medida que llaman reputación subjetiva. Del mismo modo, Griffiths descompone la confianza general en varias dimensiones diferentes, como el éxito, el costo, la puntualidad y la calidad [4]. En su caso, cada dimensión se califica como un número real que representa un valor comparativo sin un significado semántico fuerte. Desarrolla una regla heurística para actualizar estos valores basados en las experiencias directas del agente individual, y una función heurística que toma las dimensiones de confianza individuales y genera un solo escalar que luego se usa para seleccionar entre proveedores. Mientras que comenta que los valores de confianza podrían tener algún nivel de confianza asociado, no se presentan heurísticas para actualizar estos niveles. Gujral et al.Tome un enfoque similar y presente un modelo de confianza sobre dimensiones específicas de dominio múltiple [5]. Definen los requisitos de objetivos multidimensionales y evalúan una recompensa esperada basada en un comportamiento estimado de los proveedores. Sin embargo, estas estimaciones son agregaciones simples sobre la experiencia directa de varios agentes, y no hay medida de la incertidumbre. Sin embargo, muestran que los agentes que seleccionan proveedores basados en estas múltiples dimensiones superan a aquellos que consideran solo uno. Por el contrario, varios investigadores han presentado modelos de confianza computacionales más principales basados en la teoría de la probabilidad, aunque limitado a una sola dimensión. Jøsang e Ismail describen el sistema de reputación beta por el cual la reputación de un agente se compila de los informes positivos y negativos de otros agentes que han interactuado con él [6]. La distribución beta representa una elección natural para representar estos resultados binarios, y proporciona un medio de principios para representar la incertidumbre. Además, proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial que incluye un enfoque para intercambiar informes de reputación utilizando las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta, métodos para descartar las opiniones de los agentes que tienen bajas calificaciones de reputación y técnicas para tratar la reputación de la reputacióncambian con el tiempo. Del mismo modo, Teacy et al.Use la distribución beta para describir a los agentes que creen en la probabilidad de que otro agente cumpla con éxito sus compromisos [11]. Presentan un formalismo utilizando una distribución beta que permite al agente estimar esta probabilidad en función de su experiencia directa, y nuevamente usan las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución para comunicar esta estimación a otros agentes. Proporcionan una serie de extensiones a este modelo inicial y, en particular, consideran que los agentes no siempre informan sinceramente sus estimaciones de confianza. Por lo tanto, presentan un enfoque de principios para detectar y eliminar informes inconsistentes. Nuestro trabajo se basa en estos enfoques más principales. Sin embargo, el punto de partida de nuestro enfoque es considerar un agente que intenta estimar la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Mostramos que estimar esta utilidad esperada requiere que un agente estime la probabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá su contrato. En el caso de una sola dimensión, esto naturalmente conduce a un modelo de confianza utilizando la distribución beta (según Jøsang e Ismail y Teacy et al.). Sin embargo, luego extendemos este análisis a múltiples dimensiones, donde utilizamos la extensión natural de la distribución beta, a saber, la distribución de Dirichlet, para representar la creencia de los agentes en múltiples dimensiones.3. Fideicomiso de una sola dimensión Antes de presentar nuestro modelo de confianza multidimensional, primero presentamos la notación y el formalismo que utilizaremos describiendo el caso dimensional único más familiar. Consideramos un agente que debe decidir si participar en un contrato futuro con un proveedor. Este contrato conducirá a algún resultado, o, y consideramos que o = 1 si el contrato se cumple con éxito, y o = 0 si no2. Para que el agente tome una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que derivará de este contrato. Suponemos que en el caso de que el contrato se cumpla con éxito, el agente deriva una utilidad u (o = 1), de lo contrario no recibe utilidad3. Ahora, dado que el agente no está seguro de la confiabilidad con la que el proveedor cumplirá el contrato, debe considerar la utilidad esperada que derivará, e [u], y esto viene dado por: e [u] = p (o= 1) u (o = 1) (1) donde p (o = 1) es la probabilidad de que el proveedor cumpla con éxito el contrato. Sin embargo, mientras que U (o = 1) es conocido por el agente, P (O = 1) no lo es. Lo mejor que el agente puede hacer es determinar una distribución sobre posibles valores de P (O = 1) dada su experiencia directa de resultados anteriores del contrato. Dado que ha podido hacerlo, puede determinar una estimación de la utilidad esperada4 del contrato, e [e [u]], y una medida de su incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada, var (e]). Esta incertidumbre es importante, ya que un agente atosco de riesgos puede tomar una decisión con respecto a un contrato, 2 Tenga en cuenta que solo consideramos los resultados del contrato binario, aunque extender esto a los resultados parciales es parte de nuestro trabajo futuro.3 Claramente, esto se puede extender al caso en el que se deriva alguna utilidad de un resultado fallido.4 Tenga en cuenta que esto a menudo se llama la utilidad esperada esperada, y esta es la notación que adoptamos aquí [2]. El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 1071 no solo en su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato, sino también sobre la probabilidad de que la utilidad esperada exceda una cantidad mínima. Estas dos propiedades están dadas por: e [e [u]] = ˆp (o = 1) u (o = 1) (2) var (e [u]) = var (p (o = 1)) u (o= 1) 2 (3) donde ˆp (o = 1) y var (p (o = 1)) son la estimación y la incertidumbre de la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, y se calculan a partir de la distribución sobre posibles valores deP (O = 1) que el agente determina a partir de su experiencia directa. El enfoque basado en servicios públicos que presentamos aquí proporciona una motivación atractiva para este modelo de Teacy et al.[11]. Ahora, en el caso de los resultados del contrato binario, la distribución beta es la elección natural para representar la distribución sobre posibles valores de P (O = 1) ya que dentro de las estadísticas bayesianas esto bien conocido es el conjugado anterior a las observaciones binomiales [3]. Al adoptar la distribución beta, podemos calcular ˆp (o = 1) y var (p (o = 1)) utilizando resultados estándar, y por lo tanto, si un agente observó n contratos anteriores de los cuales n se cumplieron con éxito, entonces: ˆp ((o = 1) = n + 1 n + 2 y: var (p (o = 1)) = (n + 1) (n - n + 1) (n + 2) 2 (n + 3) Tenga en cuenta que como se esperaba como se esperaba, cuanto mayor sea el número de contratos que observa el agente, menor será el término de varianza var (p (o = 1)) y, por lo tanto, menos la incertidumbre con respecto a la probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp (o = 1).4. Fideicomiso multidimensional ahora ampliamos la descripción anterior, para considerar los contratos entre proveedores y agentes que están representados por múltiples dimensiones y, por lo tanto, el éxito o el fracaso de un contrato puede descomponerse en el éxito o el fracaso de cada dimensión separada. Considere nuevamente el ejemplo de la cadena de suministro que especifica la puntualidad, la cantidad y la calidad de los bienes que se entregarán. Por lo tanto, dentro de nuestro modelo de confianza OA = 1 ahora indica un resultado exitoso sobre la dimensión A del contrato y OA = 0 indica uno sin éxito. Un resultado del contrato, X, ahora está compuesto por un vector de resultados de la parte del contrato individual (p. X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0 ,...}). Dado un contrato multidimensional cuyo resultado es descrito por el Vector X, nuevamente consideramos que para que un agente tome una decisión racional, debe considerar la utilidad que obtendrá de este contrato. Para este fin, podemos hacer la declaración general de que la utilidad esperada de un contrato está dada por: E [u] = p (x) u (x) t (4) donde p (x) es una distribución de probabilidad conjunta en todoPosibles resultados del contrato: P (x) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ P (OA = 1, OB = 0, OC = 0, ...) P (OA = 1, OB = 1, OC = 0, ...)P (OA = 0, Ob = 1, OC = 0, ...) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) y u (x) es la utilidad derivada de estos posibles resultados: u (x) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜⎜ ⎜ ⎝ U (OA = 1, Ob = 0, OC = 0, ...) U (OA = 1, OB = 1, OC = 0, ...) U (OA = 0, OB = 1, OC= 0, ...) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) Como antes, mientras que U (x) es conocido por el agente, la distribución de probabilidad P (x) no lo es. Más bien, dada la experiencia directa de los agentes del proveedor, el agente puede determinar una distribución sobre posibles valores para P (x). En el caso dimensional único, una distribución beta fue la elección natural sobre los posibles valores de P (O = 1). En el caso multidimensional, donde P (x) en sí es un vector de probabilidades, la elección natural correspondiente es la distribución de Dirichlet, ya que este es un conjugado anterior para proporciones multinomiales [3]. Dada esta distribución, el agente puede calcular una estimación de la utilidad esperada de un contrato. Como antes, esta estimación está representada por un valor esperado dado por: e [e [u]] = ˆp (x) u (x) t (7) y una varianza, describiendo la incertidumbre en esta utilidad esperada: var (e[U]) = u (x) cov (p (x)) u (x) t (8) donde: cov (p (x)) e [(p (x) - ˆp (x)) (p (x) - ˆp (x)) t] (9) Por lo tanto, mientras que el caso de dimensión única conduce naturalmente a un modelo de confianza en el que los agentes intentan obtener una estimación de probabilidad de que un contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp (o = 1), junto con una varianza escalar que describe la incertidumbre en esta probabilidad, var (p (o = 1)), en este caso, los agentes deben derivar una estimación de un vector de probabilidades, ˆp (x), junto con una matriz de covarianza, CoV (p (x)), que representa la incertidumbre en P (x) dados los resultados contractuales observados. En este punto, es interesante observar que la estimación en el caso dimensional único, ˆp (o = 1), tiene un claro significado semántico en relación con la confianza;Es la creencia de los agentes en la probabilidad de que un proveedor cumpla con éxito un contrato. Sin embargo, en el caso multidimensional, el agente debe determinar ˆp (x), y dado que esto describe la probabilidad de todos los resultados del contrato posibles, incluidos aquellos que están completamente no cumplidos, esta interpretación semántica directa no está presente. En la siguiente sección, describimos la función de utilidad ejemplar que usaremos en el resto de este documento.4.1 Función de utilidad ejemplar El enfoque descrito hasta ahora es completamente general, ya que se aplica a cualquier función de utilidad de la forma descrita anteriormente, y también se aplica a la estimación de cualquier distribución de probabilidad conjunta. En el resto de este documento, con fines ilustrativos, limitaremos la discusión a la función de utilidad más simple posible que exhibe una dependencia de las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Es decir, consideramos el caso de que la utilidad esperada depende solo de las probabilidades marginales de que cada dimensión del contrato se realice con éxito, en lugar de las probabilidades conjuntas completas: u (x) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ⎝ U (OA = 1) U (ob = 1) u (oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Por lo tanto, ˆp (x) es una estimación vectorial de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito, y mantiene la clara interpretación semántica vista enEl caso dimensional único: ˆp (x) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp (OA = 1) ˆP (OB = 1) ˆP (OC = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) Las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contratoafectar la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada. Para ver esto, considere la covarianza 1072 el sexto intl. Conf.En los agentes autónomos y la matriz de sistemas múltiples (AAMAS 07) que describe esta incertidumbre, CoV (P (x)), ahora es dada por: CoV (P (x)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ⎝ VA CAC CAC... Cab VB CBC... CAC CBC VC...... ... ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎠ (12) En esta matriz, los términos diagonales, VA, VB y VC, representan las incertidumbres en P (OA = 1), P (OB = 1) y P(OC = 1) dentro de P (x). Los términos fuera de la diagonal, CAB, CAC y CBC, representan las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades. En la siguiente sección, utilizamos la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular ˆp (x) y cov (p (x)) de una experiencia directa de los agentes de resultados anteriores del contrato. Primero ilustramos por qué esto es necesario considerando un enfoque alternativo para modelar contratos multidimensionales por los cuales un agente supone que las dimensiones son independientes y, por lo tanto, modela cada uno individualmente mediante distribuciones beta separadas (como en el caso dimensional único nosotrospresentado en la sección 3). Esto es realmente equivalente a establecer los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de la matriz de covarianza, CoV (P (x)), a cero. Sin embargo, hacerlo puede llevar a un agente a suponer que su estimación de la utilidad esperada del contrato es más precisa de lo que realmente es. Para ilustrar esto, considere un escenario específico con los siguientes valores: U (OA = 1) = U (OB = 1) = 1 y VA = VB = 0.2. En este caso, Var (E [U]) = 0.4 (1 + CAB), y por lo tanto, si la CAB de correlación se ignora, la varianza en la utilidad esperada es 0.4. Sin embargo, si los resultados del contrato están completamente correlacionados, entonces CAB = 1 y Var (E [u]) es en realidad 0.8. Por lo tanto, para tener una estimación precisa de la varianza de la utilidad del contrato esperada, y para tomar una decisión racional, es esencial que el agente pueda representar y calcular estos términos de correlación. En la siguiente sección, describimos cómo un agente puede hacerlo utilizando la distribución de Dirichlet.4.2 La distribución de Dirichlet En esta sección, describimos cómo el agente puede usar su experiencia directa de contratos anteriores, y los resultados estándar de la distribución de Dirichlet, para determinar una estimación de la probabilidad de que cada dimensión de contrato se cumpla exitosa, ˆp (x), y una medida de las incertidumbres en estas probabilidades que expresan las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato, CoV (p (x)). Primero consideramos el cálculo de ˆp (x) y los términos diagonales de la matriz de covarianza CoV (P (x)). Como se describió anteriormente, la derivación de estos resultados es idéntica al caso de la distribución beta dimensional única, donde de los resultados del contrato, N se cumplen con éxito. En el caso multidimensional, sin embargo, tenemos un vector {na, nb, nc ,...} que representa el número de resultados para los cuales cada una de las dimensiones del contrato individual se cumplió con éxito. Por lo tanto, en términos de los parámetros estándar de Dirichlet donde αA = Na + 1 y α0 = n + 2, el agente puede estimar la probabilidad de que esta dimensión de contrato se realice con éxito: ˆP (OA = 1) = αA α0 = Na + 1 N+ 2 y también puede calcular la varianza en cualquier dimensión de contrato: VA = αA (α0 - αA) α2 0 (1 + α0) = (Na + 1) (N - Na + 1) (N + 2) 2 (N +3) Sin embargo, calcular los términos fuera de la diagonal dentro de CoV (P (x)) es más complejo, ya que es necesario considerar las correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Por lo tanto, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, A y B), debemos considerar todas las combinaciones posibles de los resultados del contrato, y por lo tanto definimos NAB IJ como el número de resultados del contrato para los cuales OA = I y OB = J. Por ejemplo, NAB 10 representa el número de contratos para los cuales OA = 1 y OB = 0. Ahora, utilizando la notación estándar de Dirichlet, podemos definir αab ij nab ij + 1 para todos los valores de TODO I y J tomando 0 y 1, y luego, para calcular las correlaciones cruzadas entre los pares de contrato A y B, notamos que la distribución de DirichletLas probabilidades conjuntas sobre pares en términos de pares son: prob (pab) = kab i∈ {0,1} j∈ {0,1} P (OA = i, ob = j) αab ij −1 donde: i∈ {0,1} j∈ {0,1} P (OA = I, Ob = J) = 1 y KAB es una constante normalización [3]. De esto podemos derivar estimaciones y variaciones de probabilidad en parejas: E [P (OA = I, OB = J)] = αAb IJ α0 (13) V [P (OA = I, OB = J)] = αAb IJ (α0 - αab ij) α2 0 (1 + α0) (14) donde: α0 = i∈ {0,1} j∈ {0,1} αab ij (15) y, de hecho, α0 = n + 2, donde nes el número total de contratos observados. Del mismo modo, podemos expresar la covarianza en estas probabilidades por pares en términos similares: C [P (OA = I, OB = J), P (OA = M, OB = N)] = −αab IJ αAB Mn α2 0 (1 +α0) Finalmente, podemos usar la expresión: P (OA = 1) = j∈ {0,1} P (OA = 1, Ob = J) para determinar la cabina de covarianza. Para hacerlo, primero simplificamos la notación definiendo v ab ij v [p (oa = i, ob = j)] y CAB ijmn c [p (oa = i, ob = j), p (oa = m, ob, ob (OB= n)]. La covarianza para la probabilidad de los resultados positivos del contrato es la covarianza entre j∈ {0,1} P (OA = 1, Ob = J) y i∈ {0,1} P (OA = I, Ob = 1),Y así: CAB = CAB 1001 + CAB 1101 + CAB 1011 + V AB 11. Por lo tanto, dado un conjunto de resultados del contrato que representan las interacciones anteriores de los agentes con un proveedor, podemos usar la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular la media y la varianza de la probabilidad de que cualquier dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito (es decir, ˆP (OA = 1) y VA). Además, mediante un procedimiento algo más complejo también podemos calcular las correlaciones entre estas probabilidades (es decir, Taxi). Esto nos permite calcular una estimación de la probabilidad de que cualquier dimensión del contrato se cumpla con éxito, ˆp (x), y también representa la incertidumbre y las correlaciones en estas probabilidades por la matriz de covarianza, CoV (P (x)). A su vez, estos resultados pueden usarse para calcular la estimación y la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada del contrato. En la siguiente sección presentamos resultados empíricos que muestran que en la práctica este formalismo produce mejoras significativas en estas estimaciones en comparación con la aproximación na¨ıve utilizando múltiples distribuciones beta independientes.4.3 Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de nuestro formalismo y mostrar la importancia de los términos fuera de la diagonal en CoV (P (X)), comparamos dos enfoques: el sexto intl.

Consideramos un caso bidimensional donde u (oa = 1) = 6 y u (ob = 1) = 2, ya que esto nos permite trazar ˆp (x) y cov (p (x)) como elipses en un dos-plano dimensional y, por lo tanto, explicar las diferencias entre los dos enfoques. Específicamente, inicialmente asignamos al agente algunos resultados anteriores del contrato que representa su experiencia directa con un proveedor. El número de contratos se dibuja de manera uniforme entre 10 y 20, y los resultados del contrato reales se extraen de una distribución arbitraria conjunta destinada a inducir correlaciones entre las dimensiones del contrato. Para cada conjunto de contratos, utilizamos los enfoques descritos anteriormente para calcular ˆp (x) y cov (p (x)) y, por lo tanto, la varianza en la utilidad del contrato esperado, var (e [u]). Además, calculamos una medida escalar del contenido de información, i, de la matriz de covarianza CoV (P (x)), que es una forma estándar de medir la incertidumbre codificada dentro de la matriz de covarianza [1]. Más específicamente, calculamos el determinante del inverso de la matriz de covarianza: i = det (cov (p (x)) - 1) (16) y observamos que cuanto mayor sea el contenido de información, más preciso ˆp (x) será, y por lo tanto, cuanto mejor sea la estimación de la utilidad esperada que el agente puede calcular. Finalmente, usamos los resultados 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 P (O = 1) P (O = 1) A B Distribución de Dirichlet Distribuciones beta independientes Figura 2: Ejemplos de ˆp (x) y CoV (P (P (P (P (P (P (P (P (P (P (P (P (P (P (P (P (P (X)) trazado como segundo elipses de error estándar.Presentado en la Sección 4.2 para calcular la correlación real, ρ, asociada con este conjunto particular de resultados del contrato: ρ = CAB √ Vavb (17) donde CAB, VA y VB se calculan como se describe en la Sección 4.2. Los resultados de este análisis se muestran en la Figura 1. Aquí mostramos los valores de I y Var (e [u]) calculados por los agentes, trazados contra la correlación de los resultados del contrato, ρ, que constituyeron su experiencia directa. Los resultados se promedian en 106 ejecuciones de simulación. Tenga en cuenta que, como se esperaba, cuando las dimensiones de los resultados del contrato no están correlacionadas (es decir, ρ = 0), ambos enfoques dan los mismos resultados. Sin embargo, el valor de usar nuestro formalismo con la distribución completa de Dirichlet se muestra cuando aumenta la correlación entre las dimensiones (ya sea negativamente o positivamente). Como se puede ver, si aproximamos la distribución de Dirichlet con múltiples distribuciones beta independientes, toda la información de correlación contenida dentro de la matriz de covarianza, CoV (P (x)), se pierde y, por lo tanto, el contenido de información de la matriz es muchomás bajo. La pérdida de esta información de correlación lleva a la varianza de la utilidad esperada del contrato para que sea incorrecta (ya sea sobre o bajo estimada dependiendo de la correlación) 5, con la cantidad exacta de equivocación, dependiendo de la función de utilidad real elegida (es decir, elvalores de u (oa = 1) y u (ob = 1)). Además, en la Figura 2 ilustramos un ejemplo de las estimaciones calculadas a través de ambos métodos, para un solo conjunto ejemplar de resultados del contrato. Representamos las estimaciones de probabilidad, ˆp (x) y la matriz de covarianza, CoV (P (x)), de la manera estándar como elipse [1]. Es decir, ˆp (x) determina la posición del centro de la elipse, CoV (P (x)) define su tamaño y forma. Tenga en cuenta que si bien la elipse resultante del formalismo de Dirichlet completo refleja con precisión la distribución verdadera (muestras de las cuales se trazan como puntos), que se calcula mediante el uso de múltiples distribuciones beta independientes (y por lo tanto, ignorando las correlaciones) da como resultado una elipse mucho más grande que no lo hacereflejar la verdadera distribución. El tamaño más grande de esta elipse es el resultado de los términos fuera de la diagonal de la matriz de covarianza que se establece en cero, y corresponde al agente que calcula en error la incertidumbre en la probabilidad de que cada dimensión del contrato se esté cumpliendo. Esto, a su vez, lo lleva a calcular mal la incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada de un contrato (que se muestra en la Figura 1 como var (E [u]). 5. Comunicar la reputación al describir cómo un agente individual puede usar su propia experiencia directa de los resultados del contrato para estimar el probabil5 Tenga en cuenta que las gráficas no son suaves debido al hecho de que dado un número limitado de resultados del contrato, entonces la media de VA y VBNo varíe suavemente con ρ.1074 El sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) que un contrato multidimensional se cumplirá con éxito, ahora consideramos cómo los agentes dentro de un sistema de múltiples agentes abiertos pueden comunicarse estas estimaciones entre sí. Esto se conoce comúnmente como reputación y permite a los agentes con experiencia directa limitada de un proveedor tomar decisiones racionales. Tanto Jøsang como Ismail, y Teacy et al.Los modelos actuales por los cuales la reputación se comunica entre los agentes que utilizan las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución beta [6, 11]. Este enfoque es atractivo ya que estas estadísticas suficientes son agregaciones simples de los resultados del contrato (más precisamente, son simplemente el número total de contratos observados, N, y el número de estos que se cumplieron con éxito, n). Según el marco probabilístico de la distribución beta, los informes de reputación de esta forma pueden simplemente agregarse con una experiencia directa de los agentes, para obtener una estimación más precisa basada en un conjunto más amplio de resultados del contrato. Podemos extender inmediatamente este enfoque al caso multidimensional considerado aquí, al requerir que los agentes intercambien las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet en lugar de la distribución beta. En este caso, para cada par de dimensiones (es decir, A y B), los agentes deben comunicar un vector de resultados del contrato, n, que son las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet, dadas por: n = <nab ij> ∀a,b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Por lo tanto, un agente puede comunicar las estadísticas suficientes de su propia distribución de Dirichlet en términos de solo 2d (d - 1) (donde Des el número de dimensiones del contrato). Por ejemplo, en el caso de tres dimensiones, n, viene dada por: N = <NAB 00, NAB 01, NAB 10, NAB 11, NAC 00, NAC 01, NAC 10, NAC 11, NBC 00, NBC 01, NBC10, NBC 11> y, por lo tanto, grandes conjuntos de resultados del contrato pueden comunicarse dentro de un tamaño de mensaje relativamente pequeño, sin pérdida de información. Una vez más, los agentes que reciben estas estadísticas suficientes pueden simplemente agregarlas con su propia experiencia directa para obtener una estimación más precisa de la confiabilidad de un proveedor. Finalmente, observamos que, si bien no es el foco de nuestro trabajo aquí, al adoptar el mismo enfoque de principios que Jøsang e Ismail, y Teacy et al., Muchas de las técnicas que han desarrollado (como descuentos en informes de agentes poco confiables,y filtrar informes inconsistentes de agentes egoístas) pueden aplicarse directamente dentro de este modelo multidimensional. Sin embargo, ahora consideramos un nuevo problema que surge en los modelos individuales y multidimensionales, a saber, los problemas que surgen cuando tales estadísticas agregadas suficientes se propagan dentro de las redes de agentes descentralizados.6. La propagación del rumor dentro de los sistemas de reputación en la sección anterior, describimos el uso de estadísticas suficientes para comunicar la reputación, y demostramos que al agregar los resultados del contrato juntos en estas estadísticas suficientes, una gran cantidad de resultados del contrato se pueden representar y comunicar en una forma compacta. Si bien, esta es una propiedad atractiva, puede ser problemática en la práctica, ya que la procedencia individual de cada resultado del contrato se pierde en la agregación. Por lo tanto, para garantizar una estimación precisa, el sistema de reputación debe garantizar que cada observación de un resultado del contrato se incluya dentro de las estadísticas agregadas no más de una vez. Dentro de un sistema de reputación centralizado, donde todos los agentes informan su experiencia directa a un centro de confianza, dicho doble recuento de resultados del contrato es fácil de evitar. Sin embargo, en un sistema de reputación descentralizado, donde los agentes se comunican la reputación entre sí, y agregan su experiencia directa con estos informes de reputación sobre la marcha, evitar el conteo doble es mucho más difícil.A1 A2 A3 ¨ ¨ ¨ ¨ ¨..B e T N1 N1 N1 + N2 Figura 3: Ejemplo de propagación de rumores en un sistema de reputación descentralizado. Por ejemplo, considere el caso que se muestra en la Figura 3 donde tres agentes (A1 ... A3), cada uno con cierta experiencia directa de un proveedor, comparten informes de reputación con respecto a este proveedor. Si el Agente A1 proporcionara su estimación a los Agentes A2 y A3 en forma de estadísticas suficientes de su distribución de Dirichlet, entonces estos agentes pueden agregar estos resultados del contrato con los suyos y, por lo tanto, obtener estimaciones más precisas. Si en una etapa posterior, el Agente A2 enviara su vector agregado de los resultados del contrato al Agente A3, entonces el Agente A3 no está al tanto de la historia completa de los intercambios, puede intentar combinar estos resultados del contrato con su propio vector agregado. Sin embargo, dado que ambos vectores contienen una contribución del Agente A1, estos se contarán dos veces en el vector agregado final, y dará como resultado una estimación sesgada y exagerada. Esto se denomina propagación de rumores o incesto de datos en la literatura de fusión de datos [9]. Una posible solución sería identificar de manera única la fuente de cada resultado del contrato, y luego propagar cada vector, junto con su etiqueta, a través de la red. Por lo tanto, los agentes pueden identificar observaciones idénticas que han llegado a través de diferentes rutas, y después de eliminar los duplicados, pueden agregarlas juntas para formar sus estimaciones. Si bien esto parece ser atractivo en principio, por varias razones, no siempre es una solución viable en la práctica [12]. En primer lugar, los agentes pueden no desear que sus resultados contractuales etiquetados de forma única sean aprobados en un sistema abierto, ya que dicha información puede tener un significado comercial o práctico que podría usarse para su desventaja. Como tal, los agentes solo pueden estar dispuestos a intercambiar resultados de contrato identificables con un pequeño número de otros agentes (tal vez aquellos con los que tienen algún tipo de relación recíproca). En segundo lugar, el hecho de que no haya una agregación de los resultados del contrato a medida que pasan por la red significa que el tamaño del mensaje aumenta con el tiempo, y el tamaño final de estos mensajes está limitado solo por el número de agentes dentro del sistema (posiblemente un extremadamente un extremadamente un extremadamenteGran número para un sistema global). Finalmente, en realidad puede ser difícil asignar etiquetas globalmente agradables, consistentes y únicas para cada agente dentro de un sistema abierto. En la siguiente sección, desarrollamos una nueva solución al problema de la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados. Nuestra solución se basa en un enfoque desarrollado dentro del área de seguimiento de objetivos y fusión de datos [9]. Evita la necesidad de identificar de manera exclusiva a un agente, permite a los agentes restringir el número de otros agentes a los que revelan sus estimaciones privadas y, sin embargo, aún permite que la información se propague en toda la red.6.1 Información privada y compartida Nuestra solución a la propagación de rumores dentro de los sistemas de reputación descentralizados introduce la noción de información privada que un agente sabe que no se ha comunicado a ningún otro agente e información compartida que se haya comunicado o recibida de otro agente. Por lo tanto, el agente puede descomponer su vector de resultado del contrato, n, en dos vectores, uno privado, np, que no se ha comunicado a otro agente, y uno compartido, ns, que ha sido compartido o recibido de otro, otroAgente: N = NP + NS (19) Ahora, cada vez que un agente comunica la reputación, comunica sus vectores privados y compartidos por separado. Ambos el origen sexto intl. Conf.En agentes autónomos y sistemas de múltiples agentes (AAMAS 07) 1075 inatando y receptores agentes luego actualizan sus dos vectores de manera adecuada. Para comprender esto, considere el caso de que el Agente Aα envía sus vectores de resultados de contratos privados y compartidos, Nα P y Nα S, al agente Aβ que tiene resultados de contrato privados y compartidos Nβ P y Nβ S. Cada agente actualiza sus vectores de los resultados del contrato de acuerdo con el siguiente procedimiento: • Agente de origen: Una vez que el agente de origen ha enviado sus vectores de resultados de contrato compartidos y privados a otro agente, su información privada ya no es privada. Por lo tanto, debe eliminar los resultados del contrato que estaban en su vector privado y agregarlos a su vector compartido: Nα S ← Nα S + Nα P Nα P ← ∅.• Agente receptor: el objetivo del agente receptor es acumular los resultados del contrato de número más grande (ya que esto dará como resultado la estimación más precisa) sin incluir información compartida de sí mismo y del otro agente (ya que esto puede dar lugar a un doble recuento del contratoresultados). Tiene dos opciones dependiendo del número total de resultados del contrato6 dentro de su propio vector compartido, Nβ S, y dentro del agente de origen, Nα s. Por lo tanto, actualiza su vector de acuerdo con el siguiente procedimiento: - Nβ S> Nα S: Si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un mayor número de resultados del contrato que el del vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente combina su vector compartidoCon el vector privado del agente de origen: Nβ S ← Nβ S + Nα P Nβ Punned.- Nβ S <Nα s: Alternativamente, si el vector compartido de los agentes receptores representa un menor número de resultados del contrato que el del vector compartido del agente de origen, entonces el agente receptor descarta su propio vector compartido y forma uno nuevo de los privados y el privado y el privado y elVectores compartidos del agente de origen: Nβ S ← Nα S + Nα P Nβ P Sin cambios. En el caso de que Nβ S = Nα s, cualquiera de las opciones es apropiada. Una vez que el agente receptor ha actualizado sus conjuntos, utiliza los resultados del contrato dentro de ambos para formar su estimación de confianza. Si los agentes reciben varios vectores simultáneamente, este enfoque se generaliza al agente receptor utilizando el vector compartido más grande y los vectores privados de sí mismo y todos los agentes de origen para formar su nuevo vector compartido. Este procedimiento tiene una serie de propiedades atractivas. En primer lugar, dado que los resultados del contrato en un vector compartido de agentes nunca se combinan con los del vector compartido de otro agente, los resultados que se originaron en el mismo agente nunca se combinan y, por lo tanto, la propagación de rumores se evita por completo. Sin embargo, dado que el agente receptor puede descartar su propio vector compartido y adoptar el vector compartido del agente de origen, la información aún se propaga alrededor de la red. Además, dado que los resultados del contrato se agregan juntos dentro de los vectores privados y compartidos, el tamaño del mensaje es constante y no aumenta a medida que aumenta el número de interacciones. Finalmente, un agente solo comunica sus propios resultados de contrato privado a sus vecinos inmediatos. Si este agente 6 tiene en cuenta que esto puede calcularse a partir de n = NAB 00 +NAB 01 +NAB 10 +NAB 11. Posteriormente lo pasa, lo hace como información agregada no identificable dentro de su información compartida. Por lo tanto, un agente puede limitar el número de agentes con los que está dispuesto a revelar resultados del contrato identificables y, sin embargo, estos resultados del contrato aún pueden propagarse dentro de la red y, por lo tanto, mejorar las estimaciones de otros agentes. A continuación, demostramos empíricamente que estas propiedades pueden realizarse en la práctica.6.2 Comparación empírica Para evaluar la efectividad de este procedimiento, simulamos redes aleatorias que consisten en diez agentes. Cada agente tiene cierta experiencia directa de interactuar con un proveedor (como se describe en la Sección 4.3). En cada iteración de la simulación, interactúa con sus vecinos inmediatos e intercambia informes de reputación a través de las estadísticas suficientes de sus distribuciones de Dirichlet. Comparamos nuestra solución con dos de las alternativas descentralizadas más obvias: • Información privada y compartida: los agentes siguen el procedimiento descrito en la sección anterior. Es decir, mantienen vectores privados y compartidos de resultados contratados separados, y en cada iteración comunican estos dos vectores a sus vecinos inmediatos.• Propagación de rumores: los agentes no diferencian entre resultados de contratos privados y compartidos. En la primera iteración comunican todos los resultados del contrato que constituyen su experiencia directa. En iteraciones posteriores, propagan los resultados del contrato que reciben de cualquiera de los vecinos, a todos sus otros vecinos inmediatos.• Solo información privada: los agentes solo comunican los resultados del contrato que constituyen su experiencia directa. En todos los casos, en cada iteración, los agentes usan la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular sus estimaciones de confianza. Comparamos estos tres enfoques descentralizados con un sistema de reputación centralizado: • Reputación centralizada: todos los agentes pasan su experiencia directa a un sistema de reputación centralizado que los agrega juntos y revela esta estimación a cada agente. Esta solución centralizada hace que el uso más efectivo de la información esté disponible en la red. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los problemas del mundo real exigen soluciones descentralizadas debido a la escalabilidad, la modularidad y las preocupaciones de comunicación. Por lo tanto, esta solución centralizada se incluye ya que representa el caso óptimo y nos permite comparar nuestra solución descentralizada. Los resultados de estas comparaciones se muestran en la Figura 4. Aquí mostramos la suma del contenido de información de la matriz de covarianza de cada agente (calculada como se discutió anteriormente en la Sección 4.3), para cada uno de estos cuatro enfoques diferentes. Primero observamos que cuando solo se comunica la información privada, no hay cambios en la información después de la primera iteración. Una vez que cada agente ha recibido la experiencia directa de sus vecinos inmediatos, no se puede lograr más aumento en la información. Esto representa la comunicación mínima, y exhibe la información total más baja de los cuatro casos. A continuación, observamos que en el caso de la propagación del rumor, el contenido de información aumenta continuamente y supera rápidamente el resultado de la reputación centralizada. El hecho de que el caso de propagación de rumores exceda incorrectamente este límite, indica que cuenta continuamente los mismos resultados del contrato que rodean la red, en la creencia de que son eventos independientes. Finalmente, observamos que el uso de información privada y compartida representa un compromiso entre el caso solo de información privada y el caso de reputación centralizado. Todavía se permite que la información se propague alrededor de la red, sin embargo, se eliminan los rumores. Como antes, también trazamos una sola instancia de las estimaciones de confianza de un agente (es decir, ˆp (x) y cov (p (x))) como un conjunto de elipses en un 1076 el sexto intl.

Como se esperaba, el sistema de reputación centralizado logra la mejor estimación de la verdadera distribución, ya que utiliza la experiencia directa de todos los agentes. El caso de solo información privada muestra la elipse más grande, ya que propaga la menor información en la red. El caso de propagación de rumores muestra la elipse más pequeña, pero es inconsistente con la distribución real P (x). Por lo tanto, la propagación de rumores en torno a la red y los resultados del contrato con doble recuento en la creencia de que son eventos independientes, resulta en una estimación demasiado confidencial. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución, utilizando vectores separados de información privada y compartida, nos permite propagar más información que el caso de solo información privada, pero evitamos completamente los problemas de propagación de rumores. Finalmente, consideramos el efecto que esto tiene en el cálculo de los agentes de la utilidad esperada del contrato. Asumimos la misma función de utilidad que se usa en la Sección 4.3 (es decir, U (OA = 1) = 6 y U (OB = 1) = 2), y en la Tabla 1 presentamos la estimación de la utilidad esperada, y su desviación estándar calculadaPara los cuatro casos por un solo agente en la iteración cinco (después de que la comunicación haya dejado de tener más efecto para todos los métodos que no sean propagación de rumores). Observamos que el caso de propagación de rumores es claramente inconsistente con el sistema de reputación centralizado, ya que su desviación estándar es demasiado pequeña y no refleja la verdadera incertidumbre en la utilidad esperada, dados los resultados del contrato. Sin embargo, observamos que nuestra solución representa el caso más cercano al sistema de reputación centralizado y, por lo tanto, logra propagar información en toda la red, al tiempo que evita el sesgo y la exceso de confianza. La diferencia exacta entre TI y el sistema de reputación centralizado depende de la topología de la red y de la historia de los intercambios que tienen lugar dentro de él.7. Conclusiones En este documento abordamos la necesidad de un modelo probabilístico de confianza de principios de confianza computacional que se ocupa de contratos que tienen múltiples dimensiones correlacionadas. Nuestro punto de partida fue un agente que estimó la utilidad esperada de un contrato, y demostramos que esto lleva a un modelo de confianza computacional que utiliza la distribución de Dirichlet para calcular una estimación de confianza a partir de la experiencia directa de un agente. Luego mostramos cómo los agentes pueden usar las estadísticas suficientes de esta distribución de Dirichlet para representar y comunicar reputación dentro de un sistema de reputación descentralizado, y presentamos una solución a la propagación de rumores dentro de estos sistemas. Nuestro trabajo futuro en esta área es extender el intercambio de reputación al caso donde los contratos no son homogéneos. Es decir, no todos los agentes observan las mismas dimensiones de contrato. Esta es una extensión desafiante, ya que en este caso, las estadísticas suficientes de la distribución de Dirichlet no se pueden usar directamente.

        "{reece,sjrob}@robots.ox.ac.uk 2 Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO17 1BJ, UK. {acr,nrj}@ecs.soton.ac.uk ABSTRACT In this paper we develop a novel probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",
        "Our starting point is to consider an agent attempting to estimate the utility of a contract, and we show that this leads to a model of computational trust whereby an agent must determine a vector of estimates that represent the probability that any dimension of the contract will be successfully fulfilled, and a covariance matrix that describes the uncertainty and correlations in these probabilities.",
        "We present a formalism based on the Dirichlet distribution that allows an agent to calculate these probabilities and correlations from their direct experience of contract outcomes, and we show that this leads to superior estimates compared to an alternative approach using multiple independent beta distributions.",
        "We then show how agents may use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution to communicate and fuse reputation within a decentralised reputation system.",
        "Finally, we present a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within such systems.",
        "This solution uses the notion of private and shared information, and provides estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding bias and overconfidence.",
        "Categories and Subject Descriptors I.2.11 [Distributed Artificial Intelligence]: Intelligent agents General Terms Algorithms, Design, Theory 1.",
        "INTRODUCTION The role of computational models of trust within multi-agent systems in particular, and open distributed systems in general, has recently generated a great deal of research interest.",
        "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
        "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
        "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
        "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
        "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
        "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
        "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
        "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
        "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
        "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
        "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
        "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
        "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",
        "To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",
        "The starting point for our work is to consider how an agent can estimate the utility that it will derive from interacting with a supplier.",
        "Here we use standard approaches from the literature of data fusion (since this is a well developed field where the notion of multi-dimensional correlated estimates is well established1 ) to show that this naturally leads to a trust model where the agent must estimate probabilities and correlations over 1 In this context, the multiple dimensions typically represent the physical coordinates of a target being tracked, and correlations arise through the operation and orientation of sensors. 1070 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS multiple dimensions.",
        "Building upon this, we then devise a novel trust model that addresses the three desiderata discussed above.",
        "In more detail, in this paper we extend the state of the art in four key ways: 1.",
        "We devise a novel multi-dimensional probabilistic trust model that enables an agent to estimate the expected utility of a contract, by estimating (i) the probability that each contract dimension will be successfully fulfilled, and (ii) the correlations between these estimates. 2.",
        "We present an exact probabilistic model based upon the Dirichlet distribution that allows agents to use their direct experience of contract outcomes to calculate the probabilities and correlations described above.",
        "We then benchmark this solution and show that it leads to good estimates. 3.",
        "We show that agents can use the sufficient statistics of this Dirichlet distribution in order to exchange reputation reports with one another.",
        "The sufficient statistics represent aggregations of their direct experience, and thus, express contract outcomes in a compact format with no loss of information. 4.",
        "We show that, while being efficient, the aggregation of contract outcomes can lead to double counting, and rumour propagation, in decentralised reputation systems.",
        "Thus, we present a novel solution based upon the idea of private and shared information.",
        "We show that it yields estimates consistent with a centralised reputation system, whilst maintaining the anonymity of the agents, and avoiding overconfidence.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: in section 2 we review related work.",
        "In section 3 we present our notation for a single dimensional contract, before introducing our multi-dimensional trust model in section 4.",
        "In sections 5 and 6 we discuss communicating reputation, and present our solution to rumour propagation in decentralised reputation systems.",
        "We conclude in section 7. 2.",
        "RELATED WORK The need for a multi-dimensional trust model has been recognised by a number of researchers.",
        "Sabater and Sierra present a model of reputation, in which agents form contracts based on multiple variables (such as delivery date and quality), and define impressions as subjective evaluations of the outcome of these contracts.",
        "They provide heuristic approaches to combining these impressions to form a measure they call subjective reputation.",
        "Likewise, Griffiths decomposes overall trust into a number of different dimensions such as success, cost, timeliness and quality [4].",
        "In his case, each dimension is scored as a real number that represents a comparative value with no strong semantic meaning.",
        "He develops an heuristic rule to update these values based on the direct experiences of the individual agent, and an heuristic function that takes the individual trust dimensions and generates a single scalar that is then used to select between suppliers.",
        "Whilst, he comments that the trust values could have some associated confidence level, heuristics for updating these levels are not presented.",
        "Gujral et al. take a similar approach and present a trust model over multiple domain specific dimensions [5].",
        "They define multidimensional goal requirements, and evaluate an expected payoff based on a suppliers estimated behaviour.",
        "These estimates are, however, simple aggregations over the direct experience of several agents, and there is no measure of the uncertainty.",
        "Nevertheless, they show that agents who select suppliers based on these multiple dimensions outperform those who consider just a single one.",
        "By contrast, a number of researchers have presented more principled computational trust models based on probability theory, albeit limited to a single dimension.",
        "Jøsang and Ismail describe the Beta Reputation System whereby the reputation of an agent is compiled from the positive and negative reports from other agents who have interacted with it [6].",
        "The beta distribution represents a natural choice for representing these binary outcomes, and it provides a principled means of representing uncertainty.",
        "Moreover, they provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques to deal with reputations that may change over time.",
        "Likewise, Teacy et al. use the beta distribution to describe an agents belief in the probability that another agent will successfully fulfill its commitments [11].",
        "They present a formalism using a beta distribution that allows the agent to estimate this probability based upon its direct experience, and again they use the sufficient statistics of this distribution to communicate this estimate to other agents.",
        "They provide a number of extensions to this initial model, and, in particular, they consider that agents may not always truthfully report their trust estimates.",
        "Thus, they present a principled approach to detecting and removing inconsistent reports.",
        "Our work builds upon these more principled approaches.",
        "However, the starting point of our approach is to consider an agent that is attempting to estimate the expected utility of a contract.",
        "We show that estimating this expected utility requires that an agent must estimate the probability with which the supplier will fulfill its contract.",
        "In the single-dimensional case, this naturally leads to a trust model using the beta distribution (as per Jøsang and Ismail and Teacy et al.).",
        "However, we then go on to extend this analysis to multiple dimensions, where we use the natural extension of the beta distribution, namely the Dirichlet distribution, to represent the agents belief over multiple dimensions. 3.",
        "SINGLE-DIMENSIONAL TRUST Before presenting our multi-dimensional trust model, we first introduce the notation and formalism that we will use by describing the more familiar single dimensional case.",
        "We consider an agent who must decide whether to engage in a future contract with a supplier.",
        "This contract will lead to some outcome, o, and we consider that o = 1 if the contract is successfully fulfilled, and o = 0 if not2 .",
        "In order for the agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract.",
        "We assume that in the case that the contract is successfully fulfilled, the agent derives a utility u(o = 1), otherwise it receives no utility3 .",
        "Now, given that the agent is uncertain of the reliability with which the supplier will fulfill the contract, it should consider the expected utility that it will derive, E[U], and this is given by: E[U] = p(o = 1)u(o = 1) (1) where p(o = 1) is the probability that the supplier will successfully fulfill the contract.",
        "However, whilst u(o = 1) is known by the agent, p(o = 1) is not.",
        "The best the agent can do is to determine a distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) given its direct experience of previous contract outcomes.",
        "Given that it has been able to do so, it can then determine an estimate of the expected utility4 of the contract, E[E[U]], and a measure of its uncertainty in this expected utility, Var(E[U]).",
        "This uncertainty is important since a risk averse agent may make a decision regarding a contract, 2 Note that we only consider binary contract outcomes, although extending this to partial outcomes is part of our future work. 3 Clearly this can be extended to the case where some utility is derived from an unsuccessful outcome. 4 Note that this is often called the expected expected utility, and this is the notation that we adopt here [2].",

        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 1071 not only on its estimate of the expected utility of the contract, but also on the probability that the expected utility will exceed some minimum amount.",
        "These two properties are given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(o = 1)u(o = 1) (2) Var(E[U]) = Var(p(o = 1))u(o = 1)2 (3) where ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) are the estimate and uncertainty of the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, and are calculated from the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) that the agent determines from its direct experience.",
        "The utility based approach that we present here provides an attractive motivation for this model of Teacy et al. [11].",
        "Now, in the case of binary contract outcomes, the beta distribution is the natural choice to represent the distribution over possible values of p(o = 1) since within Bayesian statistics this well known to be the conjugate prior for binomial observations [3].",
        "By adopting the beta distribution, we can calculate ˆp(o = 1) and Var(p(o = 1)) using standard results, and thus, if an agent observed N previous contracts of which n were successfully fulfilled, then: ˆp(o = 1) = n + 1 N + 2 and: Var(p(o = 1)) = (n + 1)(N − n + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) Note that as expected, the greater the number of contracts the agent observes, the smaller the variance term Var(p(o = 1)), and, thus, the less the uncertainty regarding the probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1). 4.",
        "MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TRUST We now extend the description above, to consider contracts between suppliers and agents that are represented by multiple dimensions, and hence the success or failure of a contract can be decomposed into the success or failure of each separate dimension.",
        "Consider again the example of the supply chain that specifies the timeliness, quantity, and quality of the goods that are to be delivered.",
        "Thus, within our trust model oa = 1 now indicates a successful outcome over dimension a of the contract and oa = 0 indicates an unsuccessful one.",
        "A contract outcome, X, is now composed of a vector of individual contract part outcomes (e.g.",
        "X = {oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . . }).",
        "Given a multi-dimensional contract whose outcome is described by the vector X, we again consider that in order for an agent to make a rational decision, it should consider the utility that it will derive from this contract.",
        "To this end, we can make the general statement that the expected utility of a contract is given by: E[U] = p(X)U(X)T (4) where p(X) is a joint probability distribution over all possible contract outcomes: p(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ p(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) p(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (5) and U(X) is the utility derived from these possible outcomes: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1, ob = 0, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 1, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) u(oa = 0, ob = 1, oc = 0, . . .) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (6) As before, whilst U(X) is known to the agent, the probability distribution p(X) is not.",
        "Rather, given the agents direct experience of the supplier, the agent can determine a distribution over possible values for p(X).",
        "In the single dimensional case, a beta distribution was the natural choice over possible values of p(o = 1).",
        "In the multi-dimensional case, where p(X) itself is a vector of probabilities, the corresponding natural choice is the Dirichlet distribution, since this is a conjugate prior for multinomial proportions [3].",
        "Given this distribution, the agent is then able to calculate an estimate of the expected utility of a contract.",
        "As before, this estimate is itself represented by an expected value given by: E[E[U]] = ˆp(X)U(X)T (7) and a variance, describing the uncertainty in this expected utility: Var(E[U]) = U(X)Cov(p(X))U(X)T (8) where: Cov(p(X)) E[(p(X) − ˆp(X))(p(X) − ˆp(X))T ] (9) Thus, whilst the single dimensional case naturally leads to a trust model in which the agents attempt to derive an estimate of probability that a contract will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(o = 1), along with a scalar variance that describes the uncertainty in this probability, Var(p(o = 1)), in this case, the agents must derive an estimate of a vector of probabilities, ˆp(X), along with a covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), that represents the uncertainty in p(X) given the observed contractual outcomes.",
        "At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract.",
        "However, in the multi-dimensional case the agent must determine ˆp(X), and since this describes the probability of all possible contract outcomes, including those that are completely un-fulfilled, this direct semantic interpretation is not present.",
        "In the next section, we describe the exemplar utility function that we shall use in the remainder of this paper. 4.1 Exemplar Utility Function The approach described so far is completely general, in that it applies to any utility function of the form described above, and also applies to the estimation of any joint probability distribution.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, for illustrative purposes, we shall limit the discussion to the simplest possible utility function that exhibits a dependence upon the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
        "That is, we consider the case that expected utility is dependent only on the marginal probabilities of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, rather than the full joint probabilities: U(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ u(oa = 1) u(ob = 1) u(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (10) Thus, ˆp(X) is a vector estimate of the probability of each contract dimension being successfully fulfilled, and maintains the clear semantic interpretation seen in the single dimensional case: ˆp(X) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ˆp(oa = 1) ˆp(ob = 1) ˆp(oc = 1) ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (11) The correlations between the contract dimensions affect the uncertainty in the expected utility.",
        "To see this, consider the covariance 1072 The Sixth Intl.",
        "Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) matrix that describes this uncertainty, Cov(p(X)), is now given by: Cov(p(X)) = ⎛ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ Va Cab Cac . . .",
        "Cab Vb Cbc . . .",
        "Cac Cbc Vc . . . ... ... ... ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (12) In this matrix, the diagonal terms, Va, Vb and Vc, represent the uncertainties in p(oa = 1), p(ob = 1) and p(oc = 1) within p(X).",
        "The off-diagonal terms, Cab, Cac and Cbc, represent the correlations between these probabilities.",
        "In the next section, we use the Dirichlet distribution to calculate both ˆp(X) and Cov(p(X)) from an agents direct experience of previous contract outcomes.",
        "We first illustrate why this is necessary by considering an alternative approach to modelling multi-dimensional contracts whereby an agent na¨ıvely assumes that the dimensions are independent, and thus, it models each individually by separate beta distributions (as in the single dimensional case we presented in section 3).",
        "This is actually equivalent to setting the off-diagonal terms within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), to zero.",
        "However, doing so can lead an agent to assume that its estimate of the expected utility of the contract is more accurate than it actually is.",
        "To illustrate this, consider a specific scenario with the following values: u(oa = 1) = u(ob = 1) = 1 and Va = Vb = 0.2.",
        "In this case, Var(E[U]) = 0.4(1 + Cab), and thus, if the correlation Cab is ignored then the variance in the expected utility is 0.4.",
        "However, if the contract outcomes are completely correlated then Cab = 1 and Var(E[U]) is actually 0.8.",
        "Thus, in order to have an accurate estimate of the variance of the expected contract utility, and to make a rational decision, it is essential that the agent is able to represent and calculate these correlation terms.",
        "In the next section, we describe how an agent may do so using the Dirichlet distribution. 4.2 The Dirichlet Distribution In this section, we describe how the agent may use its direct experience of previous contracts, and the standard results of the Dirichlet distribution, to determine an estimate of the probability that each contract dimension will be successful fulfilled, ˆp(X), and a measure of the uncertainties in these probabilities that expresses the correlations between the contract dimensions, Cov(p(X)).",
        "We first consider the calculation of ˆp(X) and the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)).",
        "As described above, the derivation of these results is identical to the case of the single dimensional beta distribution, where out of N contract outcomes, n are successfully fulfilled.",
        "In the multi-dimensional case, however, we have a vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} that represents the number of outcomes for which each of the individual contract dimensions were successfully fulfilled.",
        "Thus, in terms of the standard Dirichlet parameters where αa = na + 1 and α0 = N + 2, the agent can estimate the probability of this contract dimension being successfully fulfilled: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 and can also calculate the variance in any contract dimension: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) However, calculating the off-diagonal terms within Cov(p(X)) is more complex since it is necessary to consider the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
        "Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j.",
        "For example, nab 10 represents the number of contracts for which oa = 1 and ob = 0.",
        "Now, using the standard Dirichlet notation, we can define αab ij nab ij + 1 for all i and j taking values 0 and 1, and then, to calculate the cross-correlations between contract pairs a and b, we note that the Dirichlet distribution over pair-wise joint probabilities is: Prob(pab) = Kab i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j)αab ij −1 where: i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = j) = 1 and Kab is a normalising constant [3].",
        "From this we can derive pair-wise probability estimates and variances: E[p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij α0 (13) V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] = αab ij (α0 − αab ij ) α2 0(1 + α0) (14) where: α0 = i∈{0,1} j∈{0,1} αab ij (15) and in fact, α0 = N + 2, where N is the total number of contracts observed.",
        "Likewise, we can express the covariance in these pairwise probabilities in similar terms: C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)] = −αab ij αab mn α2 0(1 + α0) Finally, we can use the expression: p(oa = 1) = j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) to determine the covariance Cab.",
        "To do so, we first simplify the notation by defining V ab ij V [p(oa = i, ob = j)] and Cab ijmn C[p(oa = i, ob = j), p(oa = m, ob = n)].",
        "The covariance for the probability of positive contract outcomes is then the covariance between j∈{0,1} p(oa = 1, ob = j) and i∈{0,1} p(oa = i, ob = 1), and thus: Cab = Cab 1001 + Cab 1101 + Cab 1011 + V ab 11 .",
        "Thus, given a set of contract outcomes that represent the agents previous interactions with a supplier, we may use the Dirichlet distribution to calculate the mean and variance of the probability of any contract dimension being successfully fulfilled (i.e. ˆp(oa = 1) and Va).",
        "In addition, by a somewhat more complex procedure we can also calculate the correlations between these probabilities (i.e.",
        "Cab).",
        "This allows us to calculate an estimate of the probability that any contract dimension will be successfully fulfilled, ˆp(X), and also represent the uncertainty and correlations in these probabilities by the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)).",

        "Note that as expected, when the dimensions of the contract outcomes are uncorrelated (i.e. ρ = 0), then both approaches give the same results.",
        "However, the value of using our formalism with the full Dirichlet distribution is shown when the correlation between the dimensions increases (either negatively or positively).",
        "As can be seen, if we approximate the Dirichlet distribution with multiple independent beta distributions, all of the correlation information contained within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), is lost, and thus, the information content of the matrix is much lower.",
        "The loss of this correlation information leads the variance of the expected utility of the contract to be incorrect (either over or under estimated depending on the correlation)5 , with the exact amount of mis-estimation depending on the actual utility function chosen (i.e. the values of u(oa = 1) and u(ob = 1)).",

        "That is, ˆp(X) determines the position of the center of the ellipse, Cov(p(X)) defines its size and shape.",
        "Note that whilst the ellipse resulting from the full Dirichlet formalism accurately reflects the true distribution (samples of which are plotted as points), that calculated by using multiple independent Beta distributions (and thus ignoring the correlations) results in a much larger ellipse that does not reflect the true distribution.",

        "This is commonly referred to as reputation and allows agents with limited direct experience of a supplier to make rational decisions.",
        "Both Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al. present models whereby reputation is communicated between agents using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution [6, 11].",
        "This approach is attractive since these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of contracts observed, N, and the number of these that were successfully fulfilled, n).",
        "Under the probabilistic framework of the beta distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agents own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.",
        "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",
        "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",
        "For instance, in the case of three dimensions, N, is given by: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information.",
        "Again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier.",
        "Finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here, by adopting the same principled approach as Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within this multi-dimensional model.",
        "However, we now go on to consider a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks. 6.",
        "RUMOUR PROPAGATION WITHIN REPUTATION SYSTEMS In the previous section, we described the use of sufficient statistics to communicate reputation, and we showed that by aggregating contract outcomes together into these sufficient statistics, a large number of contract outcomes can be represented and communicated in a compact form.",
        "Whilst, this is an attractive property, it can be problematic in practise, since the individual provenance of each contract outcome is lost in the aggregation.",
        "Thus, to ensure an accurate estimate, the reputation system must ensure that each observation of a contract outcome is included within the aggregated statistics no more than once.",
        "Within a centralised reputation system, where all agents report their direct experience to a trusted center, such double counting of contract outcomes is easy to avoid.",
        "However, in a decentralised reputation system, where agents communicate reputation to one another, and aggregate their direct experience with these reputation reports on-the-fly, avoiding double counting is much more difficult. a1 a2 a3 ¨ ¨¨ ¨¨ ¨¨B E T N1 N1 N1 + N2 Figure 3: Example of rumour propagation in a decentralised reputation system.",
        "For example, consider the case shown in figure 3 where three agents (a1 . . . a3), each with some direct experience of a supplier, share reputation reports regarding this supplier.",
        "If agent a1 were to provide its estimate to agents a2 and a3 in the form of the sufficient statistics of its Dirichlet distribution, then these agents can aggregate these contract outcomes with their own, and thus obtain more precise estimates.",
        "If at a later stage, agent a2 were to send its aggregate vector of contract outcomes to agent a3, then agent a3 being unaware of the full history of exchanges, may attempt to combine these contract outcomes with its own aggregated vector.",
        "However, since both vectors contain a contribution from agent a1, these will be counted twice in the final aggregated vector, and will result in a biased and overconfident estimate.",
        "This is termed rumour propagation or data incest in the data fusion literature [9].",
        "One possible solution would be to uniquely identify the source of each contract outcome, and then propagate each vector, along with its label, through the network.",
        "Agents can thus identify identical observations that have arrived through different routes, and after removing the duplicates, can aggregate these together to form their estimates.",
        "Whilst this appears to be attractive in principle, for a number of reasons, it is not always a viable solution in practise [12].",
        "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
        "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
        "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",
        "Finally, it may actually be difficult to assign globally agreeable, consistent, and unique labels for each agent within an open system.",
        "In the next section, we develop a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems.",
        "Our solution is based on an approach developed within the area of target tracking and data fusion [9].",
        "It avoids the need to uniquely identify an agent, it allows agents to restrict the number of other agents who they reveal their private estimates to, and yet it still allows information to propagate throughout the network. 6.1 Private and Shared Information Our solution to rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems introduces the notion of private information that an agent knows it has not communicated to any other agent, and shared information that has been communicated to, or received from, another agent.",
        "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

        "To understand this, consider the case that agent aα sends its private and shared contract outcome vectors, Nα p and Nα s , to agent aβ that itself has private and shared contract outcomes Nβ p and Nβ s .",
        "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
        "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
        "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
        "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
        "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
        "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
        "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
        "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
        "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
        "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
        "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
        "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
        "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
        "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
        "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",
        "Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3).",
        "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
        "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
        "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
        "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
        "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
        "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
        "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",
        "This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network.",
        "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
        "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",
        "The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4.",
        "Here we show the sum of the information content of each agents covariance matrix (calculated as discussed earlier in section 4.3), for each of these four different approaches.",
        "We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration.",
        "Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved.",
        "This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases.",
        "Next, we note that in the case of rumour propagation, the information content increases continually, and rapidly exceeds the centralised reputation result.",
        "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",
        "Finally, we note that using private and shared information represents a compromise between the private information only case and the centralised reputation case.",
        "Information is still allowed to propagate around the network, however rumours are eliminated.",

        "As expected, the centralised reputation system achieves the best estimate of the true distribution, since it uses the direct experience of all agents.",
        "The private information only case shows the largest ellipse since it propagates the least information around the network.",
        "The rumour propagation case shows the smallest ellipse, but it is inconsistent with the actual distribution p(X).",
        "Thus, propagating rumours around the network and double counting contract outcomes in the belief that they are independent events, results in an overconfident estimate.",
        "However, we note that our solution, using separate vectors of private and shared information, allows us to propagate more information than the private information only case, but we completely avoid the problems of rumour propagation.",
        "Finally, we consider the effect that this has on the agents calculation of the expected utility of the contract.",
        "We assume the same utility function as used in section 4.3 (i.e. u(oa = 1) = 6 and u(ob = 1) = 2), and in table 1 we present the estimate of the expected utility, and its standard deviation calculated for all four cases by a single agent at iteration five (after communication has ceased to have any further effect for all methods other than rumour propagation).",
        "We note that the rumour propagation case is clearly inconsistent with the centralised reputation system, since its standard deviation is too small and does not reflect the true uncertainty in the expected utility, given the contract outcomes.",
        "However, we observe that our solution represents the closest case to the centralised reputation system, and thus succeeds in propagating information throughout the network, whilst also avoiding bias and overconfidence.",
        "The exact difference between it and the centralised reputation system depends upon the topology of the network, and the history of exchanges that take place within it. 7.",
        "CONCLUSIONS In this paper we addressed the need for a principled probabilistic model of computational trust that deals with contracts that have multiple correlated dimensions.",

                "Both Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al. present models whereby reputation is communicated between agents using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution [6, 11].",
                "This approach is attractive since these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of contracts observed, N, and the number of these that were successfully fulfilled, n).",
                "Under the probabilistic framework of the beta distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agents own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.",
                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",
                "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",
                "For instance, in the case of three dimensions, N, is given by: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information.",
                "Again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier.",
                "Finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here, by adopting the same principled approach as Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within this multi-dimensional model.",
                "However, we now go on to consider a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks. 6.",
                "RUMOUR PROPAGATION WITHIN REPUTATION SYSTEMS In the previous section, we described the use of sufficient statistics to communicate reputation, and we showed that by aggregating contract outcomes together into these sufficient statistics, a large number of contract outcomes can be represented and communicated in a compact form.",

                "If at a later stage, agent a2 were to send its aggregate vector of contract outcomes to agent a3, then agent a3 being unaware of the full history of exchanges, may attempt to combine these contract outcomes with its own aggregated vector.",
                "However, since both vectors contain a contribution from agent a1, these will be counted twice in the final aggregated vector, and will result in a biased and overconfident estimate.",
                "This is termed rumour propagation or data incest in the data fusion literature [9].",
                "One possible solution would be to uniquely identify the source of each contract outcome, and then propagate each vector, along with its label, through the network.",
                "Agents can thus identify identical observations that have arrived through different routes, and after removing the duplicates, can aggregate these together to form their estimates.",
                "Whilst this appears to be attractive in principle, for a number of reasons, it is not always a viable solution in practise [12].",
                "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
                "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",
                "Finally, it may actually be difficult to assign globally agreeable, consistent, and unique labels for each agent within an open system.",

                "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

                "To understand this, consider the case that agent aα sends its private and shared contract outcome vectors, Nα p and Nα s , to agent aβ that itself has private and shared contract outcomes Nβ p and Nβ s .",
                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
                "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
                "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",
                "Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3).",
                "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
                "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
                "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
                "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",
                "This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network.",
                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
                "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",
                "The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4.",
                "Here we show the sum of the information content of each agents covariance matrix (calculated as discussed earlier in section 4.3), for each of these four different approaches.",
                "We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration.",
                "Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved.",
                "This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases.",

                "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",

                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",

                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",

                "At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract.",
                "However, in the multi-dimensional case the agent must determine ˆp(X), and since this describes the probability of all possible contract outcomes, including those that are completely un-fulfilled, this direct semantic interpretation is not present.",

                "This is actually equivalent to setting the off-diagonal terms within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), to zero.",

                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",

                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",

                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",

                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",

                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",

                "At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract.",

                "Thus, in order to have an accurate estimate of the variance of the expected contract utility, and to make a rational decision, it is essential that the agent is able to represent and calculate these correlation terms.",
                "In the next section, we describe how an agent may do so using the Dirichlet distribution. 4.2 The Dirichlet Distribution In this section, we describe how the agent may use its direct experience of previous contracts, and the standard results of the Dirichlet distribution, to determine an estimate of the probability that each contract dimension will be successful fulfilled, ˆp(X), and a measure of the uncertainties in these probabilities that expresses the correlations between the contract dimensions, Cov(p(X)).",
                "We first consider the calculation of ˆp(X) and the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)).",

                "In the multi-dimensional case, however, we have a vector {na, nb, nc, . . .} that represents the number of outcomes for which each of the individual contract dimensions were successfully fulfilled.",

                "Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j.",

                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",

                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",

                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",

                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",

                "We first consider the calculation of ˆp(X) and the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)).",

                "Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j.",

                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",

                "To understand this, consider the case that agent aα sends its private and shared contract outcome vectors, Nα p and Nα s , to agent aβ that itself has private and shared contract outcomes Nβ p and Nβ s .",
                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
                "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
                "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",
                "Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3).",
                "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
                "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
                "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
                "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",
                "This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network.",
                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
                "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",
                "The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4.",
                "Here we show the sum of the information content of each agents covariance matrix (calculated as discussed earlier in section 4.3), for each of these four different approaches.",
                "We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration.",
                "Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved.",
                "This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases.",
                "Next, we note that in the case of rumour propagation, the information content increases continually, and rapidly exceeds the centralised reputation result.",
                "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",

                "We note that the rumour propagation case is clearly inconsistent with the centralised reputation system, since its standard deviation is too small and does not reflect the true uncertainty in the expected utility, given the contract outcomes.",
                "However, we observe that our solution represents the closest case to the centralised reputation system, and thus succeeds in propagating information throughout the network, whilst also avoiding bias and overconfidence.",

                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
                "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
                "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",
                "To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",
                "The starting point for our work is to consider how an agent can estimate the utility that it will derive from interacting with a supplier.",

                "In the next section, we develop a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems.",

                "It avoids the need to uniquely identify an agent, it allows agents to restrict the number of other agents who they reveal their private estimates to, and yet it still allows information to propagate throughout the network. 6.1 Private and Shared Information Our solution to rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems introduces the notion of private information that an agent knows it has not communicated to any other agent, and shared information that has been communicated to, or received from, another agent.",
                "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
                "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
                "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",
                "Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3).",
                "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
                "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
                "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the <br>dirichlet distribution</br> in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
                "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",

                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
                "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",
                "The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4.",
                "Here we show the sum of the information content of each agents covariance matrix (calculated as discussed earlier in section 4.3), for each of these four different approaches.",
                "We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration.",
                "Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved.",
                "This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases.",

                "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",

                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",

                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",

                "Moreover, they provide a number of extensions to this initial model including an approach to exchanging reputation reports using the sufficient statistics of the beta distribution, methods to discount the opinions of agents who themselves have low reputation ratings, and techniques to deal with reputations that may change over time.",

                "MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TRUST We now extend the description above, to consider contracts between suppliers and agents that are represented by multiple dimensions, and hence the success or failure of a contract can be decomposed into the success or failure of each separate dimension.",

                "We first illustrate why this is necessary by considering an alternative approach to modelling multi-dimensional contracts whereby an agent na¨ıvely assumes that the dimensions are independent, and thus, it models each individually by separate beta distributions (as in the single dimensional case we presented in section 3).",
                "This is actually equivalent to setting the off-diagonal terms within the covariance matrix, Cov(p(X)), to zero.",
                "However, doing so can lead an agent to assume that its estimate of the expected utility of the contract is more accurate than it actually is.",

                "We first consider the calculation of ˆp(X) and the diagonal terms of the covariance matrix Cov(p(X)).",

                "Thus, in terms of the standard Dirichlet parameters where αa = na + 1 and α0 = N + 2, the agent can estimate the probability of this contract dimension being successfully fulfilled: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 and can also calculate the variance in any contract dimension: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) However, calculating the off-diagonal terms within Cov(p(X)) is more complex since it is necessary to consider the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
                "Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j.",

                "This approach is attractive since these sufficient statistics are simple aggregations of contract outcomes (more precisely, they are simply the total number of contracts observed, N, and the number of these that were successfully fulfilled, n).",
                "Under the probabilistic framework of the beta distribution, reputation reports in this form may simply be aggregated with an agents own direct experience, in order to gain a more precise estimate based on a larger set of contract outcomes.",
                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",
                "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",
                "For instance, in the case of three dimensions, N, is given by: N =< nab 00, nab 01, nab 10, nab 11, nac 00, nac 01, nac 10, nac 11, nbc 00, nbc 01, nbc 10, nbc 11 > and, hence, large sets of contract outcomes may be communicated within a relatively small message size, with no loss of information.",
                "Again, agents receiving these sufficient statistics may simply aggregate them with their own direct experience in order to gain a more precise estimate of the trustworthiness of a supplier.",
                "Finally, we note that whilst it is not the focus of our work here, by adopting the same principled approach as Jøsang and Ismail, and Teacy et al., many of the techniques that they have developed (such as discounting reports from unreliable agents, and filtering inconsistent reports from selfish agents) may be directly applied within this multi-dimensional model.",
                "However, we now go on to consider a new issue that arises in both the single and multi-dimensional models, namely the problems that arise when such aggregated sufficient statistics are propagated within decentralised agent networks. 6.",
                "RUMOUR PROPAGATION WITHIN REPUTATION SYSTEMS In the previous section, we described the use of sufficient statistics to communicate reputation, and we showed that by aggregating contract outcomes together into these sufficient statistics, a large number of contract outcomes can be represented and communicated in a compact form.",

                "Whilst this appears to be attractive in principle, for a number of reasons, it is not always a viable solution in practise [12].",
                "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
                "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",
                "Finally, it may actually be difficult to assign globally agreeable, consistent, and unique labels for each agent within an open system.",

                "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in <br>double counting</br> of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
                "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
                "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",
                "Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3).",
                "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
                "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
                "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
                "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",
                "This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network.",
                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
                "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",

                "Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved.",
                "This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases.",

                "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",

                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
                "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
                "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",
                "To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",
                "The starting point for our work is to consider how an agent can estimate the utility that it will derive from interacting with a supplier.",
                "Here we use standard approaches from the literature of data fusion (since this is a well developed field where the notion of multi-dimensional correlated estimates is well established1 ) to show that this naturally leads to a trust model where the agent must estimate probabilities and correlations over 1 In this context, the multiple dimensions typically represent the physical coordinates of a target being tracked, and correlations arise through the operation and orientation of sensors. 1070 978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS multiple dimensions.",

                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",
                "In this case, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), the agents must communicate a vector of contract outcomes, N, which are the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution, given by: N =< nab ij > ∀a, b, i ∈ {0, 1}, j ∈ {0, 1} (18) Thus, an agent is able to communicate the sufficient statistics of its own Dirichlet distribution in terms of just 2d(d − 1) numbers (where d is the number of contract dimensions).",

                "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
                "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",

                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",

                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, <br>rumour propagation</br> is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",

                "At this point, it is interesting to note that the estimate in the single dimensional case, ˆp(o = 1), has a clear semantic meaning in relation to trust; it is the agents belief in the probability of a supplier successfully fulfilling a contract.",

                "Thus, in terms of the standard Dirichlet parameters where αa = na + 1 and α0 = N + 2, the agent can estimate the probability of this contract dimension being successfully fulfilled: ˆp(oa = 1) = αa α0 = na + 1 N + 2 and can also calculate the variance in any contract dimension: Va = αa(α0 − αa) α2 0(1 + α0) = (na + 1)(N − na + 1) (N + 2)2(N + 3) However, calculating the off-diagonal terms within Cov(p(X)) is more complex since it is necessary to consider the correlations between the contract dimensions.",
                "Thus, for each pair of dimensions (i.e. a and b), we must consider all possible combinations of contract outcomes, and thus we define nab ij as the number of contract outcomes for which both oa = i and ob = j.",

                "We can immediately extend this approach to the multi-dimensional case considered here, by requiring that the agents exchange the sufficient statistics of the Dirichlet distribution instead of the beta distribution.",

                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",

                "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",
                "To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",

                "Our work builds upon these more principled approaches.",

                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
                "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
                "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",
                "To rectify this shortcoming, in this paper we develop a probabilistic model of computational trust that explicitly deals with correlated multi-dimensional contracts.",

                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
                "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
                "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",

                "To understand this, consider the case that agent aα sends its private and shared contract outcome vectors, Nα p and Nα s , to agent aβ that itself has private and shared contract outcomes Nβ p and Nβ s .",
                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
                "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
                "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",
                "Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3).",
                "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
                "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
                "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
                "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",
                "This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network.",
                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
                "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",
                "The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4.",
                "Here we show the sum of the information content of each agents covariance matrix (calculated as discussed earlier in section 4.3), for each of these four different approaches.",
                "We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration.",
                "Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved.",
                "This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases.",
                "Next, we note that in the case of rumour propagation, the information content increases continually, and rapidly exceeds the centralised reputation result.",
                "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",
                "Finally, we note that using private and shared information represents a compromise between the private information only case and the centralised reputation case.",

                "We note that the rumour propagation case is clearly inconsistent with the centralised reputation system, since its standard deviation is too small and does not reflect the true uncertainty in the expected utility, given the contract outcomes.",
                "However, we observe that our solution represents the closest case to the centralised reputation system, and thus succeeds in propagating information throughout the network, whilst also avoiding bias and overconfidence.",

                "In such systems, agents must typically choose between interaction partners, and in this context trust can be viewed to provide a means for agents to represent and estimate the reliability with which these interaction partners will fulfill their commitments.",
                "To date, however, much of the work within this area has used domain specific or ad-hoc trust metrics, and has focused on providing heuristics to evaluate and update these metrics using direct experience and reputation reports from other agents (see [8] for a review).",
                "Recent work has attempted to place the notion of computational trust within the framework of probability theory [6, 11].",
                "This approach allows many of the desiderata of computational trust models to be addressed through principled means.",
                "In particular: (i) it allows agents to update their estimates of the trustworthiness of a supplier as they acquire direct experience, (ii) it provides a natural framework for agents to express their uncertainty this trustworthiness, and, (iii) it allows agents to exchange, combine and filter reputation reports received from other agents.",
                "Whilst this approach is attractive, it is somewhat limited in that it has so far only considered single dimensional outcomes (i.e. whether the contract has succeeded or failed in its entirety).",
                "However, in many real world settings the success or failure of an interaction may be decomposed into several dimensions [7].",
                "This presents the challenge of combining these multiple dimensions into a single metric over which a decision can be made.",
                "Furthermore, these dimensions will typically also exhibit correlations.",
                "For example, a contract within a supply chain may specify criteria for timeliness, quality and quantity.",
                "A supplier who is suffering delays may attempt a trade-off between these dimensions by supplying the full amount late, or supplying as much as possible (but less than the quantity specified within the contract) on time.",
                "Thus, correlations will naturally arise between these dimensions, and hence, between the probabilities that describe the successful fulfillment of each contract dimension.",
                "To date, however, no such principled framework exists to describe these multi-dimensional contracts, nor the correlations between these dimensions (although some ad-hoc models do exist - see section 2 for more details).",

                "For example, consider the case shown in figure 3 where three agents (a1 . . . a3), each with some direct experience of a supplier, share reputation reports regarding this supplier.",
                "If agent a1 were to provide its estimate to agents a2 and a3 in the form of the sufficient statistics of its Dirichlet distribution, then these agents can aggregate these contract outcomes with their own, and thus obtain more precise estimates.",
                "If at a later stage, agent a2 were to send its aggregate vector of contract outcomes to agent a3, then agent a3 being unaware of the full history of exchanges, may attempt to combine these contract outcomes with its own aggregated vector.",
                "However, since both vectors contain a contribution from agent a1, these will be counted twice in the final aggregated vector, and will result in a biased and overconfident estimate.",
                "This is termed rumour propagation or data incest in the data fusion literature [9].",
                "One possible solution would be to uniquely identify the source of each contract outcome, and then propagate each vector, along with its label, through the network.",
                "Agents can thus identify identical observations that have arrived through different routes, and after removing the duplicates, can aggregate these together to form their estimates.",
                "Whilst this appears to be attractive in principle, for a number of reasons, it is not always a viable solution in practise [12].",
                "Firstly, agents may not actually wish to have their uniquely labelled contract outcomes passed around an open system, since such information may have commercial or practical significance that could be used to their disadvantage.",
                "As such, agents may only be willing to exchange identifiable contract outcomes with a small number of other agents (perhaps those that they have some sort of reciprocal relationship with).",
                "Secondly, the fact that there is no aggregation of the contract outcomes as they pass around the network means that the message size increases over time, and the ultimate size of these messages is bounded only by the number of agents within the system (possibly an extremely large number for a global system).",
                "Finally, it may actually be difficult to assign globally agreeable, consistent, and unique labels for each agent within an open system.",
                "In the next section, we develop a novel solution to the problem of rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems.",
                "Our solution is based on an approach developed within the area of target tracking and data fusion [9].",
                "It avoids the need to uniquely identify an agent, it allows agents to restrict the number of other agents who they reveal their private estimates to, and yet it still allows information to propagate throughout the network. 6.1 Private and Shared Information Our solution to rumour propagation within decentralised reputation systems introduces the notion of private information that an agent knows it has not communicated to any other agent, and shared information that has been communicated to, or received from, another agent.",
                "Thus, the agent can decompose its contract outcome vector, N, into two vectors, a private one, Np, that has not been communicated to another agent, and a shared one, Ns, that has been shared with, or received from, another agent: N = Np + Ns (19) Now, whenever an agent communicates reputation, it communicates both its private and shared vectors separately.",

                "To understand this, consider the case that agent aα sends its private and shared contract outcome vectors, Nα p and Nα s , to agent aβ that itself has private and shared contract outcomes Nβ p and Nβ s .",
                "Each agent updates its vectors of contract outcomes according to the following procedure: • Originating Agent: Once the originating agent has sent both its shared and private contract outcome vectors to another agent, its private information is no longer private.",
                "Thus, it must remove the contract outcomes that were in its private vector, and add them into its shared vector: Nα s ← Nα s + Nα p Nα p ← ∅. • Receiving Agent: The goal of the receiving agent is to accumulate the largest number contract outcomes (since this will result in the most precise estimate) without including shared information from both itself and the other agent (since this may result in double counting of contract outcomes).",
                "It has two choices depending on the total number of contract outcomes6 within its own shared vector, Nβ s , and within that of the originating agent, Nα s .",
                "Thus, it updates its vector according to the procedure below: - Nβ s > Nα s : If the receiving agents shared vector represents a greater number of contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the agent combines its shared vector with the private vector of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nβ s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged. - Nβ s < Nα s : Alternatively if the receiving agents shared vector represents a smaller number contract outcomes than that of the shared vector of the originating agent, then the receiving agent discards its own shared vector and forms a new one from both the private and shared vectors of the originating agent: Nβ s ← Nα s + Nα p Nβ p unchanged.",
                "In the case that Nβ s = Nα s then either option is appropriate.",
                "Once the receiving agent has updated its sets, it uses the contract outcomes within both to form its trust estimate.",
                "If agents receive several vectors simultaneously, this approach generalises to the receiving agent using the largest shared vector, and the private vectors of itself and all the originating agents to form its new shared vector.",
                "This procedure has a number of attractive properties.",
                "Firstly, since contract outcomes in an agents shared vector are never combined with those in the shared vector of another agent, outcomes that originated from the same agent are never combined together, and thus, rumour propagation is completely avoided.",
                "However, since the receiving agent may discard its own shared vector, and adopt the shared vector of the originating agent, information is still propagated around the network.",
                "Moreover, since contract outcomes are aggregated together within the private and shared vectors, the message size is constant and does not increase as the number of interactions increases.",
                "Finally, an agent only communicates its own private contract outcomes to its immediate neighbours.",
                "If this agent 6 Note that this may be calculated from N = nab 00 +nab 01 +nab 10 +nab 11. subsequently passes it on, it does so as unidentifiable aggregated information within its shared information.",
                "Thus, an agent may limit the number of agents with which it is willing to reveal identifiable contract outcomes, and yet these contract outcomes can still propagate within the network, and thus, improve estimates of other agents.",
                "Next, we demonstrate empirically that these properties can indeed be realised in practise. 6.2 Empirical Comparison In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this procedure we simulated random networks consisting of ten agents.",
                "Each agent has some direct experience of interacting with a supplier (as described in section 4.3).",
                "At each iteration of the simulation, it interacts with its immediate neighbours and exchanges reputation reports through the sufficient statistics of their Dirichlet distributions.",
                "We compare our solution to two of the most obvious decentralised alternatives: • Private and Shared Information: The agents follow the procedure described in the previous section.",
                "That is, they maintain separate private and shared vectors of contract outcomes, and at each iteration they communicate both these vectors to their immediate neighbours. • Rumour Propagation: The agents do not differentiate between private and shared contract outcomes.",
                "At the first iteration they communicate all of the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In subsequent iterations, they propagate contract outcomes that they receive from any of the neighbours, to all their other immediate neighbours. • Private Information Only: The agents only communicate the contract outcomes that constitute their direct experience.",
                "In all cases, at each iteration, the agents use the Dirichlet distribution in order to calculate their trust estimates.",
                "We compare these three decentralised approaches to a centralised reputation system: • Centralised Reputation: All the agents pass their direct experience to a centralised reputation system that aggregates them together, and passes this estimate back to each agent.",
                "This centralised solution makes the most effective use of information available in the network.",
                "However, most real world problems demand decentralised solutions due to scalability, modularity and communication concerns.",
                "Thus, this centralised solution is included since it represents the optimal case, and allows us to benchmark our decentralised solution.",
                "The results of these comparisons are shown in figure 4.",
                "Here we show the sum of the information content of each agents covariance matrix (calculated as discussed earlier in section 4.3), for each of these four different approaches.",
                "We first note that where private information only is communicated, there is no change in information after the first iteration.",
                "Once each agent has received the direct experience of its immediate neighbours, no further increase in information can be achieved.",
                "This represents the minimum communication, and it exhibits the lowest total information of the four cases.",
                "Next, we note that in the case of rumour propagation, the information content increases continually, and rapidly exceeds the centralised reputation result.",
                "The fact that the rumour propagation case incorrectly exceeds this limit, indicates that it is continuously counting the same contract outcomes as they cycle around the network, in the belief that they are independent events.",
                "Finally, we note that using private and shared information represents a compromise between the private information only case and the centralised reputation case.",

                "We note that the rumour propagation case is clearly inconsistent with the centralised reputation system, since its standard deviation is too small and does not reflect the true uncertainty in the expected utility, given the contract outcomes.",
