While search-based advertising is dominant, the association of ads with a Web page (during user navigation) is becoming increasingly important. In this work, we study the problem of associating ads with a Web page, referred to as content-targeted advertising, from a computer science perspective. We assume that we have access to the text of the Web page, the keywords declared by an advertiser, and a text associated with the advertisers business. Using no other information and operating in fully automatic fashion, we propose ten strategies for solving the problem and evaluate their effectiveness. Our methods indicate that a matching strategy that takes into account the semantics of the problem (referred to as AAK for ads and keywords) can yield gains in average precision figures of 60% compared to a trivial vector-based strategy. Further, a more sophisticated impedance coupling strategy, which expands the text of the Web page to reduce vocabulary impedance with regard to an advertisement, can yield extra gains in average precision of 50%. These are first results. They suggest that great accuracy in content-targeted advertising can be attained with appropriate algorithms.

INTRODUCTION The emergence of the Internet has opened up new marketing opportunities. In fact, a company has now the possibility of showing its advertisements (ads) to millions of people at a low cost. During the 90s, many companies invested heavily on advertising in the Internet with apparently no concerns about their investment return [16]. This situation radically changed in the following decade when the failure of many Web companies led to a dropping in supply of cheap venture capital and a considerable reduction in on-line advertising investments [15,16]. It was clear then that more effective strategies for on-line advertising were required. For that, it was necessary to take into account short-term and long-term interests of the users related to their information needs [9,14]. As a consequence, many companies intensified the adoption of intrusive techniques for gathering information of users mostly without their consent [8]. This raised privacy issues which stimulated the research for less invasive measures [16]. More recently, Internet information gatekeepers as, for example, search engines, recommender systems, and comparison shopping services, have employed what is called paid placement strategies [3]. In such methods, an advertiser company is given prominent positioning in advertisement lists in return for a placement fee. Amongst these methods, the most popular one is a non-intrusive technique called keyword targeted marketing [16]. In this technique, keywords extracted from the users search query are matched against keywords associated with ads provided by advertisers. A ranking of the ads, which also takes into consideration the amount that each advertiser is willing to pay, is computed. The top ranked ads are displayed in the search result page together with the answers for the user query. The success of keyword targeted marketing has motivated information gatekeepers to offer their advertisement services in different contexts. For example, as shown in Figure 1, relevant ads could be shown to users directly in the pages of information portals. The motivation is to take advantage of 496 the users immediate information interests at browsing time. The problem of matching ads to a Web page that is browsed, which we also refer to as content-targeted advertising [1], is different from that of keyword marketing. In this case, instead of dealing with users keywords, we have to use the contents of a Web page to decide which ads to display. Figure 1: Example of content-based advertising in the page of a newspaper. The middle slice of the page shows the beginning of an article about the launch of a DVD movie. At the bottom slice, we can see advertisements picked for this page by Googles content-based advertising system, AdSense. It is important to notice that paid placement advertising strategies imply some risks to information gatekeepers. For instance, there is the possibility of a negative impact on their credibility which, at long term, can demise their market share [3]. This makes investments in the quality of ad recommendation systems even more important to minimize the possibility of exhibiting ads unrelated to the users interests. By investing in their ad systems, information gatekeepers are investing in the maintenance of their credibility and in the reinforcement of a positive user attitude towards the advertisers and their ads [14]. Further, that can translate into higher clickthrough rates that lead to an increase in revenues for information gatekeepers and advertisers, with gains to all parts [3]. In this work, we focus on the problem of content-targeted advertising. We propose new strategies for associating ads with a Web page. Five of these strategies are referred to as matching strategies. They are based on the idea of matching the text of the Web page directly to the text of the ads and its associated keywords. Five other strategies, which we here introduce, are referred to as impedance coupling strategies. They are based on the idea of expanding the Web page with new terms to facilitate the task of matching ads and Web pages. This is motivated by the observation that there is frequently a mismatch between the vocabulary of a Web page and the vocabulary of an advertisement. We say that there is a vocabulary impedance problem and that our technique provides a positive effect of impedance coupling by reducing the vocabulary impedance. Further, all our strategies rely on information that is already available to information gatekeepers that operate keyword targeted advertising systems. Thus, no other data from the advertiser is required. Using a sample of a real case database with over 93,000 ads and 100 Web pages selected for testing, we evaluate our ad recommendation strategies. First, we evaluate the five matching strategies. They match ads to a Web page using a standard vector model and provide what we may call trivial solutions. Our results indicate that a strategy that matches the ad plus its keywords to a Web page, requiring the keywords to appear in the Web page, provides improvements in average precision figures of roughly 60% relative to a strategy that simply matches the ads to the Web page. Such strategy, which we call AAK (for ads and keywords), is then taken as our baseline. Following we evaluate the five impedance coupling strategies. They are based on the idea of expanding the ad and the Web page with new terms to reduce the vocabulary impedance between their texts. Our results indicate that it is possible to generate extra improvements in average precision figures of roughly 50% relative to the AAK strategy. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce five matching strategies to solve content-targeted advertising. In section 3, we present our impedance coupling strategies. In section 4, we describe our experimental methodology and datasets and discuss our results. In section 5 we discuss related work. In section 6 we present our conclusions. 2. MATCHING STRATEGIES Keyword advertising relies on matching search queries to ads and its associated keywords. Context-based advertising, which we address here, relies on matching ads and its associated keywords to the text of a Web page. Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink. To illustrate, for the first ad by Google shown in Figure 1, the title is Star Wars Trilogy Full, the description is Get this popular DVD free. Free w/ free shopping. Sign up now, and the hyperlink points to the site www.freegiftworld.com. Advertisements can be grouped by advertisers in groups called campaigns, such that a campaign can have one or more advertisements. Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai. For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following. In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space. Let wiq be the weight associated with term ti in the query q and wij be the weight associated with term ti in the document dj. Then, q = (w1q, w2q, ..., wiq, ..., wnq) and dj = (w1j, w2j, ..., wij, ..., wnj) are the weighted vectors used to represent the query q and the document dj. These weights can be computed using classic tf-idf schemes. In such schemes, weights are taken as the product between factors that quantify the importance of a term in a document (given by the term frequency, or tf, factor) and its rarity in the whole collection (given by the inverse document factor, or idf, factor), see [2] for details. The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first matching strategy. It is represented by the function AD given by: AD(p, ai) = sim(p, ai) where AD stands for direct match of the ad, composed by title and description and sim(p, ai) is computed according to Eq. (1). In our second method, we use other source of evidence provided by the advertisers: the keywords. With each advertisement ai an advertiser associates a keyword ki, which may be composed of one or more terms. We denote the association between an advertisement ai and a keyword ki as the pair (ai, ki) ∈ K, where K is the set of associations made by the advertisers. In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries. In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords. We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords. For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads. Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy. This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords. Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked. However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results. This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance. As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK. Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3. IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem. First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements. Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page. The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature. That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages. The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements. As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas. Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature. For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic. As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements. To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity. A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page. We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem. In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies. Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance. For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms. Figure 2 illustrates our intuition. We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results. We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path. Our idea is to add new terms (words) to the Web page p to also reduce the vocabulary impedance by providing a second alternative matching path. We refer to our expansion technique as impedance coupling. For this, we proceed as follows. expansion terms keyword vocabulary impedance triggering page p ad Figure 2: Addition of new terms to a Web page to reduce the vocabulary impedance. An advertiser trying to describe a certain topic in a concise way probably will choose general terms to characterize that topic. To facilitate the matching between this ad and our triggering page p, we need to associate new general terms with p. For this, we assume that Web documents similar to the triggering page p share common topics. Therefore, 498 by inspecting the vocabulary of these similar documents we might find good terms for better characterizing the main topics in the page p. We now describe this idea using a Bayesian network model [10,11,13] depicted in Figure 3. R D0 D1 Dj Dk T1 T2 T3 Ti Tm ... ... ... ... Figure 3: Bayesian network model for our impedance coupling technique. In our model, which is based on the belief network in [11], the nodes represent pieces of information in the domain. With each node is associated a binary random variable, which takes the value 1 to mean that the corresponding entity (a page or terms) is observed and, thus, relevant in our computations. In this case, we say that the information was observed. Node R represents the page r, a new representation for the triggering page p. Let N be the set of the k most similar documents to the triggering page, including the triggering page p itself, in a large enough Web collection C. Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj. In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors. Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p. In other words, we are interested in the probability of observing the final evidence regarding a term ti, given that the new representation of the page p has been observed, P(Ti = 1|R = 1). This translates into the following equation1 : P(Ti|R) = 1 P(R) X d P(Ti|d)P(R|d)P(d) (2) where d represents the set of states of the document nodes. Since we are interested just in the states in which only a single document dj is observed and P(d) can be regarded as a constant, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as: P(Ti|R) = ν P(R) kX j=0 P(Ti|dj)P(R|dj) (3) where dj represents the state of the document nodes in which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 1 To simplify our notation we represent the probabilities P(X = 1) as P(X) and P(X = 0) as P(X). associated with P(dj). Eq. (3) is the general equation to compute the probability that a term ti is related to the triggering page. We now define the probabilities P(Ti|dj) and P(R|dj) as follows: P(Ti|dj) = η wij (4) P(R|dj) =  (1 − α) j = 0 α sim(r, dj) 1 ≤ j ≤ k (5) where η is a normalizing constant, wij is the weight associated with term ti in the document dj, and sim(p, dj) is given by Eq. (1), i.e., is the cosine similarity between p and dj. The weight wij is computed using a classic tf-idf scheme and is zero if term ti does not occur in document dj. Notice that P(Ti|dj) = 1 − P(Ti|dj) and P(R|dj) = 1 − P(R|dj). By defining the constant α, it is possible to determine how important should be the influence of the triggering page p to its new representation r. By substituting Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) into Eq. (3), we obtain: P(Ti|R) = ρ ((1 − α) wi0 + α kX j=1 wij sim(r, dj)) (6) where ρ = η ν is a normalizing constant. We use Eq. (6) to determine the set of terms that will compose r, as illustrated in Figure 2. Let ttop be the top ranked term according to Eq. (6). The set r is composed of the terms ti such that P (Ti|R) P (Ttop|R) ≥ β, where β is a given threshold. In our experiments, we have used β = 0.05. Notice that the set r might contain terms that already occur in p. That is, while we will refer to the set r as expansion terms, it should be clear that p ∩ r = ∅. By using α = 0, we simply consider the terms originally in page p. By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r. This is important because, sometimes, a topic apparently not important in the triggering page offers a good opportunity for advertising. For example, consider a triggering page that describes a congress in London about digital photography. Although London is probably not an important topic in this page, advertisements about hotels in London would be appropriate. Thus, adding hotels to page p is important. This suggests using α > 0, that is, preserving the contents of p and using the terms in r to expand p. In this paper, we examine both approaches. Thus, in our sixth method we match r, the set of new expansion terms, directly to the ads, as follows: AAK T(p, ai) = AAK(r, ai) where AAK T stands for match the ad and keywords to the set r of expansion terms. In our seventh method, we match an expanded page p to the ads as follows: AAK EXP(p, ai) = AAK(p ∪ r, ai) where AAK EXP stands for match the ad and keywords to the expanded triggering page. 499 To improve our ad placement methods, other external source that we can use is the content of the page h pointed to by the advertisements hyperlink, that is, its landing page. After all, this page comprises the real target of the ad and perhaps could present a more detailed description of the product or service being advertised. Given that the advertisement ai points to the landing page hi, we denote this association as the pair (ai, hi) ∈ H, where H is the set of associations between the ads and the pages they point to. Our eighth method consists of matching the triggering page p to the landing pages pointed to by the advertisements, as follows: H(p, ai) = sim(p, hi) where (ai, hi) ∈ H and H stands for match the hyperlink pointed to by the ad. We can also combine this information with the more promising methods previously described, AAK and AAK EXP as follows. Given that (ai, hi) ∈ H and (ai, ki) ∈ K, we have our last two methods: AAK H(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ hi ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise AAK EXP H(p, ai) =  sim(p ∪ r, ai ∪ hi ∪ ki) if ki (p ∪ r) 0 if otherwise where AAK H stands for match ads and keywords also considering the page pointed by the ad and AAH EXP H stands for match ads and keywords with expanded triggering page, also considering the page pointed by the ad. Notice that other combinations were not considered in this study due to space restrictions. These other combinations led to poor results in our experimentation and for this reason were discarded. 4. EXPERIMENTS 4.1 Methodology To evaluate our ad placement strategies, we performed a series of experiments using a sample of a real case ad collection with 93,972 advertisements, 1,744 advertisers, and 68,238 keywords2 . The advertisements are grouped in 2,029 campaigns with an average of 1.16 campaigns per advertiser. For the strategies AAK T and AAK EXP, we had to generate a set of expansion terms. For that, we used a database of Web pages crawled by the TodoBR search engine [12] (http://www.todobr.com.br/). This database is composed of 5,939,061 pages of the Brazilian Web, under the domain .br. For the strategies H, AAK H, and AAK EXP H, we also crawled the pages pointed to by the advertisers. No other filtering method was applied to these pages besides the removal of HTML tags. Since we are initially interested in the placement of advertisements in the pages of information portals, our test collection was composed of 100 pages extracted from a Brazilian newspaper. These are our triggering pages. They were crawled in such a way that only the contents of their articles was preserved. As we have no preferences for particular 2 Data in portuguese provided by an on-line advertisement company that operates in Brazil. topics, the crawled pages cover topics as diverse as politics, economy, sports, and culture. For each of our 100 triggering pages, we selected the top three ranked ads provided by each of our 10 ad placement strategies. Thus, for each triggering page we select no more than 30 ads. These top ads were then inserted in a pool for that triggering page. Each pool contained an average of 15.81 advertisements. All advertisements in each pool were submitted to a manual evaluation by a group of 15 users. The average number of relevant advertisements per page pool was 5.15. Notice that we adopted the same pooling method used to evaluate the TREC Web-based collection [6]. To quantify the precision of our results, we used 11-point average figures [2]. Since we are not able to evaluate the entire ad collection, recall values are relative to the set of evaluated advertisements. 4.2 Tuning Idf factors We start by analyzing the impact of different idf factors in our advertisement collection. Idf factors are important because they quantify how discriminative is a term in the collection. In our ad collection, idf factors can be computed by taking ads, advertisers or campaigns as documents. To exemplify, consider the computation of ad idf for a term ti that occurs 9 times in a collection of 100 ads. Then, the inverse document frequency of ti is given by: idfi = log 100 9 Hence, we can compute ad, advertiser or campaign idf factors. As we observe in Figure 4, for the AD strategy, the best ranking is obtained by the use of campaign idf, that is, by calculating our idf factor so that it discriminates campaigns. Similar results were obtained for all the other methods. 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 precision recall Campaign idf Advertiser idf Ad idf Figure 4: Precision-recall curves obtained for the AD strategy using ad, advertiser, and campaign idf factors. This reflects the fact that terms might be better discriminators for a business topic than for an specific ad. This effect can be accomplished by calculating the factor relative to idf advertisers or campaigns instead of ads. In fact, campaign idf factors yielded the best results. Thus, they will be used in all the experiments reported from now on. 500 4.3 Results Matching Strategies Figure 5 displays the results for the matching strategies presented in Section 2. As shown, directly matching the contents of the ad to the triggering page (AD strategy) is not so effective. The reason is that the ad contents are very noisy. It may contain messages that do not properly describe the ad topics such as requisitions for user actions (e.g, visit our site) and general sentences that could be applied to any product or service (e.g, we delivery for the whole country). On the other hand, an advertiser provided keyword summarizes well the topic of the ad. As a consequence, the KW strategy is superior to the AD and AD KW strategies. This situation changes when we require the keywords to appear in the target Web page. By filtering out ads whose keywords do not occur in the triggering page, much noise is discarded. This makes ANDKW a better alternative than KW. Further, in this new situation, the contents of the ad becomes useful to rank the most relevant ads making AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) the best among all described methods. For this reason, we adopt AAK as our baseline in the next set of experiments. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 precision recall AAK ANDKW KW AD_KW AD Figure 5: Comparison among our five matching strategies. AAK (ads and keywords) is superior. Table 1 illustrates average precision figures for Figure 5. We also present actual hits per advertisement slot. We call hit an assignment of an ad (to the triggering page) that was considered relevant by the evaluators. We notice that our AAK strategy provides a gain in average precision of 60% relative to the trivial AD strategy. This shows that careful consideration of the evidence related to the problem does pay off. Impedance Coupling Strategies Table 2 shows top ranked terms that occur in a page covering Argentinean wines produced using grapes derived from the Bordeaux region of France. The p column includes the top terms for this page ranked according to our tf-idf weighting scheme. The r column includes the top ranked expansion terms generated according to Eq. (6). Notice that the expansion terms not only emphasize important terms of the target page (by increasing their weights) such as wines and Methods Hits 11-pt average #1 #2 #3 total score gain(%) AD 41 32 13 86 0.104 AD KW 51 28 17 96 0.106 +1.9 KW 46 34 28 108 0.125 +20.2 ANDKW 49 37 35 121 0.153 +47.1 AD ANDKW (AAK) 51 48 39 138 0.168 +61.5 Table 1: Average precision figures, corresponding to Figure 5, for our five matching strategies.

Further, they avoid some uninteresting terms such as obtained and country. Figure 6 illustrates our results when the set r of expansion terms is used. They show that matching the ads to the terms in the set r instead of to the triggering page p (AAK T strategy) leads to a considerable improvement over our baseline, AAK. The gain is even larger when we use the terms in r to expand the triggering page (AAK EXP method). This confirms our hypothesis that the triggering page could have some interesting terms that should not be completely discarded. Finally, we analyze the impact on the ranking of using the contents of pages pointed by the ads. Figure 7 displays our results. It is clear that using only the contents of the pages pointed by the ads (H strategy) yields very poor results. However, combining evidence from the pages pointed by the ads with our baseline yields improved results. Most important, combining our best strategy so far (AAK EXP) with pages pointed by ads (AAK EXP H strategy) leads to superior results. This happens because the two additional sources of evidence, expansion terms and pages pointed by the ads, are distinct and complementary, providing extra and valuable information for matching ads to a Web page. 501 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 precision recall AAK_EXP AAK_T AAK Figure 6: Impact of using a new representation for the triggering page, one that includes expansion terms. 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 precision recall AAK_EXP_H AAK_H AAK H Figure 7: Impact of using the contents of the page pointed by the ad (the hyperlink). Figure 8 and Table 3 summarize all results described in this section. In Figure 8 we show precision-recall curves and in Table 3 we show 11-point average figures. We also present actual hits per advertisement slot and gains in average precision relative to our baseline, AAK. We notice that the highest number of hits in the first slot was generated by the method AAK EXP. However, the method with best overall retrieval performance was AAK EXP H, yielding a gain in average precision figures of roughly 50% over the baseline (AAK). 4.4 Performance Issues In a keyword targeted advertising system, ads are assigned at query time, thus the performance of the system is a very important issue. In content-targeted advertising systems, we can associate ads with a page at publishing (or updating) time. Also, if a new ad comes in we might consider assigning this ad to already published pages in oﬄine mode. That is, we might design the system such that its performance depends fundamentally on the rate that new pages 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 precision recall AAK_EXP_H AAK_EXP AAK_T AAK_H AAK H Figure 8: Comparison among our ad placement strategies.

Further, the data needed by our strategies (page crawling, page expansion, and ad link crawling) can be gathered and processed oﬄine, not affecting the user experience. Thus, from this point of view, the performance is not critical and will not be addressed in this work. 5. RELATED WORK Several works have stressed the importance of relevance in advertising. For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance. Thus, in order to be effective, the authors conclude that advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the time of exposure. The results in [9] enforce this conclusion by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the more effective it is. Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue. For instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online advertisement to a users short-term interests in a non-intrusive way. Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user. It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user. On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page. In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time. In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems. Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay. In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance. The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture. As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising. Instead of dealing with keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse. Finally, the work in [4] focuses on improving search engine results in a TREC collection by means of an automatic query expansion method based on kNN [17]. Such method resembles our expansion approach presented in section 3. Our method is different from that presented by [4]. They expand user queries applied to a document collection with terms extracted from the top k documents returned as answer to the query in the same collection. In our case, we use two collections: an advertisement and a Web collection. We expand triggering pages with terms extracted from the Web collection and then we match these expanded pages to the ads from the advertisement collection. By doing this, we emphasize the main topics of the triggering pages, increasing the possibility of associating relevant ads with them. 6. CONCLUSIONS In this work we investigated ten distinct strategies for associating ads with a Web page that is browsed (contenttargeted advertising). Five of our strategies attempt to match the ads directly to the Web page. Because of that, they are called matching strategies. The other five strategies recognize that there is a vocabulary impedance problem among ads and Web pages and attempt to solve the problem by expanding the Web pages and the ads with new terms. Because of that they are called impedance coupling strategies. Using a sample of a real case database with over 93 thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies. For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%. This was obtained by a strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies. For our five impedance coupling strategies, the results indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the AAK strategy) are possible. These were generated by expanding the Web page with new terms (obtained using a sample Web collection containing over five million pages) and the ads with the contents of the page they point to (a hyperlink provided by the advertisers). These are first time results that indicate that high quality content-targeted advertising is feasible and practical. 7.

Si bien la publicidad basada en la búsqueda es dominante, la asociación de anuncios con una página web (durante la navegación del usuario) se está volviendo cada vez más importante. En este trabajo, estudiamos el problema de asociar anuncios con una página web, denominada publicidad dirigida a contenido, desde una perspectiva de informática. Suponemos que tenemos acceso al texto de la página web, las palabras clave declaradas por un anunciante y un texto asociado con el negocio de los anunciantes. Usando ninguna otra información y operando de manera totalmente automática, proponemos diez estrategias para resolver el problema y evaluar su efectividad. Nuestros métodos indican que una estrategia de correspondencia que tiene en cuenta la semántica del problema (denominada AAK para ADS y palabras clave) puede generar ganancias en cifras promedio de precisión del 60% en comparación con una estrategia basada en vectores triviales. Además, una estrategia de acoplamiento de impedancia más sofisticada, que expande el texto de la página web para reducir la impedancia de vocabulario con respecto a un anuncio, puede generar ganancias adicionales en una precisión promedio del 50%. Estos son los primeros resultados. Sugieren que se puede lograr una gran precisión en la publicidad dirigida al contenido con algoritmos apropiados.

Introducción La aparición de Internet ha abierto nuevas oportunidades de marketing. De hecho, una empresa ahora tiene la posibilidad de mostrar sus anuncios (anuncios) a millones de personas a un bajo costo. Durante los años 90, muchas compañías invirtieron en gran medida en publicidad en Internet, aparentemente no hay preocupaciones sobre su rendimiento de inversión [16]. Esta situación cambió radicalmente en la siguiente década cuando el fracaso de muchas compañías web condujo a una caída en el suministro de capital de riesgo barato y una reducción considerable en las inversiones publicitarias en línea [15,16]. Estaba claro entonces que se requerían estrategias más efectivas para la publicidad en línea. Para eso, era necesario tener en cuenta los intereses a corto y largo plazo de los usuarios relacionados con sus necesidades de información [9,14]. Como consecuencia, muchas compañías intensificaron la adopción de técnicas intrusivas para recopilar información de los usuarios principalmente sin su consentimiento [8]. Esto planteó problemas de privacidad que estimularon la investigación para medidas menos invasivas [16]. Más recientemente, los guardianes de información de Internet, por ejemplo, los motores de búsqueda, los sistemas de recomendación y los servicios de compras de comparación, han empleado lo que se llama estrategias de colocación pagada [3]. En tales métodos, una empresa anunciante recibe posicionamiento destacado en listas de publicidad a cambio de una tarifa de colocación. Entre estos métodos, el más popular es una técnica no intrusiva llamada Marketing de palabras clave dirigidas [16]. En esta técnica, las palabras clave extraídas de la consulta de búsqueda de usuarios se combinan con palabras clave asociadas con anuncios proporcionados por los anunciantes. Se calcula una clasificación de los anuncios, que también tiene en cuenta la cantidad que cada anunciante está dispuesto a pagar. Los anuncios mejor clasificados se muestran en la página de resultados de búsqueda junto con las respuestas para la consulta del usuario. El éxito del marketing de palabras clave ha motivado a los guardianes de información para que ofrezcan sus servicios de publicidad en diferentes contextos. Por ejemplo, como se muestra en la Figura 1, los anuncios relevantes podrían mostrarse a los usuarios directamente en las páginas de los portales de información. La motivación es aprovechar 496 los usuarios intereses de información inmediata en el momento de la navegación. El problema de hacer coincidir los anuncios con una página web que se navega, que también referimos como publicidad dirigida al contenido [1], es diferente de la del marketing de palabras clave. En este caso, en lugar de tratar con palabras clave de los usuarios, tenemos que usar el contenido de una página web para decidir qué anuncios mostrar. Figura 1: Ejemplo de publicidad basada en contenido en la página de un periódico. La porción media de la página muestra el comienzo de un artículo sobre el lanzamiento de una película de DVD. En la parte inferior, podemos ver anuncios elegidos para esta página por el sistema de publicidad basado en contenido de Googles, Adsense. Es importante notar que las estrategias de publicidad de colocación pagada implican algunos riesgos para los guardianes de la información. Por ejemplo, existe la posibilidad de un impacto negativo en su credibilidad que, a largo plazo, puede desaparecer su participación de mercado [3]. Esto hace que las inversiones en la calidad de los sistemas de recomendación de anuncios sean aún más importantes para minimizar la posibilidad de exhibir anuncios no relacionados con los intereses de los usuarios. Al invertir en sus sistemas publicitarios, los guardianes de información están invirtiendo en el mantenimiento de su credibilidad y en el refuerzo de una actitud positiva del usuario hacia los anunciantes y sus anuncios [14]. Además, eso puede traducirse en tasas de clics más altas que conducen a un aumento en los ingresos para los guardianes de información y los anunciantes, con ganancias a todas las partes [3]. En este trabajo, nos centramos en el problema de la publicidad dirigida al contenido. Proponemos nuevas estrategias para asociar anuncios con una página web. Cinco de estas estrategias se denominan estrategias de correspondencia. Se basan en la idea de hacer coincidir el texto de la página web directamente con el texto de los anuncios y sus palabras clave asociadas. Otras cinco estrategias, que presentamos aquí, se denominan estrategias de acoplamiento de impedancia. Se basan en la idea de expandir la página web con nuevos términos para facilitar la tarea de hacer coincidir anuncios y páginas web. Esto está motivado por la observación de que con frecuencia hay un desajuste entre el vocabulario de una página web y el vocabulario de un anuncio. Decimos que existe un problema de impedancia de vocabulario y que nuestra técnica proporciona un efecto positivo del acoplamiento de impedancia al reducir la impedancia del vocabulario. Además, todas nuestras estrategias dependen de la información que ya está disponible para los guardianes de información que operan sistemas publicitarios de palabras clave. Por lo tanto, no se requieren otros datos del anunciante. Utilizando una muestra de una base de datos de casos real con más de 93,000 anuncios y 100 páginas web seleccionadas para las pruebas, evaluamos nuestras estrategias de recomendación de anuncios. Primero, evaluamos las cinco estrategias de correspondencia. Hagan coincidir los anuncios con una página web utilizando un modelo vectorial estándar y proporcionan lo que podemos llamar soluciones triviales. Nuestros resultados indican que una estrategia que coincide con el anuncio más sus palabras clave a una página web, que requiere que las palabras clave aparezcan en la página web, proporciona mejoras en cifras de precisión promedio de aproximadamente un 60% en relación con una estrategia que simplemente coincide con los anuncios con la web.página. Dicha estrategia, que llamamos AAK (para anuncios y palabras clave), se toma como nuestra línea de base. A continuación, evaluamos las cinco estrategias de acoplamiento de impedancia. Se basan en la idea de expandir el anuncio y la página web con nuevos términos para reducir la impedancia de vocabulario entre sus textos. Nuestros resultados indican que es posible generar mejoras adicionales en las cifras de precisión promedio de aproximadamente el 50% en relación con la estrategia AAK. El papel está organizado de la siguiente manera. En la Sección 2, presentamos cinco estrategias coincidentes para resolver la publicidad dirigida a contenido. En la Sección 3, presentamos nuestras estrategias de acoplamiento de impedancia. En la Sección 4, describimos nuestra metodología y conjuntos de datos experimentales y discutimos nuestros resultados. En la Sección 5 discutimos el trabajo relacionado. En la Sección 6 presentamos nuestras conclusiones.2. Estrategias de coincidencia La publicidad de palabras clave se basa en consultas de búsqueda coincidentes con los anuncios y sus palabras clave asociadas. La publicidad basada en el contexto, que abordamos aquí, se basa en los anuncios coincidentes y sus palabras clave asociadas al texto de una página web. Dada una determinada página web P, que llamamos página de activación, nuestra tarea es seleccionar anuncios relacionados con el contenido de la p.Sin pérdida de generalidad, consideramos que una AI publicitaria está compuesta por un título, una descripción textual y un hipervínculo. Para ilustrar, para el primer anuncio de Google que se muestra en la Figura 1, el título es Star Wars Trilogy Full, la descripción es obtener este popular DVD gratis. GRATIS con compras gratis. Regístrese ahora, y el hipervínculo apunta al sitio www.freegiftworld.com. Los anunciantes pueden agrupar anuncios en grupos llamados campañas, de modo que una campaña puede tener uno o más anuncios. Dado nuestra página P y un conjunto A de anuncios, una forma simple de clasificar ai ∈ A con respecto a P es coincidir el contenido de P con el contenido de la IA. Para esto, utilizamos el modelo de espacio vectorial [2], como se discutió en el siguiente. En el modelo de espacio vectorial, las consultas y los documentos se representan como vectores ponderados en un espacio n-dimensional. Deje que WIQ sea el peso asociado con el término Ti en la consulta Q y Wij el peso asociado con el término Ti en el documento DJ. Entonces, q = (w1q, w2q, ..., wiq, ..., wnq) y dj = (w1j, w2j, ..., wij, ..., wnj) son los vectores ponderados utilizados para representar la consultaP y el documento DJ. Estos pesos se pueden calcular utilizando esquemas clásicos de TF-IDF. En tales esquemas, los pesos se toman como el producto entre los factores que cuantifican la importancia de un término en un documento (dado por el término frecuencia, o tf, factor) y su rareza en toda la colección (dada por el factor de documento inverso, oIDF, factor), ver [2] para más detalles. La clasificación de la consulta q con respecto al documento DJ se calcula por la fórmula Cosine Simility 497, es decir, el coseno del ángulo entre los dos vectores correspondientes: SIM (Q, DJ) = Q • DJ | Q |× | DJ |= Pn i = 1 wiq · wij qpn i = 1 w2 iq qpn i = 1 w2 ij (1) considerando p como consulta y ai como documento, podemos clasificar los anuncios con respecto a la página web p.Esta es nuestra primera estrategia de correspondencia. Está representado por la función AD dada por: AD (P, AI) = SIM (P, AI) donde el anuncio representa la coincidencia directa del anuncio, compuesto por el título y la descripción y SIM (P, AI) se calcula de acuerdo con la ecuación.(1). En nuestro segundo método, utilizamos otra fuente de evidencia proporcionada por los anunciantes: las palabras clave. Con cada anuncio, un anunciante asocia una palabra clave KI, que puede estar compuesta por uno o más términos. Denotamos la asociación entre una IA publicitaria y una palabra clave KI como el par (ai, ki) ∈ K, donde k es el conjunto de asociaciones hechas por los anunciantes. En el caso de la publicidad dirigida por palabras clave, tales palabras clave se utilizan para que coincidan con los anuncios con las consultas de los usuarios. Aquí, los usamos para que coincidan con los anuncios con la página web p.Esto proporciona nuestro segundo método para la coincidencia de anuncios dado por: KW (P, Ai) = Sim (P, Ki) donde (AI, Ki) ∈ K y KW significa que coincidan con las palabras clave de AD. Notamos que la mayoría de las palabras clave seleccionadas por los anunciantes también están presentes en los anuncios asociados con esas palabras clave. Por ejemplo, en nuestra colección de pruebas de publicidad, esto es cierto para el 90% de los anuncios. Por lo tanto, en lugar de usar las palabras clave como dispositivos coincidentes, podemos usarlas para enfatizar los conceptos principales en un anuncio, en un intento por mejorar nuestra estrategia de anuncios. Esto lleva a nuestro tercer método de coincidencia de anuncios dado por: AD KW (P, Ai) = SIM (P, Ai ∪ Ki) donde (Ai, Ki) ∈ K y AD KW significa coincidir con el AD y sus palabras clave. Finalmente, es importante notar que la palabra clave KI asociada con AI no podría aparecer en absoluto en la página P desencadenante, incluso cuando la IA está altamente clasificada. Sin embargo, si suponemos que KI resume el tema principal de la IA según un punto de vista del anunciante, puede ser interesante asegurar su presencia en la pág.Este razonamiento sugiere que requerir la ocurrencia de la palabra clave KI en la página de activación P como una condición para asociar la IA con P podría conducir a mejores resultados. Esto conduce a dos estrategias de correspondencia adicionales de la siguiente manera: andkw (p, ai) =  sim (p, ai) si ki p 0 si de lo contrario ad andkw (p, ai) = aak (p, ai) =  sim (p,ai ∪ ki) Si ki p 0 si de lo contrario (ai, ki) ∈ K, ykw significa coincidir con las palabras clave de anuncios y forzar su apariencia, y AD ykw (o AAK para anuncios y palabras clave) significa coincidir con las palabras clave, sus palabras clavey forzar su apariencia. Como veremos en nuestros resultados, lo mejor entre estos métodos simples es AAK. Por lo tanto, se utilizará como línea de base para nuestras estrategias de acoplamiento de impedancia que ahora discutimos.3. Estrategias de acoplamiento de impedancia Dos temas clave se aclaran a medida que se juega con el problema publicitario de contenido. Primero, la página de activación normalmente pertenece a un alcance contextual más amplio que el de los anuncios. En segundo lugar, la asociación entre un buen anuncio y la página de activación podría depender de un tema que no se menciona explícitamente en la página de activación. El primer problema se debe al hecho de que las páginas web pueden ser sobre cualquier tema y que los anuncios son de naturaleza concisa. Es decir, los anuncios tienden a estar más restringidos que las páginas web. El segundo problema está relacionado con el hecho de que, como luego discutimos, la mayoría de los anunciantes colocan un pequeño número de anuncios. Como resultado, tenemos pocos términos que describen sus áreas de interés. En consecuencia, estos términos tienden a ser de naturaleza más general. Por ejemplo, una tienda de automóviles probablemente preferiría usar automóvil en lugar de Super Sport para describir su tema comercial principal. Como consecuencia, muchos términos específicos que aparecen en la página de activación no encuentran coincidencia en los anuncios. Para empeorar las cosas, una página puede referirse a una entidad o sujeto del mundo a través de una etiqueta que es distinta de la etiqueta seleccionada por un anunciante para referirse a la misma entidad. Una consecuencia de estos dos problemas es que los vocabularios de las páginas y los anuncios tienen una intersección baja, incluso cuando un anuncio está relacionado con una página. A partir de ahora citamos este problema como el problema de la impedancia del vocabulario. En nuestros experimentos, nos dimos cuenta de que este problema limita la calidad final de las estrategias de correspondencia directa. Por lo tanto, estudiamos alternativas para reducir la impedancia de vocabulario referida. Para esto, proponemos expandir las páginas de activación con nuevos términos. La Figura 2 ilustra nuestra intuición. Ya sabemos que la adición de palabras clave (seleccionadas por el anunciante) a los anuncios conduce a mejores resultados. Decimos que una palabra clave reduce la impedancia del vocabulario al proporcionar una ruta de coincidencia alternativa. Nuestra idea es agregar nuevos términos (palabras) a la página web P para reducir también la impedancia de vocabulario al proporcionar una segunda ruta de coincidencia alternativa. Nos referimos a nuestra técnica de expansión como acoplamiento de impedancia. Para esto, procedemos de la siguiente manera.Términos de expansión Vocabulario Key Vocabulary Disparación Página P AD Figura 2: Adición de nuevos términos a una página web para reducir la impedancia de vocabulario. Un anunciante que intenta describir un determinado tema de manera concisa probablemente elegirá términos generales para caracterizar ese tema. Para facilitar la coincidencia entre este anuncio y nuestra página de activación P, necesitamos asociar nuevos términos generales con p.Para esto, suponemos que los documentos web similares a la página de activación P comparten temas comunes. Por lo tanto, 498 al inspeccionar el vocabulario de estos documentos similares, podríamos encontrar buenos términos para caracterizar mejor los temas principales en la página p.Ahora describimos esta idea utilizando un modelo de red bayesiano [10,11,13] representado en la Figura 3. R d0 d1 dj dk t1 t2 t3 ti tm ... ... ... ... Figura 3: Modelo de red bayesiana para nuestra técnica de acoplamiento de impedancia. En nuestro modelo, que se basa en la red de creencias en [11], los nodos representan información en el dominio. Con cada nodo se asocia una variable aleatoria binaria, que toma el valor 1 para significar que la entidad correspondiente (una página o términos) se observa y, por lo tanto, es relevante en nuestros cálculos. En este caso, decimos que se observó la información. El nodo R representa la página R, una nueva representación para la página de activación p.Sea n el conjunto de K documentos más similares a la página de activación, incluida la página de activación P en sí, en una colección web lo suficientemente grande C. Los nodos raíz D0 a DK representan los documentos en n, es decir, la página de activación D0 ysus k vecinos más cercanos, D1 a DK, entre todas las páginas en C. Hay una ventaja desde el nodo DJ al nodo R Si el documento DJ está en N. Los nodos T1 a TM representan los términos en el vocabulario de C. Hay una ventaja deNodo DJ a un nodo Ti si el término Ti ocurre en el documento DJ. En nuestro modelo, la observación de las páginas en N conduce a la observación de una nueva representación de la página P desencadenante y a un conjunto de términos que describen los principales temas asociados con P y sus vecinos. Dadas estas definiciones, ahora podemos usar la red para determinar la probabilidad de que un término TI sea un buen término para representar un tema de la página de activación p.En otras palabras, estamos interesados en la probabilidad de observar la evidencia final con respecto a un término TI, dado que se ha observado la nueva representación de la página P, P (Ti = 1 | R = 1). Esto se traduce en la siguiente ecuación1: P (ti | r) = 1 p (r) x d p (ti | d) p (r | d) p (d) (2) donde d representa el conjunto de estados del documentonodos. Dado que estamos interesados solo en los estados en los que solo se observa un solo documento DJ y P (d) puede considerarse como una constante, podemos reescribir la ecuación.(2) AS: P (Ti | R) = ν P (R) KX J = 0 P (TI | DJ) P (R | DJ) (3) donde DJ representa el estado de los nodos de documento en el que solo documenta DJse observa y ν es una constante 1 Para simplificar nuestra notación, representamos las probabilidades P (x = 1) como p (x) y p (x = 0) como p (x).asociado con P (DJ). Ec.(3) es la ecuación general para calcular la probabilidad de que un término Ti esté relacionado con la página de activación. Ahora definimos las probabilidades P (ti | dj) y p (r | dj) como sigue: p (ti | dj) = η wij (4) p (r | dj) =  (1 - α) j = 0 αSim (R, DJ) 1 ≤ J ≤ K (5) donde η es una constante de normalización, WIJ es el peso asociado con el término Ti en el documento DJ, y Sim (P, DJ) está dado por la ecuación.(1), es decir, es la similitud cosena entre P y DJ. El peso WIJ se calcula utilizando un esquema clásico TF-IDF y es cero si el término Ti no ocurre en el documento DJ. Observe que p (ti | dj) = 1 - p (ti | dj) y p (r | dj) = 1 - p (r | dj). Al definir la α constante, es posible determinar cuán importante debe ser la influencia de la página P de activación a su nueva representación r.Sustituyendo la ecuación.(4) y la ecuación.(5) En la ecuación.(3), obtenemos: p (ti | r) = ρ ((1 - α) wi0 + α kx j = 1 wij sim (r, dj)) (6) donde ρ = η ν es una constante de normalización. Usamos la ecuación.(6) para determinar el conjunto de términos que componerán R, como se ilustra en la Figura 2. Deje que TTOP sea el término mejor clasificado según la ecuación.(6). El conjunto R está compuesto por los términos Ti de tal manera que P (Ti | R) P (TTOP | R) ≥ β, donde β es un umbral dado. En nuestros experimentos, hemos usado β = 0.05. Observe que el conjunto R podría contener términos que ya ocurren en p.Es decir, si bien nos referiremos al conjunto R como términos de expansión, debe estar claro que p ∩ r = ∅. Al usar α = 0, simplemente consideramos los términos originalmente en la página p.Al aumentar el α, relajamos el contexto de la página P, agregando términos de las páginas vecinas, convirtiendo la página P en su nueva representación r.Esto es importante porque, a veces, un tema aparentemente no importante en la página desencadenante ofrece una buena oportunidad para la publicidad. Por ejemplo, considere una página desencadenante que describe un Congreso en Londres sobre la fotografía digital. Aunque Londres probablemente no sea un tema importante en esta página, los anuncios sobre hoteles en Londres serían apropiados. Por lo tanto, agregar hoteles a la página P es importante. Esto sugiere usar α> 0, es decir, preservar el contenido de P y usar los términos en R para expandir p.En este documento, examinamos ambos enfoques. Por lo tanto, en nuestro sexto método coincidimos con R, el conjunto de nuevos términos de expansión, directamente a los anuncios, como sigue: Aak T (P, Ai) = Aak (R, Ai) donde Aak T significa que coincida con el anuncio y las palabras clave con las palabras clave conEl conjunto R de términos de expansión. En nuestro séptimo método, coincidimos con una página P ampliada con los anuncios de la siguiente manera: Aak Exp (P, Ai) = Aak (P ∪ R, AI) donde AAK Exp significa coincidir con el anuncio y las palabras clave con la página de activación expandida.499 Para mejorar nuestros métodos de colocación de anuncios, otra fuente externa que podemos usar es el contenido de la página H señalado por los anuncios Hyperlink, es decir, su página de destino. Después de todo, esta página comprende el objetivo real del anuncio y tal vez podría presentar una descripción más detallada del producto o servicio que se anuncia. Dado que el anuncio AI apunta a la página de destino HI, denotamos esta asociación como el par (ai, hi) ∈ H, donde h es el conjunto de asociaciones entre los anuncios y las páginas a las que señalan. Nuestro octavo método consiste en hacer coincidir la página de activación P con las páginas de destino que se apuntan por los anuncios, como sigue: h (p, ai) = sim (p, hi) donde (ai, hi) ∈ H y h representa coincidir con elHyperlink señalado por el anuncio. También podemos combinar esta información con los métodos más prometedores descritos anteriormente, Aak y Aak Exp de la siguiente manera. Dado que (ai, hi) ∈ H y (ai, ki) ∈ K, tenemos nuestros dos últimos métodos: aak h (p, ai) =  sim (p, ai ∪ hi ∪ ki) si ki p 0 si no es lo contrarioAak exp h (p, ai) =  sim (p ∪ r, ai ∪ hi ∪ ki) si ki (p ∪ r) 0 si es lo contrario donde aak h representa anuncios de coincidencia y palabras clave también considerando la página apuntada por el anuncio yAAH Exp H significa anuncios de coincidencia y palabras clave con una página de activación expandida, también considerando la página señalada por el anuncio. Observe que otras combinaciones no se consideraron en este estudio debido a restricciones de espacio. Estas otras combinaciones condujeron a malos resultados en nuestra experimentación y por esta razón fueron descartadas.4. Experimentos 4.1 Metodología Para evaluar nuestras estrategias de colocación de anuncios, realizamos una serie de experimentos utilizando una muestra de una colección de anuncios de casos reales con 93,972 anuncios, 1,744 anunciantes y 68,238 palabras clave2. Los anuncios se agrupan en 2.029 campañas con un promedio de 1.16 campañas por anunciante. Para las estrategias Aak T y Aak Exp, tuvimos que generar un conjunto de términos de expansión. Para eso, utilizamos una base de datos de páginas web arrastradas por el motor de búsqueda de ToDobr [12] (http://www.todobr.com.br/). Esta base de datos está compuesta por 5,939,061 páginas de la web brasileña, bajo el dominio .br. Para las estrategias H, Aak H y Aak Exp H, también arrastramos las páginas señaladas por los anunciantes. No se aplicó otro método de filtrado a estas páginas además de la eliminación de etiquetas HTML. Dado que inicialmente estamos interesados en la colocación de anuncios en las páginas de los portales de información, nuestra colección de pruebas estaba compuesta por 100 páginas extraídas de un periódico brasileño. Estas son nuestras páginas desencadenantes. Se arrastraban de tal manera que solo se conservaba el contenido de sus artículos. Como no tenemos preferencias para 2 datos particulares en portugués proporcionados por una compañía publicitaria en línea que opera en Brasil.Temas, las páginas rastreadas cubren temas tan diversos como la política, la economía, los deportes y la cultura. Para cada una de nuestras 100 páginas de activación, seleccionamos los tres anuncios clasificados principales proporcionados por cada una de nuestras 10 estrategias de colocación de anuncios. Por lo tanto, para cada página de activación no seleccionamos más de 30 anuncios. Estos anuncios superiores se insertaron en una piscina para esa página de activación. Cada grupo contenía un promedio de 15.81 anuncios. Todos los 15 usuarios enviaron todos los anuncios en cada grupo a una evaluación manual de 15 usuarios. El número promedio de anuncios relevantes por grupo de páginas fue de 5.15. Observe que adoptamos el mismo método de agrupación utilizado para evaluar la colección basada en la web de TREC [6]. Para cuantificar la precisión de nuestros resultados, utilizamos cifras promedio de 11 puntos [2]. Dado que no podemos evaluar toda la colección de anuncios, los valores de recuperación son relativos al conjunto de anuncios evaluados.4.2 Ajuste de factores IDF Comenzamos analizando el impacto de diferentes factores de IDF en nuestra colección de publicidad. Los factores de las FDI son importantes porque cuantifican cómo discriminativo es un término en la recolección. En nuestra colección de anuncios, los factores de las FDI se pueden calcular tomando anuncios, anunciantes o campañas como documentos. Para ejemplificar, considere el cálculo de AD IDF para un término TI que ocurre 9 veces en una colección de 100 anuncios. Luego, la frecuencia de documento inverso de Ti viene dada por: IDFI = log 100 9 Por lo tanto, podemos calcular factores AD, Anunciantes o IDF de la Campaña. Como observamos en la Figura 4, para la estrategia publicitaria, la mejor clasificación se obtiene mediante el uso de las IDF de la campaña, es decir, calculando nuestro factor IDF para que discrimine las campañas. Se obtuvieron resultados similares para todos los demás métodos.0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Precisión Campaña de recuerdo IDF Anunciante de IDF AD IDF Figura 4: Curvas de recuperación de precisión obtenidas para la estrategia AD utilizando factores AD, Anunciantes y IDF de la Campaña. Esto refleja el hecho de que los términos podrían ser mejores discriminadores para un tema comercial que para un anuncio específico. Este efecto se puede lograr calculando el factor en relación con los anunciantes o campañas de las FDI en lugar de los anuncios. De hecho, los factores de IDF de la campaña arrojaron los mejores resultados. Por lo tanto, se utilizarán en todos los experimentos informados a partir de ahora.500 4.3 Resultados Estrategias de coincidencia La Figura 5 muestra los resultados para las estrategias de coincidencia presentadas en la Sección 2. Como se muestra, coincidir directamente con el contenido del anuncio con la página de activación (estrategia de anuncios) no es tan efectivo. La razón es que el contenido de anuncios es muy ruidoso. Puede contener mensajes que no describan adecuadamente los temas de anuncios, como solicitudes para acciones del usuario (por ejemplo, visitar nuestro sitio) y oraciones generales que podrían aplicarse a cualquier producto o servicio (por ejemplo, entregamos a todo el país). Por otro lado, un anunciante proporcionó una palabra clave resume bien el tema del anuncio. Como consecuencia, la estrategia KW es superior a las estrategias AD y AD KW. Esta situación cambia cuando requerimos que las palabras clave aparezcan en la página web de destino. Al filtrar anuncios cuyas palabras clave no ocurren en la página de activación, se descarta mucho ruido. Esto hace que Andkw sea una mejor alternativa que KW. Además, en esta nueva situación, el contenido del anuncio se vuelve útil para clasificar los anuncios más relevantes que hacen que AD andkw (o AAK para anuncios y palabras clave) sea el mejor entre todos los métodos descritos. Por esta razón, adoptamos AAK como nuestra línea de base en el siguiente conjunto de experimentos.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recuerdo de precisión Aak ykw KW AD_KW AD Figura 5: Comparación entre nuestras cinco estrategias de coincidencia.

Llamamos a la tarea de una tarea de un anuncio (a la página de activación) que los evaluadores consideran relevantes. Notamos que nuestra estrategia AAK proporciona una ganancia en una precisión promedio del 60% en relación con la estrategia de publicidad trivial. Esto muestra que la consideración cuidadosa de la evidencia relacionada con el problema vale la pena. Estrategias de acoplamiento de impedancia La Tabla 2 muestra términos mejor clasificados que ocurren en una página que cubre vinos argentinos producidos con uvas derivadas de la región de Burdeos de Francia. La columna P incluye los términos principales para esta página clasificados de acuerdo con nuestro esquema de ponderación TF-IDF. La columna R incluye los términos de expansión mejorados generados según la ecuación.(6).

Tabla 2: Términos de clasificación superior para la página de activación P de acuerdo con nuestro esquema de peso TF -IDF y mejor clasificadoTérminos para R, los términos de expansión para P, generados de acuerdo con la ecuación.(6). Los puntajes de clasificación se normalizaron para resumir hasta 1. Los términos marcados con * no son compartidos por los conjuntos P y R.Blancos, pero también revelan nuevos términos relacionados con el tema principal de la página, como Aroma y Red. Además, evitan algunos términos poco interesantes como obtenido y país. La Figura 6 ilustra nuestros resultados cuando se usa el conjunto R de términos de expansión. Muestran que coincidir los anuncios con los términos en el conjunto R en lugar de con la página de activación P (Estrategia Aak T) conduce a una mejora considerable sobre nuestra línea de base, AAK. La ganancia es aún mayor cuando usamos los términos en R para expandir la página de activación (método Aak Exp). Esto confirma nuestra hipótesis de que la página desencadenante podría tener algunos términos interesantes que no deberían descartarse por completo. Finalmente, analizamos el impacto en la clasificación del uso del contenido de las páginas señaladas por los anuncios. La Figura 7 muestra nuestros resultados. Está claro que el uso solo del contenido de las páginas señaladas por los anuncios (estrategia H) produce resultados muy pobres. Sin embargo, la combinación de evidencia de las páginas señaladas por los anuncios con nuestras bases produce resultados mejorados. Lo más importante, la combinación de nuestra mejor estrategia hasta ahora (Aak Exp) con páginas señaladas por ADS (Estrategia Aak Exp H) conduce a resultados superiores. Esto sucede porque las dos fuentes adicionales de evidencia, términos de expansión y páginas señaladas por los anuncios, son distintas y complementarias, proporcionando información adicional y valiosa para unir anuncios con una página web.501 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recuerdo de precisión AAK_EXP AAK_T AAK Figura 6: Impacto del uso de una nueva representación para la página desencadenante, una que incluye términos de expansión.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Recuerda de precisión AAK_EXP_H AAK_H AAK H Figura 7: Impacto del uso del contenido de la página señalado por el AD (el Hyperlink).

También presentamos éxitos reales por ranura publicitaria y ganancias en promedio de precisión en relación con nuestra línea de base, AAK. Notamos que el mayor número de golpes en la primera ranura fue generado por el método Aak Exp. Sin embargo, el método con el mejor rendimiento de recuperación general fue Aak Exp H, produciendo una ganancia en cifras promedio de precisión de aproximadamente 50% sobre la línea de base (AAK).4.4 Problemas de rendimiento En un sistema de publicidad de palabras clave, los anuncios se asignan en el momento de la consulta, por lo que el rendimiento del sistema es un tema muy importante. En los sistemas publicitarios dirigidos a contenido, podemos asociar anuncios con una página en la publicación (o actualización). Además, si entra un nuevo anuncio, podríamos considerar asignar este anuncio a páginas ya publicadas en el modo O ﬄ ine. Es decir, podríamos diseñar el sistema de manera que su rendimiento dependa fundamentalmente de la velocidad en que las nuevas páginas 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Precisión Recuerda AAK_EXP_H AAK_EXP AAK_T AAK_H AAK H Figura 8: Comparación entre nuestro ADEstrategias de colocación.

Además, los datos necesarios por nuestras estrategias (rastreo de páginas, expansión de la página y rastreo de enlaces de anuncios) se pueden recopilar y procesar sobre la experiencia del usuario. Por lo tanto, desde este punto de vista, el rendimiento no es crítico y no se abordará en este trabajo.5. Trabajo relacionado Varios trabajos han enfatizado la importancia de la relevancia en la publicidad. Por ejemplo, en [14] se demostró que los anuncios que se presentan a los usuarios cuando no están interesados en ellos se ven igual de molestias. Por lo tanto, para ser efectivos, los autores concluyen que los anuncios deben ser relevantes para las preocupaciones de los consumidores en el momento de la exposición. Los resultados en [9] hacen cumplir esta conclusión señalando que cuanto más dirigida es la publicidad, más efectiva es. Por lo tanto, no es sorprendente que otros trabajos hayan abordado el problema de relevancia. Por ejemplo, en [8] se propone un sistema llamado ADWIZ que puede adaptar el anuncio en línea a los intereses de los usuarios a corto plazo de una manera no intrusiva. Al contrario de nuestro trabajo, ADWIZ no usa directamente el contenido de la página vista por el usuario. Se basa en las palabras clave de búsqueda suministradas por el usuario a los motores de búsqueda y en la URL de la página solicitada por el usuario. Por otro lado, en [7] los autores presentaron un enfoque intrusivo en el que un agente se encuentra entre los anunciantes y el navegador de usuarios que permite colocar un banner en la página vista actualmente. A pesar de tener la oportunidad de usar el contenido de las páginas, 502 el agente infiere la relevancia basada en la información de la categoría y la información privada de los usuarios recopilada a lo largo del tiempo. En [5], los autores proporcionan una comparación entre las estrategias de clasificación utilizadas por Google y la Obertura para sus sistemas de publicidad de palabras clave. Ambos sistemas seleccionan anuncios al igualarlos con las palabras clave proporcionadas por el usuario en una consulta de búsqueda y clasificar la lista de anuncios resultante de acuerdo con la voluntad de los anunciantes para pagar. En particular, el enfoque de Google también considera la tasa de clics de cada anuncio como una evidencia adicional de su relevancia. Los autores concluyen que la estrategia de Googles es mejor que la utilizada por la obertura. Como se mencionó anteriormente, el problema de clasificación en la publicidad de palabras clave es diferente del de la publicidad dirigida al contenido. En lugar de tratar con palabras clave proporcionadas por los usuarios en consultas de búsqueda, tenemos que lidiar con el contenido de una página que puede ser muy difuso. Finalmente, el trabajo en [4] se centra en mejorar los resultados del motor de búsqueda en una colección TREC mediante un método de expansión de consulta automática basado en KNN [17]. Tal método se asemeja a nuestro enfoque de expansión presentado en la Sección 3. Nuestro método es diferente del presentado por [4]. Expanden las consultas de los usuarios aplicadas a una recopilación de documentos con términos extraídos de los principales documentos K devueltos como respuesta a la consulta en la misma colección. En nuestro caso, utilizamos dos colecciones: un anuncio y una colección web. Ampliamos las páginas de activación con los términos extraídos de la colección web y luego combinamos estas páginas ampliadas con los anuncios de la colección de anuncios. Al hacer esto, enfatizamos los principales temas de las páginas desencadenantes, aumentando la posibilidad de asociar anuncios relevantes con ellos.6. Conclusiones En este trabajo investigamos diez estrategias distintas para asociar anuncios con una página web que está navegada (publicidad con atribuido contenido). Cinco de nuestras estrategias intentan igualar los anuncios directamente con la página web. Debido a eso, se llaman estrategias coincidentes. Las otras cinco estrategias reconocen que existe un problema de impedancia de vocabulario entre anuncios y páginas web e intentan resolver el problema expandiendo las páginas web y los anuncios con nuevos términos. Debido a eso, se llaman estrategias de acoplamiento de impedancia. Utilizando una muestra de una base de datos de casos real con más de 93 mil anuncios, evaluamos nuestras estrategias. Para las cinco estrategias de correspondencia, nuestros resultados indicaron que la consideración planificada de evidencia adicional (como las palabras clave proporcionadas por los anunciantes) arrojaron ganancias en cifras promedio de precisión (para nuestra recolección de pruebas) del 60%. Esto se obtuvo mediante una estrategia llamada AAK (para anuncios y palabras clave), que se toma como la línea de base para evaluar nuestras estrategias de acoplamiento de impedancia más avanzadas. Para nuestras cinco estrategias de acoplamiento de impedancia, los resultados indican que son posibles ganancias adicionales en una precisión promedio del 50% (ahora en relación con la estrategia AAK). Estos se generaron expandiendo la página web con nuevos términos (obtenidos utilizando una colección web de muestra que contiene más de cinco millones de páginas) y los anuncios con el contenido de la página a la que apuntan (un hipervínculo proporcionado por los anunciantes). Estos son resultados por primera vez que indican que la publicidad dirigida a contenido de alta calidad es factible y práctica.7.

        "In fact, a company has now the possibility of showing its advertisements (ads) to millions of people at a low cost.",
        "During the 90s, many companies invested heavily on advertising in the Internet with apparently no concerns about their investment return [16].",
        "This situation radically changed in the following decade when the failure of many Web companies led to a dropping in supply of cheap venture capital and a considerable reduction in on-line advertising investments [15,16].",
        "It was clear then that more effective strategies for on-line advertising were required.",
        "For that, it was necessary to take into account short-term and long-term interests of the users related to their information needs [9,14].",
        "As a consequence, many companies intensified the adoption of intrusive techniques for gathering information of users mostly without their consent [8].",
        "This raised privacy issues which stimulated the research for less invasive measures [16].",
        "More recently, Internet information gatekeepers as, for example, search engines, recommender systems, and comparison shopping services, have employed what is called paid placement strategies [3].",
        "In such methods, an advertiser company is given prominent positioning in advertisement lists in return for a placement fee.",
        "Amongst these methods, the most popular one is a non-intrusive technique called keyword targeted marketing [16].",
        "In this technique, keywords extracted from the users search query are matched against keywords associated with ads provided by advertisers.",
        "A ranking of the ads, which also takes into consideration the amount that each advertiser is willing to pay, is computed.",
        "The top ranked ads are displayed in the search result page together with the answers for the user query.",
        "The success of keyword targeted marketing has motivated information gatekeepers to offer their advertisement services in different contexts.",
        "For example, as shown in Figure 1, relevant ads could be shown to users directly in the pages of information portals.",
        "The motivation is to take advantage of 496 the users immediate information interests at browsing time.",
        "The problem of matching ads to a Web page that is browsed, which we also refer to as content-targeted advertising [1], is different from that of keyword marketing.",
        "In this case, instead of dealing with users keywords, we have to use the contents of a Web page to decide which ads to display.",
        "Figure 1: Example of content-based advertising in the page of a newspaper.",
        "The middle slice of the page shows the beginning of an article about the launch of a DVD movie.",
        "At the bottom slice, we can see advertisements picked for this page by Googles content-based advertising system, AdSense.",
        "It is important to notice that paid placement advertising strategies imply some risks to information gatekeepers.",
        "For instance, there is the possibility of a negative impact on their credibility which, at long term, can demise their market share [3].",
        "This makes investments in the quality of ad recommendation systems even more important to minimize the possibility of exhibiting ads unrelated to the users interests.",
        "By investing in their ad systems, information gatekeepers are investing in the maintenance of their credibility and in the reinforcement of a positive user attitude towards the advertisers and their ads [14].",
        "Further, that can translate into higher clickthrough rates that lead to an increase in revenues for information gatekeepers and advertisers, with gains to all parts [3].",
        "In this work, we focus on the problem of content-targeted advertising.",
        "We propose new strategies for associating ads with a Web page.",
        "Five of these strategies are referred to as matching strategies.",
        "They are based on the idea of matching the text of the Web page directly to the text of the ads and its associated keywords.",
        "Five other strategies, which we here introduce, are referred to as impedance coupling strategies.",
        "They are based on the idea of expanding the Web page with new terms to facilitate the task of matching ads and Web pages.",
        "This is motivated by the observation that there is frequently a mismatch between the vocabulary of a Web page and the vocabulary of an advertisement.",
        "We say that there is a vocabulary impedance problem and that our technique provides a positive effect of impedance coupling by reducing the vocabulary impedance.",
        "Further, all our strategies rely on information that is already available to information gatekeepers that operate keyword targeted advertising systems.",
        "Thus, no other data from the advertiser is required.",
        "Using a sample of a real case database with over 93,000 ads and 100 Web pages selected for testing, we evaluate our ad recommendation strategies.",
        "First, we evaluate the five matching strategies.",
        "They match ads to a Web page using a standard vector model and provide what we may call trivial solutions.",
        "Our results indicate that a strategy that matches the ad plus its keywords to a Web page, requiring the keywords to appear in the Web page, provides improvements in average precision figures of roughly 60% relative to a strategy that simply matches the ads to the Web page.",
        "Such strategy, which we call AAK (for ads and keywords), is then taken as our baseline.",
        "Following we evaluate the five impedance coupling strategies.",
        "They are based on the idea of expanding the ad and the Web page with new terms to reduce the vocabulary impedance between their texts.",
        "Our results indicate that it is possible to generate extra improvements in average precision figures of roughly 50% relative to the AAK strategy.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, we introduce five matching strategies to solve content-targeted advertising.",
        "In section 3, we present our impedance coupling strategies.",
        "In section 4, we describe our experimental methodology and datasets and discuss our results.",

        "MATCHING STRATEGIES Keyword advertising relies on matching search queries to ads and its associated keywords.",
        "Context-based advertising, which we address here, relies on matching ads and its associated keywords to the text of a Web page.",
        "Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",
        "To illustrate, for the first ad by Google shown in Figure 1, the title is Star Wars Trilogy Full, the description is Get this popular DVD free.",

        "Advertisements can be grouped by advertisers in groups called campaigns, such that a campaign can have one or more advertisements.",
        "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
        "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
        "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",
        "Let wiq be the weight associated with term ti in the query q and wij be the weight associated with term ti in the document dj.",
        "Then, q = (w1q, w2q, ..., wiq, ..., wnq) and dj = (w1j, w2j, ..., wij, ..., wnj) are the weighted vectors used to represent the query q and the document dj.",
        "These weights can be computed using classic tf-idf schemes.",
        "In such schemes, weights are taken as the product between factors that quantify the importance of a term in a document (given by the term frequency, or tf, factor) and its rarity in the whole collection (given by the inverse document factor, or idf, factor), see [2] for details.",
        "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first matching strategy.",
        "It is represented by the function AD given by: AD(p, ai) = sim(p, ai) where AD stands for direct match of the ad, composed by title and description and sim(p, ai) is computed according to Eq. (1).",
        "In our second method, we use other source of evidence provided by the advertisers: the keywords.",
        "With each advertisement ai an advertiser associates a keyword ki, which may be composed of one or more terms.",
        "We denote the association between an advertisement ai and a keyword ki as the pair (ai, ki) ∈ K, where K is the set of associations made by the advertisers.",
        "In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
        "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
        "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
        "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
        "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
        "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
        "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
        "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
        "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
        "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",
        "Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3.",
        "IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem.",
        "First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements.",
        "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
        "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
        "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
        "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
        "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
        "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
        "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
        "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
        "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
        "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
        "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
        "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",
        "Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance.",
        "For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates our intuition.",
        "We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results.",
        "We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path.",
        "Our idea is to add new terms (words) to the Web page p to also reduce the vocabulary impedance by providing a second alternative matching path.",
        "We refer to our expansion technique as impedance coupling.",
        "For this, we proceed as follows. expansion terms keyword vocabulary impedance triggering page p ad Figure 2: Addition of new terms to a Web page to reduce the vocabulary impedance.",
        "An advertiser trying to describe a certain topic in a concise way probably will choose general terms to characterize that topic.",
        "To facilitate the matching between this ad and our triggering page p, we need to associate new general terms with p. For this, we assume that Web documents similar to the triggering page p share common topics.",
        "Therefore, 498 by inspecting the vocabulary of these similar documents we might find good terms for better characterizing the main topics in the page p. We now describe this idea using a Bayesian network model [10,11,13] depicted in Figure 3.",
        "R D0 D1 Dj Dk T1 T2 T3 Ti Tm ... ... ... ...",
        "Figure 3: Bayesian network model for our impedance coupling technique.",
        "In our model, which is based on the belief network in [11], the nodes represent pieces of information in the domain.",
        "With each node is associated a binary random variable, which takes the value 1 to mean that the corresponding entity (a page or terms) is observed and, thus, relevant in our computations.",
        "In this case, we say that the information was observed.",
        "Node R represents the page r, a new representation for the triggering page p. Let N be the set of the k most similar documents to the triggering page, including the triggering page p itself, in a large enough Web collection C. Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",
        "In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.",
        "Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p. In other words, we are interested in the probability of observing the final evidence regarding a term ti, given that the new representation of the page p has been observed, P(Ti = 1|R = 1).",
        "This translates into the following equation1 : P(Ti|R) = 1 P(R) X d P(Ti|d)P(R|d)P(d) (2) where d represents the set of states of the document nodes.",
        "Since we are interested just in the states in which only a single document dj is observed and P(d) can be regarded as a constant, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as: P(Ti|R) = ν P(R) kX j=0 P(Ti|dj)P(R|dj) (3) where dj represents the state of the document nodes in which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 1 To simplify our notation we represent the probabilities P(X = 1) as P(X) and P(X = 0) as P(X). associated with P(dj).",
        "Eq. (3) is the general equation to compute the probability that a term ti is related to the triggering page.",
        "We now define the probabilities P(Ti|dj) and P(R|dj) as follows: P(Ti|dj) = η wij (4) P(R|dj) =  (1 − α) j = 0 α sim(r, dj) 1 ≤ j ≤ k (5) where η is a normalizing constant, wij is the weight associated with term ti in the document dj, and sim(p, dj) is given by Eq. (1), i.e., is the cosine similarity between p and dj.",
        "The weight wij is computed using a classic tf-idf scheme and is zero if term ti does not occur in document dj.",
        "Notice that P(Ti|dj) = 1 − P(Ti|dj) and P(R|dj) = 1 − P(R|dj).",
        "By defining the constant α, it is possible to determine how important should be the influence of the triggering page p to its new representation r. By substituting Eq. (4) and Eq. (5) into Eq. (3), we obtain: P(Ti|R) = ρ ((1 − α) wi0 + α kX j=1 wij sim(r, dj)) (6) where ρ = η ν is a normalizing constant.",
        "We use Eq. (6) to determine the set of terms that will compose r, as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "Let ttop be the top ranked term according to Eq. (6).",
        "The set r is composed of the terms ti such that P (Ti|R) P (Ttop|R) ≥ β, where β is a given threshold.",
        "In our experiments, we have used β = 0.05.",
        "Notice that the set r might contain terms that already occur in p. That is, while we will refer to the set r as expansion terms, it should be clear that p ∩ r = ∅.",
        "By using α = 0, we simply consider the terms originally in page p. By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r. This is important because, sometimes, a topic apparently not important in the triggering page offers a good opportunity for advertising.",
        "For example, consider a triggering page that describes a congress in London about digital photography.",
        "Although London is probably not an important topic in this page, advertisements about hotels in London would be appropriate.",
        "Thus, adding hotels to page p is important.",
        "This suggests using α > 0, that is, preserving the contents of p and using the terms in r to expand p. In this paper, we examine both approaches.",
        "Thus, in our sixth method we match r, the set of new expansion terms, directly to the ads, as follows: AAK T(p, ai) = AAK(r, ai) where AAK T stands for match the ad and keywords to the set r of expansion terms.",
        "In our seventh method, we match an expanded page p to the ads as follows: AAK EXP(p, ai) = AAK(p ∪ r, ai) where AAK EXP stands for match the ad and keywords to the expanded triggering page. 499 To improve our ad placement methods, other external source that we can use is the content of the page h pointed to by the advertisements hyperlink, that is, its landing page.",
        "After all, this page comprises the real target of the ad and perhaps could present a more detailed description of the product or service being advertised.",
        "Given that the advertisement ai points to the landing page hi, we denote this association as the pair (ai, hi) ∈ H, where H is the set of associations between the ads and the pages they point to.",
        "Our eighth method consists of matching the triggering page p to the landing pages pointed to by the advertisements, as follows: H(p, ai) = sim(p, hi) where (ai, hi) ∈ H and H stands for match the hyperlink pointed to by the ad.",
        "We can also combine this information with the more promising methods previously described, AAK and AAK EXP as follows.",
        "Given that (ai, hi) ∈ H and (ai, ki) ∈ K, we have our last two methods: AAK H(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ hi ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise AAK EXP H(p, ai) =  sim(p ∪ r, ai ∪ hi ∪ ki) if ki (p ∪ r) 0 if otherwise where AAK H stands for match ads and keywords also considering the page pointed by the ad and AAH EXP H stands for match ads and keywords with expanded triggering page, also considering the page pointed by the ad.",
        "Notice that other combinations were not considered in this study due to space restrictions.",
        "These other combinations led to poor results in our experimentation and for this reason were discarded. 4.",
        "EXPERIMENTS 4.1 Methodology To evaluate our ad placement strategies, we performed a series of experiments using a sample of a real case ad collection with 93,972 advertisements, 1,744 advertisers, and 68,238 keywords2 .",

        "For the strategies AAK T and AAK EXP, we had to generate a set of expansion terms.",
        "For that, we used a database of Web pages crawled by the TodoBR search engine [12] (http://www.todobr.com.br/).",
        "This database is composed of 5,939,061 pages of the Brazilian Web, under the domain .br.",
        "For the strategies H, AAK H, and AAK EXP H, we also crawled the pages pointed to by the advertisers.",
        "No other filtering method was applied to these pages besides the removal of HTML tags.",
        "Since we are initially interested in the placement of advertisements in the pages of information portals, our test collection was composed of 100 pages extracted from a Brazilian newspaper.",

        "As we have no preferences for particular 2 Data in portuguese provided by an on-line advertisement company that operates in Brazil. topics, the crawled pages cover topics as diverse as politics, economy, sports, and culture.",
        "For each of our 100 triggering pages, we selected the top three ranked ads provided by each of our 10 ad placement strategies.",
        "Thus, for each triggering page we select no more than 30 ads.",
        "These top ads were then inserted in a pool for that triggering page.",
        "Each pool contained an average of 15.81 advertisements.",
        "All advertisements in each pool were submitted to a manual evaluation by a group of 15 users.",
        "The average number of relevant advertisements per page pool was 5.15.",
        "Notice that we adopted the same pooling method used to evaluate the TREC Web-based collection [6].",
        "To quantify the precision of our results, we used 11-point average figures [2].",
        "Since we are not able to evaluate the entire ad collection, recall values are relative to the set of evaluated advertisements. 4.2 Tuning Idf factors We start by analyzing the impact of different idf factors in our advertisement collection.",
        "Idf factors are important because they quantify how discriminative is a term in the collection.",
        "In our ad collection, idf factors can be computed by taking ads, advertisers or campaigns as documents.",
        "To exemplify, consider the computation of ad idf for a term ti that occurs 9 times in a collection of 100 ads.",
        "Then, the inverse document frequency of ti is given by: idfi = log 100 9 Hence, we can compute ad, advertiser or campaign idf factors.",
        "As we observe in Figure 4, for the AD strategy, the best ranking is obtained by the use of campaign idf, that is, by calculating our idf factor so that it discriminates campaigns.",

        "This reflects the fact that terms might be better discriminators for a business topic than for an specific ad.",
        "This effect can be accomplished by calculating the factor relative to idf advertisers or campaigns instead of ads.",
        "In fact, campaign idf factors yielded the best results.",

        "As shown, directly matching the contents of the ad to the triggering page (AD strategy) is not so effective.",
        "The reason is that the ad contents are very noisy.",
        "It may contain messages that do not properly describe the ad topics such as requisitions for user actions (e.g, visit our site) and general sentences that could be applied to any product or service (e.g, we delivery for the whole country).",
        "On the other hand, an advertiser provided keyword summarizes well the topic of the ad.",
        "As a consequence, the KW strategy is superior to the AD and AD KW strategies.",
        "This situation changes when we require the keywords to appear in the target Web page.",
        "By filtering out ads whose keywords do not occur in the triggering page, much noise is discarded.",
        "This makes ANDKW a better alternative than KW.",

        "RELATED WORK Several works have stressed the importance of relevance in advertising.",
        "For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",
        "Thus, in order to be effective, the authors conclude that advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the time of exposure.",
        "The results in [9] enforce this conclusion by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the more effective it is.",
        "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",
        "For instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online advertisement to a users short-term interests in a non-intrusive way.",
        "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
        "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
        "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
        "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",
        "In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems.",
        "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
        "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
        "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",
        "As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising.",

        "Because of that, they are called matching strategies.",
        "The other five strategies recognize that there is a vocabulary impedance problem among ads and Web pages and attempt to solve the problem by expanding the Web pages and the ads with new terms.",
        "Because of that they are called impedance coupling strategies.",
        "Using a sample of a real case database with over 93 thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies.",
        "For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.",
        "This was obtained by a strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.",
        "For our five impedance coupling strategies, the results indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the AAK strategy) are possible.",
        "These were generated by expanding the Web page with new terms (obtained using a sample Web collection containing over five million pages) and the ads with the contents of the page they point to (a hyperlink provided by the advertisers).",
        "These are first time results that indicate that high quality content-targeted advertising is feasible and practical. 7.",

                "Context-based advertising, which we address here, relies on matching ads and its associated keywords to the text of a Web page.",
                "Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",
                "To illustrate, for the first ad by Google shown in Figure 1, the title is Star Wars Trilogy Full, the description is Get this popular DVD free.",

                "Advertisements can be grouped by advertisers in groups called campaigns, such that a campaign can have one or more advertisements.",
                "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",
                "Let wiq be the weight associated with term ti in the query q and wij be the weight associated with term ti in the document dj.",
                "Then, q = (w1q, w2q, ..., wiq, ..., wnq) and dj = (w1j, w2j, ..., wij, ..., wnj) are the weighted vectors used to represent the query q and the document dj.",
                "These weights can be computed using classic tf-idf schemes.",
                "In such schemes, weights are taken as the product between factors that quantify the importance of a term in a document (given by the term frequency, or tf, factor) and its rarity in the whole collection (given by the inverse document factor, or idf, factor), see [2] for details.",
                "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first matching strategy.",
                "It is represented by the function AD given by: AD(p, ai) = sim(p, ai) where AD stands for direct match of the ad, composed by title and description and sim(p, ai) is computed according to Eq. (1).",
                "In our second method, we use other source of evidence provided by the advertisers: the keywords.",
                "With each advertisement ai an advertiser associates a keyword ki, which may be composed of one or more terms.",
                "We denote the association between an advertisement ai and a keyword ki as the pair (ai, ki) ∈ K, where K is the set of associations made by the advertisers.",
                "In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
                "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",
                "Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3.",
                "IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem.",
                "First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements.",
                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
                "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",
                "Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance.",
                "For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates our intuition.",
                "We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results.",
                "We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path.",
                "Our idea is to add new terms (words) to the Web page p to also reduce the vocabulary impedance by providing a second alternative matching path.",
                "We refer to our expansion technique as impedance coupling.",
                "For this, we proceed as follows. expansion terms keyword vocabulary impedance triggering page p ad Figure 2: Addition of new terms to a Web page to reduce the vocabulary impedance.",
                "An advertiser trying to describe a certain topic in a concise way probably will choose general terms to characterize that topic.",
                "To facilitate the matching between this ad and our triggering page p, we need to associate new general terms with p. For this, we assume that Web documents similar to the triggering page p share common topics.",
                "Therefore, 498 by inspecting the vocabulary of these similar documents we might find good terms for better characterizing the main topics in the page p. We now describe this idea using a Bayesian network model [10,11,13] depicted in Figure 3.",

                "In our model, which is based on the belief network in [11], the nodes represent pieces of information in the domain.",
                "With each node is associated a binary random variable, which takes the value 1 to mean that the corresponding entity (a page or terms) is observed and, thus, relevant in our computations.",
                "In this case, we say that the information was observed.",
                "Node R represents the page r, a new representation for the triggering page p. Let N be the set of the k most similar documents to the triggering page, including the triggering page p itself, in a large enough Web collection C. Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",
                "In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.",
                "Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p. In other words, we are interested in the probability of observing the final evidence regarding a term ti, given that the new representation of the page p has been observed, P(Ti = 1|R = 1).",

                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",

                "Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",
                "To illustrate, for the first ad by Google shown in Figure 1, the title is Star Wars Trilogy Full, the description is Get this popular DVD free.",

                "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",
                "Let wiq be the weight associated with term ti in the query q and wij be the weight associated with term ti in the document dj.",
                "Then, q = (w1q, w2q, ..., wiq, ..., wnq) and dj = (w1j, w2j, ..., wij, ..., wnj) are the weighted vectors used to represent the query q and the document dj.",

                "In such schemes, weights are taken as the product between factors that quantify the importance of a term in a document (given by the term frequency, or tf, factor) and its rarity in the whole collection (given by the inverse document factor, or idf, factor), see [2] for details.",
                "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first matching strategy.",
                "It is represented by the function AD given by: AD(p, ai) = sim(p, ai) where AD stands for direct match of the ad, composed by title and description and sim(p, ai) is computed according to Eq. (1).",
                "In our second method, we use other source of evidence provided by the advertisers: the keywords.",
                "With each advertisement ai an advertiser associates a keyword ki, which may be composed of one or more terms.",
                "We denote the association between an advertisement ai and a keyword ki as the pair (ai, ki) ∈ K, where K is the set of associations made by the advertisers.",
                "In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
                "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",
                "Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3.",
                "IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem.",
                "First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements.",
                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
                "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",
                "Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance.",
                "For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates our intuition.",
                "We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results.",
                "We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path.",
                "Our idea is to add new terms (words) to the Web page p to also reduce the vocabulary impedance by providing a second alternative matching path.",

                "To facilitate the matching between this ad and our triggering page p, we need to associate new general terms with p. For this, we assume that Web documents similar to the triggering page p share common topics.",
                "Therefore, 498 by inspecting the vocabulary of these similar documents we might find good terms for better characterizing the main topics in the page p. We now describe this idea using a Bayesian network model [10,11,13] depicted in Figure 3.",

Let N be the set of the k most similar documents to the triggering page, including the triggering page p itself, in a large enough Web collection C. Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",
                "In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.",
                "Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p.

By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r.

                "For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",

                "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",

                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",

                "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",

                "Context-based advertising, which we address here, relies on matching ads and its associated keywords to the text of a Web page.",
                "Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",
                "To illustrate, for the first ad by Google shown in Figure 1, the title is Star Wars Trilogy Full, the description is Get this popular DVD free.",

                "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",
                "Let wiq be the weight associated with term ti in the query q and wij be the weight associated with term ti in the document dj.",

                "In such schemes, weights are taken as the product between factors that quantify the importance of a term in a document (given by the term frequency, or tf, factor) and its rarity in the whole collection (given by the inverse document factor, or idf, factor), see [2] for details.",
                "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first matching strategy.",
                "It is represented by the function AD given by: AD(p, ai) = sim(p, ai) where AD stands for direct match of the ad, composed by title and description and sim(p, ai) is computed according to Eq. (1).",
                "In our second method, we use other source of evidence provided by the advertisers: the keywords.",
                "With each advertisement ai an advertiser associates a keyword ki, which may be composed of one or more terms.",
                "We denote the association between an advertisement ai and a keyword ki as the pair (ai, ki) ∈ K, where K is the set of associations made by the advertisers.",
                "In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
                "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",
                "Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3.",
                "IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem.",
                "First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements.",
                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
                "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",
                "Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance.",
                "For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates our intuition.",
                "We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results.",
                "We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path.",
                "Our idea is to add new terms (words) to the Web page p to also reduce the vocabulary impedance by providing a second alternative matching path.",

Let N be the set of the k most similar documents to the triggering page, including the triggering page p itself, in a large enough Web collection C. Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",
                "In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.",
                "Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p. In other words, we are interested in the probability of observing the final evidence regarding a term ti, given that the new representation of the page p has been observed, P(Ti = 1|R = 1).",
                "This translates into the following equation1 : P(Ti|R) = 1 P(R) X d P(Ti|d)P(R|d)P(d) (2) where d represents the set of states of the document nodes.",
                "Since we are interested just in the states in which only a single document dj is observed and P(d) can be regarded as a constant, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as: P(Ti|R) = ν P(R) kX j=0 P(Ti|dj)P(R|dj) (3) where dj represents the state of the document nodes in which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 1 To simplify our notation we represent the probabilities P(X = 1) as P(X) and P(X = 0) as P(X). associated with P(dj).",

(1), i.e., is the cosine similarity between p and dj.",

                "By using α = 0, we simply consider the terms originally in page p. By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r. This is important because, sometimes, a topic apparently not important in the triggering page offers a good opportunity for advertising.",

                "For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",

                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",
                "In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems.",
                "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",
                "As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of <br>content-targeted advertising</br>.",

                "Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",

                "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",

                "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first matching strategy.",
                "It is represented by the function AD given by: AD(p, ai) = sim(p, ai) where AD stands for direct match of the ad, composed by title and description and sim(p, ai) is computed according to Eq. (1).",
                "In our second method, we use other source of evidence provided by the advertisers: the keywords.",
                "With each advertisement ai an advertiser associates a keyword ki, which may be composed of one or more terms.",
                "We denote the association between an advertisement ai and a keyword ki as the pair (ai, ki) ∈ K, where K is the set of associations made by the advertisers.",
                "In the case of <br>keyword targeted advertising</br>, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
                "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",
                "Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3.",
                "IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem.",
                "First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements.",
                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
                "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",
                "Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance.",
                "For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates our intuition.",
                "We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results.",
                "We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path.",
                "Our idea is to add new terms (words) to the Web page p to also reduce the vocabulary impedance by providing a second alternative matching path.",

                "To facilitate the matching between this ad and our triggering page p, we need to associate new general terms with p. For this, we assume that Web documents similar to the triggering page p share common topics.",
                "Therefore, 498 by inspecting the vocabulary of these similar documents we might find good terms for better characterizing the main topics in the page p. We now describe this idea using a Bayesian network model [10,11,13] depicted in Figure 3.",

Let N be the set of the k most similar documents to the triggering page, including the triggering page p itself, in a large enough Web collection C. Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",
                "In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.",
                "Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p.

                "Since we are interested just in the states in which only a single document dj is observed and P(d) can be regarded as a constant, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as: P(Ti|R) = ν P(R) kX j=0 P(Ti|dj)P(R|dj) (3) where dj represents the state of the document nodes in which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 1 To simplify our notation we represent the probabilities P(X = 1) as P(X) and P(X = 0) as P(X). associated with P(dj).",

By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r.

                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",

                "Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",

                "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",

                "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first <br>matching strategy</br>.",

                "We denote the association between an advertisement ai and a keyword ki as the pair (ai, ki) ∈ K, where K is the set of associations made by the advertisers.",
                "In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
                "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",
                "Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3.",
                "IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem.",
                "First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements.",
                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
                "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",
                "Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance.",
                "For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates our intuition.",
                "We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results.",
                "We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path.",
                "Our idea is to add new terms (words) to the Web page p to also reduce the vocabulary impedance by providing a second alternative matching path.",

Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",
                "In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.",
                "Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p.

                "This translates into the following equation1 : P(Ti|R) = 1 P(R) X d P(Ti|d)P(R|d)P(d) (2) where d represents the set of states of the document nodes.",
                "Since we are interested just in the states in which only a single document dj is observed and P(d) can be regarded as a constant, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as: P(Ti|R) = ν P(R) kX j=0 P(Ti|dj)P(R|dj) (3) where dj represents the state of the document nodes in which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 1 To simplify our notation we represent the probabilities P(X = 1) as P(X) and P(X = 0) as P(X). associated with P(dj).",

                "By using α = 0, we simply consider the terms originally in page p. By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r. This is important because, sometimes, a topic apparently not important in the triggering page offers a good opportunity for advertising.",

                "For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",
                "Thus, in order to be effective, the authors conclude that advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the time of exposure.",
                "The results in [9] enforce this conclusion by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the more effective it is.",
                "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",
                "For instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online advertisement to a users short-term interests in a non-intrusive way.",
                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",
                "In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems.",
                "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",
                "As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising.",
                "Instead of dealing with keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse.",
                "Finally, the work in [4] focuses on improving search engine results in a TREC collection by means of an automatic query expansion method based on kNN [17].",

                "Five of our strategies attempt to match the ads directly to the Web page.",
                "Because of that, they are called matching strategies.",

                "Because of that they are called impedance coupling strategies.",
                "Using a sample of a real case database with over 93 thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies.",
                "For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.",
                "This was obtained by a strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.",
                "For our five impedance coupling strategies, the results indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the AAK strategy) are possible.",

                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",

This is our first matching strategy.",

                "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",

                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
                "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",

Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",

                "This translates into the following equation1 : P(Ti|R) = 1 P(R) X d P(Ti|d)P(R|d)P(d) (2) where d represents the set of states of the document nodes.",
                "Since we are interested just in the states in which only a single document dj is observed and P(d) can be regarded as a constant, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as: P(Ti|R) = ν P(R) kX j=0 P(Ti|dj)P(R|dj) (3) where dj represents the state of the document nodes in which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 1 To simplify our notation we represent the probabilities P(X = 1) as P(X) and P(X = 0) as P(X). associated with P(dj).",

                "By using α = 0, we simply consider the terms originally in page p. By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r. This is important because, sometimes, a topic apparently not important in the triggering page offers a good opportunity for advertising.",
                "For example, consider a triggering page that describes a congress in London about digital photography.",

                "RELATED WORK Several works have stressed the importance of relevance in advertising.",
                "For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",
                "Thus, in order to be effective, the authors conclude that advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the time of exposure.",
                "The results in [9] enforce this conclusion by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the more effective it is.",
                "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",
                "For instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online advertisement to a users short-term interests in a non-intrusive way.",
                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",
                "In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems.",
                "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",
                "As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising.",
                "Instead of dealing with keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse.",

                "Five of our strategies attempt to match the ads directly to the Web page.",
                "Because of that, they are called matching strategies.",

                "Because of that they are called impedance coupling strategies.",
                "Using a sample of a real case database with over 93 thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies.",
                "For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.",
                "This was obtained by a strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.",
                "For our five impedance coupling strategies, the results indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the AAK strategy) are possible.",
                "These were generated by expanding the Web page with new terms (obtained using a sample Web collection containing over five million pages) and the ads with the contents of the page they point to (a hyperlink provided by the advertisers).",

                "Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",

                "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",
                "Let wiq be the weight associated with term ti in the query q and wij be the weight associated with term ti in the document dj.",

                "In such schemes, weights are taken as the product between factors that quantify the importance of a term in a document (given by the term frequency, or tf, factor) and its rarity in the whole collection (given by the inverse document factor, or idf, factor), see [2] for details.",
                "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first matching strategy.",
                "It is represented by the function AD given by: AD(p, ai) = sim(p, ai) where AD stands for direct match of the ad, composed by title and description and sim(p, ai) is computed according to Eq. (1).",

                "With each advertisement ai an advertiser associates a keyword ki, which may be composed of one or more terms.",
                "We denote the association between an advertisement ai and a keyword ki as the pair (ai, ki) ∈ K, where K is the set of associations made by the advertisers.",
                "In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
                "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",
                "Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3.",
                "IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem.",
                "First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements.",
                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
                "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",
                "Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance.",
                "For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates our intuition.",
                "We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results.",
                "We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path.",

Let N be the set of the k most similar documents to the triggering page, including the triggering page p itself, in a large enough Web collection C. Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",
                "In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.",
                "Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p. In other words, we are interested in the probability of observing the final evidence regarding a term ti, given that the new representation of the page p has been observed, P(Ti = 1|R = 1).",
                "This translates into the following equation1 : P(Ti|R) = 1 P(R) X d P(Ti|d)P(R|d)P(d) (2) where d represents the set of states of the document nodes.",
                "Since we are interested just in the states in which only a single document dj is observed and P(d) can be regarded as a constant, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as: P(Ti|R) = ν P(R) kX j=0 P(Ti|dj)P(R|dj) (3) where dj represents the state of the document nodes in which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 1 To simplify our notation we represent the probabilities P(X = 1) as P(X) and P(X = 0) as P(X). associated with P(dj).",
                "Eq. (3) is the general equation to compute the probability that a term ti is related to the triggering page.",
                "We now define the probabilities P(Ti|dj) and P(R|dj) as follows: P(Ti|dj) = η wij (4) P(R|dj) =  (1 − α) j = 0 α sim(r, dj) 1 ≤ j ≤ k (5) where η is a normalizing constant, wij is the weight associated with term ti in the document dj, and sim(p, dj) is given by Eq.

(5) into Eq. (3), we obtain: P(Ti|R) = ρ ((1 − α) wi0 + α kX j=1 wij sim(r, dj)) (6) where ρ = η ν is a normalizing constant.",

                "Notice that the set r might contain terms that already occur in p. That is, while we will refer to the set r as expansion terms, it should be clear that p ∩ r = ∅.",
                "By using α = 0, we simply consider the terms originally in page p. By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r. This is important because, sometimes, a topic apparently not important in the triggering page offers a good opportunity for advertising.",
                "For example, consider a triggering page that describes a congress in London about digital photography.",
                "Although London is probably not an important topic in this page, advertisements about hotels in London would be appropriate.",

                "As shown, directly matching the contents of the ad to the triggering page (AD strategy) is not so effective.",
                "The reason is that the ad contents are very noisy.",
                "It may contain messages that do not properly describe the ad topics such as requisitions for user actions (e.g, visit our site) and general sentences that could be applied to any product or service (e.g, we delivery for the whole country).",
                "On the other hand, an advertiser provided keyword summarizes well the topic of the ad.",
                "As a consequence, the KW strategy is superior to the AD and AD KW strategies.",
                "This situation changes when we require the keywords to appear in the target Web page.",
                "By filtering out ads whose keywords do not occur in the triggering page, much noise is discarded.",
                "This makes ANDKW a better alternative than KW.",
                "Further, in this new situation, the contents of the ad becomes useful to rank the most relevant ads making AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) the best among all described methods.",

                "RELATED WORK Several works have stressed the importance of relevance in advertising.",
                "For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",
                "Thus, in order to be effective, the authors conclude that advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the time of exposure.",
                "The results in [9] enforce this conclusion by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the more effective it is.",
                "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",
                "For instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online advertisement to a users short-term interests in a non-intrusive way.",
                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",
                "In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems.",
                "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",
                "As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising.",
                "Instead of dealing with keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse.",
                "Finally, the work in [4] focuses on improving search engine results in a TREC collection by means of an automatic query expansion method based on kNN [17].",

                "CONCLUSIONS In this work we investigated ten distinct strategies for associating ads with a Web page that is browsed (contenttargeted advertising).",
                "Five of our strategies attempt to match the ads directly to the Web page.",
                "Because of that, they are called matching strategies.",
                "The other five strategies recognize that there is a vocabulary impedance problem among ads and Web pages and attempt to solve the problem by expanding the Web pages and the ads with new terms.",
                "Because of that they are called impedance coupling strategies.",
                "Using a sample of a real case database with over 93 thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies.",
                "For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.",
                "This was obtained by a strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.",
                "For our five impedance coupling strategies, the results indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the AAK strategy) are possible.",
                "These were generated by expanding the Web page with new terms (obtained using a sample Web collection containing over five million pages) and the ads with the contents of the page they point to (a hyperlink provided by the advertisers).",

                "As shown, directly matching the contents of the ad to the triggering page (AD strategy) is not so effective.",

                "It may contain messages that do not properly describe the ad topics such as requisitions for user actions (e.g, visit our site) and general sentences that could be applied to any product or service (e.g, we delivery for the whole country).",
                "On the other hand, an advertiser provided keyword summarizes well the topic of the ad.",
                "As a consequence, the KW strategy is superior to the AD and AD KW strategies.",
                "This situation changes when we require the keywords to appear in the target Web page.",
                "By filtering out ads whose keywords do not occur in the triggering page, much noise is discarded.",

                "RELATED WORK Several works have stressed the importance of relevance in advertising.",
                "For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",
                "Thus, in order to be effective, the authors conclude that advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the time of exposure.",
                "The results in [9] enforce this conclusion by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the more effective it is.",
                "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",
                "For instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online advertisement to a users short-term interests in a non-intrusive way.",
                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",
                "In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems.",
                "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",
                "As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising.",
                "Instead of dealing with keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse.",
                "Finally, the work in [4] focuses on improving search engine results in a TREC collection by means of an automatic query expansion method based on kNN [17].",
                "Such method resembles our expansion approach presented in section 3.",
                "Our method is different from that presented by [4].",

                "CONCLUSIONS In this work we investigated ten distinct strategies for associating ads with a Web page that is browsed (contenttargeted advertising).",
                "Five of our strategies attempt to match the ads directly to the Web page.",
                "Because of that, they are called matching strategies.",
                "The other five strategies recognize that there is a vocabulary impedance problem among ads and Web pages and attempt to solve the problem by expanding the Web pages and the ads with new terms.",
                "Because of that they are called impedance coupling strategies.",
                "Using a sample of a real case database with over 93 thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies.",
                "For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.",
                "This was obtained by a strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.",
                "For our five impedance coupling strategies, the results indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the AAK strategy) are possible.",
                "These were generated by expanding the Web page with new terms (obtained using a sample Web collection containing over five million pages) and the ads with the contents of the page they point to (a hyperlink provided by the advertisers).",

                "Context-based advertising, which we address here, relies on matching ads and its associated keywords to the text of a Web page.",
                "Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",

                "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",

                "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first matching strategy.",
                "It is represented by the function AD given by: AD(p, ai) = sim(p, ai) where AD stands for direct match of the ad, composed by title and description and sim(p, ai) is computed according to Eq. (1).",

                "In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
                "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",
                "Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3.",
                "IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem.",
                "First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements.",
                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
                "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",
                "Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance.",
                "For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates our intuition.",
                "We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results.",
                "We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path.",

Let N be the set of the k most similar documents to the triggering page, including the triggering page p itself, in a large enough Web collection C. Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",
                "In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.",
                "Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p. In other words, we are interested in the probability of observing the final evidence regarding a term ti, given that the new representation of the page p has been observed, P(Ti = 1|R = 1).",
                "This translates into the following equation1 : P(Ti|R) = 1 P(R) X d P(Ti|d)P(R|d)P(d) (2) where d represents the set of states of the document nodes.",
                "Since we are interested just in the states in which only a single document dj is observed and P(d) can be regarded as a constant, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as: P(Ti|R) = ν P(R) kX j=0 P(Ti|dj)P(R|dj) (3) where dj represents the state of the document nodes in which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 1 To simplify our notation we represent the probabilities P(X = 1) as P(X) and P(X = 0) as P(X). associated with P(dj).",

(5) into Eq. (3), we obtain: P(Ti|R) = ρ ((1 − α) wi0 + α kX j=1 wij sim(r, dj)) (6) where ρ = η ν is a normalizing constant.",

                "By using α = 0, we simply consider the terms originally in page p. By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r. This is important because, sometimes, a topic apparently not important in the triggering page offers a good opportunity for advertising.",
                "For example, consider a triggering page that describes a congress in London about digital photography.",
                "Although London is probably not an important topic in this page, advertisements about hotels in London would be appropriate.",

                "RELATED WORK Several works have stressed the importance of relevance in advertising.",
                "For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",
                "Thus, in order to be effective, the authors conclude that advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the time of exposure.",
                "The results in [9] enforce this conclusion by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the more effective it is.",
                "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",
                "For instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online advertisement to a users short-term interests in a non-intrusive way.",
                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",
                "In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems.",
                "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",
                "As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising.",
                "Instead of dealing with keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse.",
                "Finally, the work in [4] focuses on improving search engine results in a TREC collection by means of an automatic query expansion method based on kNN [17].",

                "Five of our strategies attempt to match the ads directly to the Web page.",
                "Because of that, they are called matching strategies.",
                "The other five strategies recognize that there is a vocabulary impedance problem among ads and Web pages and attempt to solve the problem by expanding the Web pages and the ads with new terms.",
                "Because of that they are called impedance coupling strategies.",
                "Using a sample of a real case database with over 93 thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies.",
                "For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.",
                "This was obtained by a strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.",
                "For our five impedance coupling strategies, the results indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the AAK strategy) are possible.",
                "These were generated by expanding the Web page with new terms (obtained using a sample Web collection containing over five million pages) and the ads with the contents of the page they point to (a hyperlink provided by the advertisers).",

                "Context-based advertising, which we address here, relies on matching ads and its associated keywords to the text of a Web page.",
                "Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",

                "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",
                "Let wiq be the weight associated with term ti in the query q and wij be the weight associated with term ti in the document dj.",

                "In such schemes, weights are taken as the product between factors that quantify the importance of a term in a document (given by the term frequency, or tf, factor) and its rarity in the whole collection (given by the inverse document factor, or idf, factor), see [2] for details.",
                "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first matching strategy.",
                "It is represented by the function AD given by: AD(p, ai) = sim(p, ai) where AD stands for direct match of the ad, composed by title and description and sim(p, ai) is computed according to Eq. (1).",

                "With each advertisement ai an advertiser associates a keyword ki, which may be composed of one or more terms.",
                "We denote the association between an advertisement ai and a keyword ki as the pair (ai, ki) ∈ K, where K is the set of associations made by the advertisers.",
                "In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
                "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",
                "Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3.",
                "IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem.",
                "First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements.",
                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
                "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",
                "Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance.",
                "For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates our intuition.",
                "We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results.",
                "We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path.",
                "Our idea is to add new terms (words) to the Web page p to also reduce the vocabulary impedance by providing a second alternative matching path.",

                "To facilitate the matching between this ad and our triggering page p, we need to associate new general terms with p. For this, we assume that Web documents similar to the triggering page p share common topics.",
                "Therefore, 498 by inspecting the vocabulary of these similar documents we might find good terms for better characterizing the main topics in the page p. We now describe this idea using a Bayesian network model [10,11,13] depicted in Figure 3.",

Let N be the set of the k most similar documents to the triggering page, including the triggering page p itself, in a large enough Web collection C. Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",
                "In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.",
                "Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p. In other words, we are interested in the probability of observing the final evidence regarding a term ti, given that the new representation of the page p has been observed, P(Ti = 1|R = 1).",
                "This translates into the following equation1 : P(Ti|R) = 1 P(R) X d P(Ti|d)P(R|d)P(d) (2) where d represents the set of states of the document nodes.",
                "Since we are interested just in the states in which only a single document dj is observed and P(d) can be regarded as a constant, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as: P(Ti|R) = ν P(R) kX j=0 P(Ti|dj)P(R|dj) (3) where dj represents the state of the document nodes in which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 1 To simplify our notation we represent the probabilities P(X = 1) as P(X) and P(X = 0) as P(X). associated with P(dj).",

                "Notice that the set r might contain terms that already occur in p. That is, while we will refer to the set r as expansion terms, it should be clear that p ∩ r = ∅.",
                "By using α = 0, we simply consider the terms originally in page p. By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r. This is important because, sometimes, a topic apparently not important in the triggering page offers a good opportunity for advertising.",
                "For example, consider a triggering page that describes a congress in London about digital photography.",
                "Although London is probably not an important topic in this page, advertisements about hotels in London would be appropriate.",

                "As we observe in Figure 4, for the AD strategy, the best ranking is obtained by the use of campaign idf, that is, by calculating our idf factor so that it discriminates campaigns.",

                "This reflects the fact that terms might be better discriminators for a business topic than for an specific ad.",
                "This effect can be accomplished by calculating the factor relative to idf advertisers or campaigns instead of ads.",
                "In fact, campaign idf factors yielded the best results.",

                "As shown, directly matching the contents of the ad to the triggering page (AD strategy) is not so effective.",
                "The reason is that the ad contents are very noisy.",
                "It may contain messages that do not properly describe the ad topics such as requisitions for user actions (e.g, visit our site) and general sentences that could be applied to any product or service (e.g, we delivery for the whole country).",
                "On the other hand, an advertiser provided keyword summarizes well the topic of the ad.",
                "As a consequence, the KW strategy is superior to the AD and AD KW strategies.",
                "This situation changes when we require the keywords to appear in the target Web page.",
                "By filtering out ads whose keywords do not occur in the triggering page, much noise is discarded.",
                "This makes ANDKW a better alternative than KW.",
                "Further, in this new situation, the contents of the ad becomes useful to rank the most relevant ads making AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) the best among all described methods.",

                "RELATED WORK Several works have stressed the importance of relevance in advertising.",
                "For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",
                "Thus, in order to be effective, the authors conclude that advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the time of exposure.",
                "The results in [9] enforce this conclusion by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the more effective it is.",
                "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",
                "For instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online advertisement to a users short-term interests in a non-intrusive way.",
                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",
                "In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems.",
                "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",
                "As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising.",
                "Instead of dealing with keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse.",
                "Finally, the work in [4] focuses on improving search engine results in a TREC collection by means of an automatic query expansion method based on kNN [17].",
                "Such method resembles our expansion approach presented in section 3.",
                "Our method is different from that presented by [4].",

                "In our case, we use two collections: an advertisement and a Web collection.",
                "We expand triggering pages with terms extracted from the Web collection and then we match these expanded pages to the ads from the advertisement collection.",
                "By doing this, we emphasize the main topics of the triggering pages, increasing the possibility of associating relevant ads with them. 6.",
                "CONCLUSIONS In this work we investigated ten distinct strategies for associating ads with a Web page that is browsed (contenttargeted advertising).",
                "Five of our strategies attempt to match the ads directly to the Web page.",
                "Because of that, they are called matching strategies.",
                "The other five strategies recognize that there is a vocabulary impedance problem among ads and Web pages and attempt to solve the problem by expanding the Web pages and the ads with new terms.",
                "Because of that they are called impedance coupling strategies.",
                "Using a sample of a real case database with over 93 thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies.",
                "For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.",
                "This was obtained by a strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.",
                "For our five impedance coupling strategies, the results indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the AAK strategy) are possible.",
                "These were generated by expanding the Web page with new terms (obtained using a sample Web collection containing over five million pages) and the ads with the contents of the page they point to (a hyperlink provided by the advertisers).",

                "RELATED WORK Several works have stressed the importance of relevance in advertising.",
                "For example, in [14] it was shown that <br>advertise</br>ments that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",
                "Thus, in order to be effective, the authors conclude that <br>advertise</br>ments should be relevant to consumer concerns at the time of exposure.",
                "The results in [9] enforce this conclusion by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the more effective it is.",
                "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",
                "For instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online <br>advertise</br>ment to a users short-term interests in a non-intrusive way.",
                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between <br>advertise</br>rs and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",
                "In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems.",
                "Both systems select <br>advertise</br>ments by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting <br>advertise</br>ment list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each <br>advertise</br>ment as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",
                "As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising.",
                "Instead of dealing with keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse.",
                "Finally, the work in [4] focuses on improving search engine results in a TREC collection by means of an automatic query expansion method based on kNN [17].",

                "CONCLUSIONS In this work we investigated ten distinct strategies for associating ads with a Web page that is browsed (contenttargeted advertising).",
                "Five of our strategies attempt to match the ads directly to the Web page.",
                "Because of that, they are called matching strategies.",
                "The other five strategies recognize that there is a vocabulary impedance problem among ads and Web pages and attempt to solve the problem by expanding the Web pages and the ads with new terms.",
                "Because of that they are called impedance coupling strategies.",
                "Using a sample of a real case database with over 93 thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies.",
                "For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the <br>advertise</br>rs) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.",
                "This was obtained by a strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.",
                "For our five impedance coupling strategies, the results indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the AAK strategy) are possible.",
                "These were generated by expanding the Web page with new terms (obtained using a sample Web collection containing over five million pages) and the ads with the contents of the page they point to (a hyperlink provided by the <br>advertise</br>rs).",

                "This situation radically changed in the following decade when the failure of many <br>web</br> companies led to a dropping in supply of cheap venture capital and a considerable reduction in on-line advertising investments [15,16].",

                "Context-based advertising, which we address here, relies on matching ads and its associated keywords to the text of a <br>web</br> page.",
                "Given a certain <br>web</br> page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",
                "To illustrate, for the first ad by Google shown in Figure 1, the title is Star Wars Trilogy Full, the description is Get this popular DVD free.",

                "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",
                "Let wiq be the weight associated with term ti in the query q and wij be the weight associated with term ti in the document dj.",
                "Then, q = (w1q, w2q, ..., wiq, ..., wnq) and dj = (w1j, w2j, ..., wij, ..., wnj) are the weighted vectors used to represent the query q and the document dj.",
                "These weights can be computed using classic tf-idf schemes.",
                "In such schemes, weights are taken as the product between factors that quantify the importance of a term in a document (given by the term frequency, or tf, factor) and its rarity in the whole collection (given by the inverse document factor, or idf, factor), see [2] for details.",
                "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the <br>web</br> page p. This is our first matching strategy.",
                "It is represented by the function AD given by: AD(p, ai) = sim(p, ai) where AD stands for direct match of the ad, composed by title and description and sim(p, ai) is computed according to Eq. (1).",

                "In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
                "In here, we use them to match ads to the <br>web</br> page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",

                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that <br>web</br> pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than <br>web</br> pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",

By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r.

                "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",
                "For instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online advertisement to a users short-term interests in a non-intrusive way.",
                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",
                "In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems.",
                "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",
                "As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising.",
                "Instead of dealing with keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse.",
                "Finally, the work in [4] focuses on improving search engine results in a TREC collection by means of an automatic query expansion method based on kNN [17].",

                "Five of our strategies attempt to match the ads directly to the <br>web</br> page.",
                "Because of that, they are called matching strategies.",
                "The other five strategies recognize that there is a vocabulary impedance problem among ads and <br>web</br> pages and attempt to solve the problem by expanding the <br>web</br> pages and the ads with new terms.",
                "Because of that they are called impedance coupling strategies.",
                "Using a sample of a real case database with over 93 thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies.",
                "For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.",
                "This was obtained by a strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.",
                "For our five impedance coupling strategies, the results indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the AAK strategy) are possible.",
                "These were generated by expanding the <br>web</br> page with new terms (obtained using a sample <br>web</br> collection containing over five million pages) and the ads with the contents of the page they point to (a hyperlink provided by the advertisers).",

                "Context-based advertising, which we address here, relies on matching ads and its associated keywords to the text of a Web page.",
                "Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",
                "To illustrate, for the first ad by Google shown in Figure 1, the title is Star Wars Trilogy Full, the description is Get this popular DVD free.",

                "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",

                "These weights can be computed using classic tf-idf schemes.",
                "In such schemes, weights are taken as the product between factors that quantify the importance of a term in a document (given by the term frequency, or tf, factor) and its rarity in the whole collection (given by the inverse document factor, or idf, factor), see [2] for details.",
                "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first matching strategy.",
                "It is represented by the function AD given by: AD(p, ai) = sim(p, ai) where AD stands for direct match of the ad, composed by title and description and sim(p, ai) is computed according to Eq. (1).",
                "In our second method, we use other source of evidence provided by the advertisers: the keywords.",
                "With each advertisement ai an advertiser associates a keyword ki, which may be composed of one or more terms.",
                "We denote the association between an advertisement ai and a keyword ki as the pair (ai, ki) ∈ K, where K is the set of associations made by the advertisers.",
                "In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
                "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",
                "Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3.",
                "IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem.",
                "First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements.",
                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
                "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",
                "Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance.",
                "For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates our intuition.",
                "We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results.",
                "We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path.",
                "Our idea is to add new terms (words) to the Web page p to also reduce the vocabulary impedance by providing a second alternative matching path.",

                "To facilitate the matching between this ad and our triggering page p, we need to associate new general terms with p. For this, we assume that Web documents similar to the triggering page p share common topics.",
                "Therefore, 498 by inspecting the vocabulary of these similar documents we might find good terms for better characterizing the main topics in the page p. We now describe this idea using a <br>bayesian network</br> model [10,11,13] depicted in Figure 3.",

Let N be the set of the k most similar documents to the triggering page, including the triggering page p itself, in a large enough Web collection C. Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",
                "In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.",
                "Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p. In other words, we are interested in the probability of observing the final evidence regarding a term ti, given that the new representation of the page p has been observed, P(Ti = 1|R = 1).",

                "Since we are interested just in the states in which only a single document dj is observed and P(d) can be regarded as a constant, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as: P(Ti|R) = ν P(R) kX j=0 P(Ti|dj)P(R|dj) (3) where dj represents the state of the document nodes in which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 1 To simplify our notation we represent the probabilities P(X = 1) as P(X) and P(X = 0) as P(X). associated with P(dj).",

By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r.

                "For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",

                "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",

                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",

                "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",

                "Given a certain Web page p, which we call triggering page, our task is to select advertisements related to the contents of p. Without loss of generality, we consider that an advertisement ai is composed of a title, a textual description, and a hyperlink.",
                "To illustrate, for the first ad by Google shown in Figure 1, the title is Star Wars Trilogy Full, the description is Get this popular DVD free.",

                "Given our triggering page p and a set A of ads, a simple way of ranking ai ∈ A with regard to p is by matching the contents of p to the contents of ai.",
                "For this, we use the vector space model [2], as discussed in the immediately following.",
                "In the vector space model, queries and documents are represented as weighted vectors in an n-dimensional space.",

                "The ranking of the query q with regard to the document dj is computed by the cosine similarity 497 formula, that is, the cosine of the angle between the two corresponding vectors: sim(q, dj) = q • dj |q| × |dj| = Pn i=1 wiq · wij qPn i=1 w2 iq qPn i=1 w2 ij (1) By considering p as the query and ai as the document, we can rank the ads with regard to the Web page p. This is our first matching strategy.",

                "In the case of keyword targeted advertising, such keywords are used to match the ads to the user queries.",
                "In here, we use them to match ads to the Web page p. This provides our second method for ad matching given by: KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and KW stands for match the ad keywords.",
                "We notice that most of the keywords selected by advertisers are also present in the ads associated with those keywords.",
                "For instance, in our advertisement test collection, this is true for 90% of the ads.",
                "Thus, instead of using the keywords as matching devices, we can use them to emphasize the main concepts in an ad, in an attempt to improve our AD strategy.",
                "This leads to our third method of ad matching given by: AD KW(p, ai) = sim(p, ai ∪ ki) where (ai, ki) ∈ K and AD KW stands for match the ad and its keywords.",
                "Finally, it is important to notice that the keyword ki associated with ai could not appear at all in the triggering page p, even when ai is highly ranked.",
                "However, if we assume that ki summarizes the main topic of ai according to an advertiser viewpoint, it can be interesting to assure its presence in p. This reasoning suggests that requiring the occurrence of the keyword ki in the triggering page p as a condition to associate ai with p might lead to improved results.",
                "This leads to two extra matching strategies as follows: ANDKW(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai) if ki p 0 if otherwise AD ANDKW(p, ai) = AAK(p, ai) =  sim(p, ai ∪ ki) if ki p 0 if otherwise where (ai, ki) ∈ K, ANDKW stands for match the ad keywords and force their appearance, and AD ANDKW (or AAK for ads and keywords) stands for match the ad, its keywords, and force their appearance.",
                "As we will see in our results, the best among these simple methods is AAK.",
                "Thus, it will be used as baseline for our impedance coupling strategies which we now discuss. 3.",
                "IMPEDANCE COUPLING STRATEGIES Two key issues become clear as one plays with the contenttargeted advertising problem.",
                "First, the triggering page normally belongs to a broader contextual scope than that of the advertisements.",
                "Second, the association between a good advertisement and the triggering page might depend on a topic that is not mentioned explicitly in the triggering page.",
                "The first issue is due to the fact that Web pages can be about any subject and that advertisements are concise in nature.",
                "That is, ads tend to be more topic restricted than Web pages.",
                "The second issue is related to the fact that, as we later discuss, most advertisers place a small number of advertisements.",
                "As a result, we have few terms describing their interest areas.",
                "Consequently, these terms tend to be of a more general nature.",
                "For instance, a car shop probably would prefer to use car instead of super sport to describe its core business topic.",
                "As a consequence, many specific terms that appear in the triggering page find no match in the advertisements.",
                "To make matters worst, a page might refer to an entity or subject of the world through a label that is distinct from the label selected by an advertiser to refer to the same entity.",
                "A consequence of these two issues is that vocabularies of pages and ads have low intersection, even when an ad is related to a page.",
                "We cite this problem from now on as the vocabulary impedance problem.",
                "In our experiments, we realized that this problem limits the final quality of direct matching strategies.",
                "Therefore, we studied alternatives to reduce the referred vocabulary impedance.",
                "For this, we propose to expand the triggering pages with new terms.",
                "Figure 2 illustrates our intuition.",
                "We already know that the addition of keywords (selected by the advertiser) to the ads leads to improved results.",
                "We say that a keyword reduces the vocabulary impedance by providing an alternative matching path.",
                "Our idea is to add new terms (words) to the Web page p to also reduce the vocabulary impedance by providing a second alternative matching path.",

Root nodes D0 through Dk represent the documents in N, that is, the triggering page D0 and its k nearest neighbors, D1 through Dk, among all pages in C. There is an edge from node Dj to node R if document dj is in N. Nodes T1 through Tm represent the terms in the vocabulary of C. There is an edge from node Dj to a node Ti if term ti occurs in document dj.",
                "In our model, the observation of the pages in N leads to the observation of a new representation of the triggering page p and to a set of terms describing the main topics associated with p and its neighbors.",
                "Given these definitions, we can now use the network to determine the probability that a term ti is a good term for representing a topic of the triggering page p. In other words, we are interested in the probability of observing the final evidence regarding a term ti, given that the new representation of the page p has been observed, P(Ti = 1|R = 1).",
                "This translates into the following equation1 : P(Ti|R) = 1 P(R) X d P(Ti|d)P(R|d)P(d) (2) where d represents the set of states of the document nodes.",
                "Since we are interested just in the states in which only a single document dj is observed and P(d) can be regarded as a constant, we can rewrite Eq. (2) as: P(Ti|R) = ν P(R) kX j=0 P(Ti|dj)P(R|dj) (3) where dj represents the state of the document nodes in which only document dj is observed and ν is a constant 1 To simplify our notation we represent the probabilities P(X = 1) as P(X) and P(X = 0) as P(X). associated with P(dj).",

By increasing α, we relax the context of the page p, adding terms from neighbor pages, turning page p into its new representation r.

                "For example, in [14] it was shown that advertisements that are presented to users when they are not interested on them are viewed just as annoyance.",
                "Thus, in order to be effective, the authors conclude that advertisements should be relevant to consumer concerns at the time of exposure.",
                "The results in [9] enforce this conclusion by pointing out that the more targeted the advertising, the more effective it is.",
                "Therefore it is not surprising that other works have addressed the relevance issue.",
                "For instance, in [8] it is proposed a system called ADWIZ that is able to adapt online advertisement to a users short-term interests in a non-intrusive way.",
                "Contrary to our work, ADWIZ does not directly use the content of the page viewed by the user.",
                "It relies on search keywords supplied by the user to search engines and on the URL of the page requested by the user.",
                "On the other hand, in [7] the authors presented an intrusive approach in which an agent sits between advertisers and the users browser allowing a banner to be placed into the currently viewed page.",
                "In spite of having the opportunity to use the pages content, 502 the agent infers relevance based on category information and users private information collected along the time.",
                "In [5] the authors provide a comparison between the ranking strategies used by Google and Overture for their keyword advertising systems.",
                "Both systems select advertisements by matching them to the keywords provided by the user in a search query and rank the resulting advertisement list according to the advertisers willingness to pay.",
                "In particular, Google approach also considers the clickthrough rate of each advertisement as an additional evidence for its relevance.",
                "The authors conclude that Googles strategy is better than that used by Overture.",
                "As mentioned before, the ranking problem in keyword advertising is different from that of content-targeted advertising.",
                "Instead of dealing with keywords provided by users in search queries, we have to deal with the contents of a page which can be very diffuse.",

                "Because of that, they are called matching strategies.",

                "Because of that they are called impedance coupling strategies.",
                "Using a sample of a real case database with over 93 thousand ads, we evaluated our strategies.",
                "For the five matching strategies, our results indicated that planned consideration of additional evidence (such as the keywords provided by the advertisers) yielded gains in average precision figures (for our test collection) of 60%.",
                "This was obtained by a strategy called AAK (for ads and keywords), which is taken as the baseline for evaluating our more advanced impedance coupling strategies.",
                "For our five impedance coupling strategies, the results indicate that additional gains in average precision of 50% (now relative to the AAK strategy) are possible.",
